       <p> Techniques are disclosed relating to facilitating transactions via mobile
     devices. In one embodiment, an account that is linked to a mobile
     telephone number of a mobile device is established at a computer system.
     In such an embodiment, the account permits a user to make and receive
     payments, and is not accessible without using the mobile device. In some
     embodiments, the account is established without setting up a username and
     password. In one embodiment, a request is sent from a payment application
     of the mobile device to the computer system. In some embodiments, the
     payment application is made active on the mobile device in response to a
     user input within a different application running on the mobile device.
     After the payment application is active, a purchase is confirmed within
     the payment application such that the request is sent responsive to the
     confirming and without authenticating the user within the payment
     application.

<br/><br/> 1.  Technical Field
<br/><br/> This disclosure relates generally to transaction systems, and, more specifically, to facilitating transactions via mobile devices.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of the Related Art
<br/><br/> Various mobile payment applications (i.e., programs that run on a mobile device) currently exist that enable a user to transfer funds to another person.  Some of these applications are offered by financial institutions and payment services. 
These applications may allow a user to transfer funds, view an account balance, find a location of a nearby ATM, pay bills, etc. Some applications allow a user to make deposits by taking pictures of checks.  In many instances, however, the user
interfaces associated with these mobile payment applications are subpar, and thus do not result in the best possible experience for the user.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> The present disclosure describes embodiments in which an improved mobile payment application executing on a mobile device allows a user to make or receive a payment via a mobile payment service.  In certain embodiments, a user's account with the
mobile payment service may be linked to the mobile device's mobile telephone number.  In certain embodiments, a user's account is not accessible without using the mobile device in some manner to access the account.  In such embodiments, the mobile
payment account cannot be accessed, for example, by supplying a username and password to a website, without use of the mobile device.  In some embodiments, a user's mobile payment account may not have an associated username and password, and may only be
accessed using the mobile device (e.g., via the mobile payment application executing on the mobile device).  In these embodiments, the mobile payment service may not use email to communicate with the user regarding the account.  In other embodiments, the
account may have an associated username and password, which may be used in conjunction with the user's mobile device to access the user's account via a website interface.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the mobile payment application can be used in conjunction with other applications to facilitate a transaction.  For example, a user may indicate a selection via a user interface in a third-party application (e.g., indicating
a desire to initiate a purchase via the mobile payment application).  This selection may, in some embodiments, cause the mobile payment application to become active (i.e., the current application that the user is interacting with).  The mobile payment
application may then initiate the transaction (for example, after allowing the user to confirm the transaction) without requiring the user to reauthorize himself or herself.  In this manner, the user can have a more elegant mobile payment experience.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Mobile Application (FIGS. 1-4)
<br/><br/> FIGS. 1-4 depict exemplary screenshots of a registration process for a mobile application 100 (named "Clover" in the figures).  In one embodiment, the mobile application may facilitate making and receiving payments using a mobile device (e.g.,
smartphone) that has an associated mobile number 110.  The mobile application is configured to communicate with a computer system that is configured to register the user by establishing an account.  In one embodiment, the computer system's authentication
system locks an account to a particular phone number, such that the system maintains only one account per mobile number.  The mobile application may permit "reclaiming" or overwriting a previous account (e.g., via selection options 200 in FIG. 2) if
there is already an account associated with a particular number.  In one embodiment, the mobile application may utilize a combination of a mobile device's mobile number, SSL, and various on-device security settings to verify a mobile number over a
network.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 depicts the use of a personal identification (PIN) code 300.  This may be established during the registration process in one embodiment.  A PIN may be used in some circumstances to verify a mobile payment or other transaction (e.g., a
user can set a parameter that all transactions over a specified amount require entry of a PIN on the device, etc.).
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, the account is established without setting up a username and password that would permit the user to access his or her account without the use of the mobile device.  Thus, in these embodiments, there is no website that the
user could log onto using a username/password combination.  In the same vein, the computer system may not use email to communicate with the user (e.g., regarding the account), since such communications are susceptible to phishing.  As described below,
however, in some embodiments, access to a user's account via a website may be possible in conjunction with the mobile device.  Thus, in such embodiments, the user's account is not accessible without using the mobile device.  Account recovery techniques
are described below for instances in which a user loses his or her mobile device or PIN.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 depicts a screenshot of a screen for facilitating a user inviting contacts to also establish accounts with the mobile payment service.  This may be done in some embodiments by selecting from a user's existing contacts 400 (on the mobile
device or a third-party service such as <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> LINKEDIN, etc.), or by the use of a quick response (QR) code, a type of two-dimensional barcode known in the art.
<br/><br/> Determination of Fraud Risks
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a computer system associated with a mobile payment service may attach additional data to a user account that may enhance or limit the user's use of the service.  Generally speaking, such additional data may be used to assess
fraud risk of the user.  In some instances, this additional data may originate from information indicative of social relationships (e.g., <b><i>FACEBOOK</i></b> friends).  For example, credit information for those individuals listed as the user's social contacts may
be used to decrease (or increase) the amount of money the user may transact in using the system.  Similarly, GPS or other location data may also be used to assess fraud risk, such as when the location data indicates the mobile device is outside the
United States or some other specified geographic area (which may be the case if the mobile device is stolen.)
<br/><br/> Making and Receiving Payments via Mobile Interface (FIGS. 5-11)
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 indicates one example of a mobile payment application user interface.  In addition to account settings, the interface includes a payment icon 510 to make a payment, request icon 520 to request a payment, scan icon 530 to scan a barcode
(e.g., QR code), and invite icon 540 to invite other users to join the system.  The exemplary interface also includes a list of recent transactions 550.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a payment can be made by selecting one of the user contacts 600 (FIG. 6).  This involves linking account identifiers with customer data including phone number, name, social network IDs, and emails.  This information can be
added manually or by importing this data from the mobile device's address book or customer's social network databases.  Alternately, a payment can be made by requesting the system to generate a barcode (e.g., by entering an amount 710 and selecting a pay
button 720 in FIG. 7) that enables another customer to receive money via the mobile payment system.  All instructions for completing the transaction are embedded in the code.  FIG. 8 depicts receipt of the barcode 800 by the payee (e.g., via email, text
message, Tweet, other electronic message, or hardcopy).  In one embodiment, the mobile payment application includes scanning functionality that is able to scan the barcode (e.g., by using the mobile device's camera) and execute the embedded instructions,
resulting in having the payment specified by the barcode credited to the user's account.  FIG. 9 shows an exemplary payment confirmation 900 that may be displayed upon a payment being successfully sent by a payee.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a request for money can be made in a similar manner in that the user may select a user contact or generate a barcode.  The other customer may then approve the payment request.  The paying customer may also request additional
information to fulfill the payment, for instance by asking for a shipping address or contact details as part of the order.  FIG. 10 shows the use of the mobile payment application to request money from a contact.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 shows the use of the mobile payment application to display a user's transaction history 1100.
<br/><br/> Interfacing with Other Mobile Applications (FIGS. 12 and 13)
<br/><br/> Third-party developers can integrate Clover using a small piece of code that directs their customer to switch quickly to the Clover application to make a payment.  This works for mobile HTML as well as native applications like iPhone and
Android.  If the customer doesn't have the application, he or she is directed to the store to download it and once the account is created complete the flow.  The customer is returned to the app with confirmation and any details, like shipping info,
immediately after approving the purchase.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, third-party developers may integrate support for the mobile payment application into their applications.  For example, FIG. 12 depicts a third-party application 1200 in which a user may purchase tickets and pay for the
tickets using the mobile payment application.  Third-party developers may support the mobile application by inserting code that directs their customer to switch quickly to the mobile payment application to make a payment.  For example, in FIG. 12, an
icon 1210 that is selectable to indicate a desire to use payment application 100 is inserted into third-party application 1200.  This works for mobile HTML as well as native applications like those on iPhone and Android devices.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, payment application 100 is made active (i.e., invoked) on the mobile device in response to a user input within the third-party application running on the mobile device.  For example, in one embodiment, selecting icon 1210
may cause application 1200 to submit a call to the underlining operating system on the mobile device.  This call may result in the operating system performing a context switch causing payment application 100 to become active (i.e., be currently displayed
to the user).  After the payment application is active, the purchase may be confirmed within the payment application.  For example, in FIG. 13, a user may confirm or reject the payment via confirmation options 1300.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, payment may be authorized without authenticating the user within the payment application.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 12 and 13, application 100 does not present a user authentication interface after icon 1210 has been
selected and application 100 is made active.  Rather, application 100 proceeds directly to presenting confirmation options 1300.  In doing so, the payment process is simplified for the user allowing the user to quickly purchase items.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the user is returned to the third-party application after the payment has been confirmed and the payment request has been sent to the mobile payment service.  Upon return, the user may be asked to provide additional payment
details such as a delivery method, shipping info, etc.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, third-party support may be implemented such that the user is directed to a store to download the mobile application if the user does not have the payment application already installed on the mobile device.  For example, a
selection of icon 1210 within application 1200 may cause the user to be directed to a store usable to download payment application 100.  After downloading and installing the application, the user may establish an account with the mobile payment service
as discussed above.  The user may then be permitted to proceed with payment as if the application were already installed to begin with.
<br/><br/> Use of Barcodes (FIGS. 14-18)
<br/><br/> Once a barcode is generated, a user may include it in various electronic media, including a mobile web page, mobile application, web application, attachment an electronic communication (email message, text message, Tweet, etc.), and so on. 
Additionally, a barcode may be printed.  However the barcode is delivered, the mobile device of the payee may be used to scan the barcode and then implement the instructions embedded in the barcode (e.g., by using a scanner and barcode reader, which may
be functions of the mobile payment application in one embodiment).  FIGS. 7-9 illustrate the use of a barcode within a mobile application, while FIGS. 14-18 illustrate the use of a barcode to purchase an item via a webpage by using a mobile device to
scan a barcode 1400 (FIGS. 14 and 15) and then authorize purchase of the item e.g., via selections 1600 (FIG. 16) and 1700 (FIG. 17).  A payment confirmation 1800 (FIG. 18) may be displayed upon completion of the purchase.
<br/><br/> One type of barcode is an invite barcode, used to invite other users to the mobile payment service.  Alternatively, a barcode may be a payment barcode, which is usable by the recipient to receive a payment.  A request for payment barcode is used
by a payor to pay a payee.  For example, at a garage sale, different request for payment barcodes could be positioned next to items for sale.  A user not wishing to carry or utilize cash for a transaction could use a mobile payment application running on
his or her mobile device to scan the request for payment barcode to effectuate a transfer to the seller.  One of many other possible examples is the use of a barcode on a tip jar at a coffee shop.
<br/><br/> Still further, after making a purchase on a mobile device, a user may be sent a barcode.  Scanning the barcode could act to authenticate the purchase, and in some embodiments, dynamically update the order status of an item on a web page.
<br/><br/> Configuring Account via Mobile Device (FIGS. 19-21)
<br/><br/> Once an account is established, various forms of payments can be associated with the account (credit, debit, PAYPAL, ACH, etc.).  Money may be added to (or withdrawn from) the account using any of the sources.  FIGS. 19-21 illustrate that such
information may be entered using the mobile device.
<br/><br/> Account Access via Web Using Mobile Device
<br/><br/> One of the drawbacks of a mobile device is that data entry is typically more cumbersome than with other computing devices (e.g., those having a standard size keyboard and pointing device).  Thus, in some embodiments, a user may visit a website
associated with the mobile payment service in order to add certain information to the account (e.g., credit card information, which may be entered once or infrequently).  Because in some instances there is no username/password associated with a user's
account, the user may instead use his or her mobile device to scan a barcode displayed on the website.  The mobile device can then execute the instructions embedded in the barcode, which can in turn authorize the website to accept account updates from
that particular computer on which the website is displayed, possibly for a limited amount of time.
<br/><br/> Account Recovery Techniques for Mobile Application
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a secondary phone number may be used as a means of securing a new PIN or to reset the account if the customer loses the mobile device or the PIN.  In various embodiments, the mobile payment system might call or text reset
instructions to the backup phone number.  In other instances, the mobile payment system might accept a phone call only from the specified backup number.
<br/><br/> In other cases, voice recognition might be used for security purposes.  During account establishment, the customer's voice may be recorded while speaking a requested security phrase.  During a reset request, the customer would be prompted to
repeat the phrase and the two voice samples would be compared to determine the customer's authenticity.
<br/><br/> Use of Security Images in Mobile Applications
<br/><br/> As a security measure, multiple photos may be presented to a customer, allowing the customer to select one as a security question.  For instance, one set of photos may allow a customer to select his or her favorite brand of car.  The customer
would then be presented with a selection of photos as a challenge question in the future.  This enables the customer to answer a question on a mobile device without having to type on the keypad.
<br/><br/> Similarly, a customer's personal photos or social network photos may be another way of allowing the customer to know that a payment transaction is legitimately associated with the mobile payment service.  Customers would be presented with an
image they selected from their album whenever the mobile payment service asks them to make a payment or verify their PIN.  If the image is not present, they should not proceed.
<br/><br/> Methods and Systems (FIGS. 22-25)
<br/><br/> FIG. 22 depicts a method 2200 for making payments via a mobile payment application.  In one embodiment, method 2200 is performed by a computer system associated with a mobile payment service.  Accordingly, such a computer system may interact
with a mobile device executing a mobile payment application such as described above.  In the illustrated embodiment, method 2200 includes, at step 2210, establishing an account that is linked to a mobile telephone number of a mobile device.  In one
embodiment, the account permits a user to make and receive payments; however, the account is not accessible without using the mobile device.  In some embodiments, step 2210 may include determining that a previous account already exists for the mobile
telephone number and overwriting the previous account to establish the account such that the mobile telephone number is associated with only a single account (as discussed above with respect to FIG. 2).  In some embodiments, step 2210 may include
establishing a personal identification number (PIN) for the user such that the mobile device requires user entry of the PIN for payment transactions that satisfy a set of user-specified criteria (as discussed above with respect to FIG. 3).  In some
embodiments, step 2210 may include inviting contacts of the user to establish accounts with the mobile payment system (as discussed above with respect to FIG. 4).
<br/><br/> FIG. 23 depicts another method 2300 for making payments via a mobile payment application.  In one embodiment, method 2300 is performed by a computer system associated with a mobile payment service such as described above.  In the illustrated
embodiment, method 2300 includes, at step 2310, receiving a request to make or receive a payment via a mobile payment account associated with a mobile device having a mobile telephone number.  In some embodiments, the request may identify a payer, a
payee, and/or a payment amount as specified by a user of the mobile application.  Method 2300 further includes, at step 2320, processing the request via the account.  In one embodiment, step 2320 includes generating a barcode (e.g., barcode 800) that
includes embedded instructions for making a payment to a payee.
<br/><br/> FIG. 24 depicts yet another method 2400 for making payments via a mobile payment application.  In one embodiment, method 2400 is performed by a mobile device executing a mobile payment application such as application 100 described above.  In the
illustrated embodiment, method 2400 includes, at step 2410, sending a request from a payment application of a mobile device to a computer system.  In such an embodiment, the request is to make or receive a payment via an account of a user that is
associated with the payment application.  In some embodiments, method 2400 further includes making the payment application active on the mobile device in response to a user input within a different application running on the mobile device.  In one
embodiment, the user input indicates selection of the payment application for facilitating payment for the purchase.  In some embodiments, method 2400 further includes, after the payment application is active, confirming a purchase within the payment
application such that the sending of the request is performed responsive to the confirming and without authenticating the user within the payment application (such as discussed above with respect to FIGS. 12 and 13).  In some embodiments, method 2400
further includes, in response to sending the request, returning the user from the payment application to the different application.  In one embodiment, the different application displays confirmation details indicative of the payment.
<br/><br/> FIG. 25 depicts a block diagram of an exemplary computer system 2500 that may implement functionality described herein.  Accordingly, in one embodiment, computer system 2500 is a computer system that interfaces with a mobile device that executes
the mobile payment application.  In another embodiment, computer system 2500 is a mobile device that executes the mobile payment application.  In still another embodiment, computer system 2500 is a computer system that presents a website that offers
support for making payments via the mobile payment application.
<br/><br/> In the illustrated embodiment, computer system 2500 includes a processor subsystem 2580 that is coupled to a system memory 2520 and I/O interfaces(s) 2540 via an interconnect 2560 (e.g., a system bus).  I/O interface(s) 2540 is coupled to one or
more I/O devices 2550.  Computer system 2500 may be any of various types of devices, including, but not limited to, a server system, personal computer system, desktop computer, laptop or notebook computer, mainframe computer system, handheld computer,
workstation, network computer, a consumer device such as a mobile phone, pager, or personal data assistant (PDA).  Although a single computer system 2500 is shown in FIG. 25 for convenience, system 2500 may also be implemented as two or more computer
systems operating together.
<br/><br/> Processor subsystem 2580 may include one or more processors or processing units.  In various embodiments of computer system 2500, multiple instances of processor subsystem 2580 may be coupled to interconnect 2560.  In various embodiments,
processor subsystem 2580 (or each processor unit within 2580) may contain a cache or other form of on-board memory.
<br/><br/> System memory 2520 is usable by processor subsystem 2580.  System memory 2520 may be implemented using different physical memory media, such as hard disk storage, floppy disk storage, removable disk storage, flash memory, random access memory
(RAM-SRAM, EDO RAM, SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, RAMBUS RAM, etc.), read only memory (PROM, EEPROM, etc.), and so on.  Memory in computer system 2500 is not limited to primary storage such as memory 2520.  Rather, computer system 2500 may also include other forms
of storage such as cache memory in processor subsystem 2580 and secondary storage on I/O Devices 2550 (e.g., a hard drive, storage array, etc.).  In some embodiments, these other forms of storage may also store program instructions executable by
processor subsystem 2580.  As used herein, a computer readable medium may refer to any form of medium that stores program instructions executable by one or more processors.  The term computer readable medium is not used to connote only a transitory
medium such as a carrier wave, but rather refers to non-transitory media such as those enumerated above.
<br/><br/> I/O interfaces 2540 may be any of various types of interfaces configured to couple to and communicate with other devices, according to various embodiments.  In one embodiment, I/O interface 2540 is a bridge chip (e.g., Southbridge) from a
front-side to one or more back-side buses.  I/O interfaces 2540 may be coupled to one or more I/O devices 2550 via one or more corresponding buses or other interfaces.  Examples of I/O devices include storage devices (hard drive, optical drive, removable
flash drive, storage array, SAN, or their associated controller), network interface devices (e.g., to a local or wide-area network), or other devices (e.g., graphics, user interface devices, etc.).  In one embodiment, computer system 2500 is coupled to a
network via a network interface device.
<br/><br/> The various methods as illustrated in the figures and described herein represent example embodiments only.  The methods may be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination thereof.  The order of these methods may be changed, and various
elements may be added, reordered, combined, omitted, modified, etc. Various modifications and changes may be made by a person of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this specification.  It is intended that the specification embrace all such
modifications and changes and, accordingly, the above description to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.
