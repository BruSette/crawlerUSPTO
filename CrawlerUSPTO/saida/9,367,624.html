<br/><br/> The disclosed embodiments relate generally to methods and apparatus for processing requests pertaining to user accounts.
<br/><br/> User accounts may be created or set up for a variety of purposes.  More particularly, user accounts may enable users to access a computer system or Internet services such as electronic mail.  In addition, users may purchase goods or services in
association with user accounts.
<br/><br/> A user account may be an Internet-based entity owned by or assigned to a particular user, but stored and maintained by an organization.  Since the organization may maintain an enormous number of accounts, managing these accounts can be a time
consuming and complex task.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> The disclosed embodiments enable requests pertaining to user accounts to be processed.  More particularly, requests may be processed based, at least in part, upon an account type of the user accounts and/or a request type of the requests.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, an indication of a request pertaining to a user account may be obtained, where the user account is associated with at least one user.  A request type of the request may be determined.  In addition, an account type of the user
account may be determined, where the account type is one of two or more account types.  One or more actions indicated by the request may be performed based, at least in part, upon the account type and/or the request type.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, an indication of a request pertaining to a user account may be obtained, where the user account is associated with at least one user.  An account type of the user account may be determined, where the account type is one of
two or more account types.  One or more actions indicated by the request may be performed based, at least in part, upon the account type.
<br/><br/> Various embodiments may be implemented via a device comprising a processor, memory, and a display.  The processor and memory are configured to perform one or more of the above described method operations.  Other embodiments may be implemented

it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the disclosure to these embodiments.  On the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined
by the appended claims.  In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosure.  The disclosed embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details.  In
other instances, well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the disclosure.  The Detailed Description is not intended as an extensive or detailed discussion of known concepts, and as such,
details that are known generally to those of ordinary skill in the relevant art may have been omitted or may be handled in summary fashion.
<br/><br/> Subject matter will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and which show, by way of illustration, specific example embodiments.  Subject matter may, however, be embodied in
a variety of different forms and, therefore, covered or claimed subject matter is intended to be construed as not being limited to any example embodiments set forth herein; example embodiments are provided merely to be illustrative.  Likewise, a
reasonably broad scope for claimed or covered subject matter is intended.  Among other things, for example, subject matter may be embodied as methods, devices, components, or systems.  Accordingly, embodiments may, for example, take the form of hardware,
software, firmware or any combination thereof (other than software per se).  The following detailed description is, therefore, not intended to be taken in a limiting sense.
<br/><br/> Throughout the specification and claims, terms may have nuanced meanings suggested or implied in context beyond an explicitly stated meaning.  Likewise, the phrase "in one embodiment" as used herein does not necessarily refer to the same
embodiment and the phrase "in another embodiment" as used herein does not necessarily refer to a different embodiment.  It is intended, for example, that claimed subject matter include combinations of example embodiments in whole or in part.
<br/><br/> In general, terminology may be understood at least in part from usage in context.  For example, terms, such as "and", "or", or "and/or," as used herein may include a variety of meanings that may depend at least in part upon the context in which
such terms are used.  Typically, "or" if used to associate a list, such as A, B or C, is intended to mean A, B, and C, here used in the inclusive sense, as well as A, B or C, here used in the exclusive sense.  In addition, the term "one or more" as used
herein, depending at least in part upon context, may be used to describe any feature, structure, or characteristic in a singular sense or may be used to describe combinations of features, structures or characteristics in a plural sense.  Similarly,
terms, such as "a," "an," or "the," again, may be understood to convey a singular usage or to convey a plural usage, depending at least in part upon context.  In addition, the term "based on" may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an
exclusive set of factors and may, instead, allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described, again, depending at least in part on context.
<br/><br/> User accounts may have a complex relationship with one another.  For example, two or more accounts such as partner accounts may depend upon one another.  As another example, an account (e.g., a partner account) may control the account lifecycle
of another account (e.g., another partner account).  Accordingly, account lifecycles can be complex.
<br/><br/> In some instances, accounts may be entirely independent from one another.  As a result, there may be many unused (e.g., orphaned) accounts.  It may therefore be desirable to eliminate these unused accounts.  To support the removal of millions of
inactive accounts, it may be desirable to implement fast performance.  However, to manage complex accounts, which may not be independent from one another, it may be desirable to implement a system with high flexibility that can support dynamic scheduling
and timing.  Unfortunately, these two goals can be conflicting.
<br/><br/> In accordance with various embodiments, processing of requests (i.e., commands) pertaining to user accounts of various account types may be implemented by various lifecycles for which different types of processing behaviors are performed.  Such
processing behaviors may include different types of scheduling, queuing, and/or storage behaviors, which will process the appropriate action(s) according to the proper timeline.  For example, an account may be deactivated, but the data maintained in
association with the account may be deleted 90 days after the account is deactivated.
<br/><br/> Various storage engines and databases have various limitations and benefits.  As a result, using a single storage engine or database can be difficult.  Therefore, as will be described in further detail below, multiple storage engines, databases,
and/or queues may be implemented.
<br/><br/> As will be described in further detail below, an account workflow system may manage various types of accounts and requests (i.e., commands) pertaining to the accounts through the use of various storage engines, databases, and/or queues.  More
particularly, the account workflow system may adjust its queuing and/or storage behavior by utilizing multiple storage engines, databases, and/or queues.  The account workflow system may examine a request pertaining to an account and based upon a type of
the request, an account type of the account, and/or state of the account, the request may be processed in an optimal manner by storing information pertaining to the request to a selected storage engine, database, and/or queue.  In this manner, the
account workflow system may manage different account lifecycle models.
<br/><br/> Example System
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an example system in which various embodiments.  As shown in FIG. 1, the system may include one or more servers 102, which may be associated with a web site such as a social networking web site.  Examples of
social networking web sites include Yahoo, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Tumblr, LinkedIn, Flickr, and Meme.  The server(s) 102 may enable the web site to provide a variety of services to its users.  More particularly, users of the web site may create, activate, update,
delete, deactivate, or otherwise change the status or state of user accounts by submitting a corresponding request.  In addition, users of the web site may access user accounts or public user profiles, interact with other members of the web site, upload
files (e.g., photographs, videos), purchase goods or services, access information posted on the web site, etc.
<br/><br/> In this example, the server(s) 102 may obtain or otherwise receive data (e.g., account data and/or user profile) and/or requests (e.g., search requests or account requests pertaining to a particular user account).  Requests may include those
generated automatically within the system (e.g., in response to a particular user event or type of user event).  Moreover, requests may include requests sent via the Internet 104 from one or more computers 106, 108, 110 in association with corresponding
entities 112, 114, 116, respectively.  For example, each of the entities 112, 114, 116 may be an individual such as a user of the web site or an individual operating on behalf of a group of individuals (e.g., group, business, company, or web site).
<br/><br/> The server(s) 102 may have access to one or more data stores 118, which may include one or more memories.  More particularly, the data stores 118 may include one or more master account data store(s) (e.g., account databases), which may include
account information (e.g., data) for a plurality of user accounts.  Therefore, information pertaining to user accounts may be retained in one or more memories that are coupled to the server 102.
<br/><br/> In addition, the data stores 118 may include two or more types of data stores for use in processing account requests.  For example, the data stores 118 may include one or more relational databases (e.g., SQL databases), as well as one or more
non-relational databases (e.g., non-SQL databases).  Example processes for implementing two or more types of data stores will be described in further detail below.
<br/><br/> Each user account may be associated with at least one user.  An account may be associated with an individual or group.  Moreover, a sub-account of one individual may be linked to a master account (e.g., parent account) of another individual (or
group of individuals).  In this manner, an account may be associated with a child, as well as a parent of the child.  Similarly, partner accounts may be linked to one another, enabling a partner account to control the account lifecycle of another partner
account.
<br/><br/> A user account may pertain to goods or services provided to the user and/or goods or services that are available to the user.  More particularly, the user account may indicate an amount of the goods or services provided to the user during a
period of time and/or an amount charged to the user for the goods or services provided to the user during the period of time.  In addition, the user account may indicate an amount of goods or services available to the user.  For example the user account
may indicate an amount of cell phone time that is available to the user via their mobile phone services provider.  The user account may be managed by a company that provides goods or services to the user or another entity such as an Internet Services
Provider.
<br/><br/> A request may initiate the performance of a set of one or more actions with respect to an account.  For example, an account may be accessed (e.g., queried), created, updated, suspended, activated, deactivated, or deleted in response to a
request.  A request may be one of a number of types of requests.  Example request types include, but are not limited to, an access request indicating a request to obtain or otherwise view information from an account, a create request indicating a request
to create an account, an update request indicating a request to update an account, a suspend request indicating a request to suspend an account, an activate request indicating a request to activate an account (e.g., from an inactive status to an active
status), a deactivate request indicating a request to deactivate an account to an inactive status, and a delete request indicating a request to delete an account.  For instance, a suspend request may be sent in response to abusive or inappropriate
activity by the user of the user account.  The server(s) 102 may receive a request and process the request, as will be described in further detail below.
<br/><br/> A request may be generated by the system in response to a trigger such as a particular online activity of the user or a complaint pertaining to the user that has been received from another individual or user.  Alternatively, a request may be
submitted by a user associated with the account or a user of another account (e.g., master account) linked to the account.  Moreover, a request may be submitted by an owner of the account, an individual employed by the owner of the account, or an
individual employed by a company or web site providing access to the account.
<br/><br/> Upon performing the set of actions in response to a particular request, the account information for the user account may be queried and/or modified accordingly.  More particularly, account information associated with the user account that is
retained in the data stores 118 may be queried, stored, deleted, updated, or otherwise modified.  For example, the account information may indicate that a particular request has been received and processed.  As another example, the account information
may indicate a change in status of the account (e.g., from active to suspended).
<br/><br/> The account information retained in the data stores 118 may include personal information such as demographic information (e.g., age and/or gender) and/or geographic information (e.g., residence address, work address, and/or zip code).  Moreover,
the account information may include financial information such as credit card information, enabling goods or services provided in association with the account to be purchased.  In addition, the account information may include information pertaining to
goods or services available to the user via the user account or used by the user.  More particularly, the account information may indicate an amount and/or quality of the goods or services available to the user or used by the user.  In addition, the
account information may indicate a cost associated with the amount and/or quality of goods or services available to the user or used by the user.
<br/><br/> The account information may also include or be linked to additional information pertaining to the user.  For example, the server(s) 102 may have access to additional user information stored in the data stores 118.  For example, user information
may be retained in one or more user logs.  This user information or a portion thereof may be referred to as a user profile.  More particularly, the user profile may include public information that is available in a public profile and/or private
information.  Furthermore, the user profile may include information that has been submitted by the user and/or information that has been deduced or automatically collected by the system (e.g., based upon user action(s)).  The user logs 118 may be
retained in one or more memories that are coupled to the server 102.
<br/><br/> The user information retained in the user logs 118 may include personal information such as demographic information (e.g., age and/or gender) and/or geographic information (e.g., residence address, work address, and/or zip code).  In addition,
each time a user performs online activities such as clicking on an advertisement, purchasing goods or services, posting information or content (e.g., on a web site or within the user's public profile), or annotating content, information regarding such
activity or activities may be retained as user data in the user logs 118.  For instance, the user data that is retained in the user logs 118 may indicate the identity of web sites visited, identity of ads that have been selected (e.g., clicked on) and/or
a timestamp.  Moreover, where the online publisher supports a search engine (e.g., via the server 102 or a separate search server), information associated with a search query, such as search term(s) of the search query, information indicating
characteristics of search results that have been selected (e.g., clicked on) by the user, and/or associated timestamp may also be retained in the user logs 118.  A user may be identified in the user logs 118 by a user ID (e.g., user account ID),
information in a user cookie, etc.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, as an individual interacts with a software application, e.g., an instant messenger or electronic mail application, descriptive content such as, for example, an email address, instant messenger identifier, phone number, postal
address, message content, date, time, etc., may be identified and stored.  Descriptive content may be stored along with contextual content.  For example, how a phone number came to be identified (e.g., it was contained in a communication received from
another via an instant messenger application) may be stored as contextual content associated with the phone number.  Contextual content, therefore, may identify circumstances surrounding receipt of a phone number (e.g., date or time the phone number was
received) and may be associated with descriptive content.  Contextual content, may, for example, be used to subsequently search for associated descriptive content.  For example, a search for phone numbers received from specific individuals, received via
an instant messenger application or at a given date or time, may be initiated.
<br/><br/> Content within a repository of media or multimedia, for example, may be annotated.  Examples of content may include text, images, audio, video, or the like, which may be processed or stored in memory.  Content may be contained within an object,
such as a Web object, Web page, Web site, electronic document, or the like.  An item in a collection of content may be referred to as an "item of content" or a "content item," and may be retrieved from a "Web of Objects" comprising objects made up of a
variety of types of content.  The term "annotation," as used herein, refers to descriptive or contextual content related to a content item, for example, collected from an individual, such as a user, and stored in association with the individual or the
content item.  Annotations may include various fields of descriptive content, such as a rating of a document, a list of keywords identifying topics of a document, etc.
<br/><br/> A profile builder may initiate generation of a profile, such as for users of an application, including a search engine, for example.  A profile builder may initiate generation of a user profile for use, for example, by a user, as well as by an
entity that may have provided the application.  For example, a profile builder may enhance relevance determinations and thereby assist in indexing, searching or ranking search results.  Therefore, a search engine provider may employ a profile builder,
for example.
<br/><br/> A variety of mechanisms may be implemented to generate a profile including, but not limited to, collecting or mining navigation history, stored documents, tags, or annotations, to provide a few examples.  A profile builder may store a generated
profile.  Through the use of user profiles of a search engine, for example, a search engine provider may to retrieve annotations, tags, stored pages, navigation history, or the like, which may be useful for making relevance determinations of search
results, such as with respect to a particular user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a process flow diagram illustrating an example method of processing a request in accordance with various embodiments.  An indication of a request pertaining to a user account may be obtained at 202, where the user account is associated
with at least one user.  More particularly, the indication of the request may be obtained in the form of a request message or another mechanism.  As set forth above, the request may be generated in response to a trigger such as a particular online
activity of the user or a complaint pertaining to the user that has been received from another individual or user.  Alternatively, the request may be submitted by a user associated with the account or a user of another account (e.g., master account)
linked to the account.  Moreover, a request may be submitted by an owner of the account, an individual employed by the owner of the account, or an individual employed by a company or web site providing access to the account.  Similarly, the request may
be submitted by an individual employed by a company providing goods or services to the user in association with the account.
<br/><br/> An account type of the user account may be determined at 204, where the account type is one of two or more account types.  Example account types include, but are not limited to, a simple account (e.g., independent account), a complex account
(e.g., an account that depends upon another account or that has a lifecycle that depends upon another account), a paid account, a free account, a partner account, a master account (e.g., parent account), a sub-account, an inactive account, or an abusive
account.
<br/><br/> One or more actions indicated by the request may be performed at 206 based, at least in part, upon the account type and/or a request type of the request.  More particularly, the action(s) to be performed may be identified based, at least in
part, upon the account type.  In addition, the action(s) to be performed may be further identified based, at least in part, upon the request type, other information in the request, account information pertaining to the account such as the state of the
account, and/or other information such as user information pertaining to the user.  Account information pertaining to the account may be retrieved from the master account database.
<br/><br/> The actions may be scheduled such that each of the actions is scheduled to occur at a corresponding time.  The actions may then be performed in accordance with the scheduled times.  For example, each of the actions may be performed at or after
the scheduled times.
<br/><br/> In addition, the actions may include a plurality of actions that correspond to a plurality of states in a lifecycle.  For example, a suspend account request may corresponding to a first lifecycle, while a deactivate account request may
corresponding to a second lifecycle.  The plurality of actions may be performed in a particular order in accordance with the plurality of states of the lifecycle.  Therefore, the plurality of actions may be performed in a sequential order, which may be
indicated by the plurality of states of the lifecycle.
<br/><br/> The action(s) to be performed may be identified, scheduled, and/or performed by a request processing engine, scheduling engine, and/or storage engine that corresponds to the account type, request type, account state, and/or other information. 
In addition, information pertaining to the request and/or the actions may be stored in at least one queue or data store that corresponds to the account type, request type, account state, and/or other information.  The information may be stored in the
queue or data store at one or more steps during the processing of the request (e.g., to schedule or perform the action(s)).  Thus, the information that is stored in the queue or data store may be deleted during the processing of the request or after the
processing of the request is completed.  In addition, the information that is stored in the queue or data store may be stored upon completion of the processing of the request.  As a result, the information that is stored in the queue or data store may be
retained after the processing of the request is completed (e.g., after the action(s) have been performed).
<br/><br/> In accordance with various embodiments, one of two or more request processing engines, schedulers, storage engines, data stores and/or queues may be selected based, at least in part, upon the account type.  Moreover, one of two or more request
processing engines, schedulers, storage engines, data stores or queues may be selected based, at least in part, upon a request type of the request, a state of the account, and/or other information.  Information pertaining to the user account (e.g.,
account identifier or state of the account), the request and/or at least one of the one or more actions indicated by the request may be stored in the selected one of the two or more data stores or queues.  Similarly, the information in the selected data
store or queue may be updated, deleted, or queried.
<br/><br/> A first subset of the two or more data stores (or queues) may include or consist of one or more relational databases (e.g., SQL databases), while a second subset of the two or more data stores (or queues) may include one or more types of
databases that do not include a relational database (e.g., SQL database).  Thus, a data store may be selected from the first subset or the second subset based, at least in part, upon the account type, the request type, and/or the state of the account.
<br/><br/> In accordance with various embodiments, requests that involve more significant processing or querying may be processed, at least in part, using a relational database (e.g., SQL database).  Similarly, requests pertaining to particular account
types that involve significant processing or querying may be processed, at least in part, using a relational database.  More particularly, a relational database may link two or more different dependent accounts to one another.  Moreover, the relational
behavior of a relational database may support flexible scheduling of actions.  Thus, where a request pertains to an account type such as a complex account or a partner account, the data store may be selected from the first subset.  In other words, the
data store that is selected may be a relational database (e.g., SQL database).
<br/><br/> Similarly, requests that involve less processing or minimal querying may be processed, at least in part, using a database that is not a relational database (e.g., SQL database).  Thus, requests pertaining to particular account types that involve
minimal processing or querying may be processed using a relational database (e.g., SQL database).  For example, where a request pertains to an account type such as a simple account, the data store may be selected from the second subset.  In other words,
the data store that is selected may be a non-relational database (e.g., non-SQL database).
<br/><br/> A request processing system may support the processing of any number of account types and request types.  More particularly, each account type may have a different, corresponding set of request types that are available for processing.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating an example request processing system in which various embodiments may be implemented.  A requester may transmit or otherwise provide a request.  As set forth above, the requester may be an individual or a system
component.  As shown in FIG. 3, an indication of a request may be obtained by a network device 302.  For example, the network device 302 may receive a request message, or ascertain that a request has been received via a setting or another mechanism.  The
network device 302 may validate the request.
<br/><br/> The network device 302 may determine an account type of the user account to which the request pertains.  For example, the network device 302 may obtain an account identifier and/or account type from the request.  As another example, the network
device 302 may obtain an account identifier from the request and ascertain the account type corresponding to the account identifier from a master account database 304.  In addition, the network device 302 may determine, from the request, a request type
of the request.  The network device 302 may also access a master account database to ascertain a state of the user account.
<br/><br/> The network device 302 may implement dispatching logic that examines the type of the request, the type of the user account to which the request pertains, and/or the state of the user account.  Thus, the dispatching logic may dispatch or
otherwise process the request based, at least in part, upon the type of the user account to which the request pertains, the type of the request, and/or the state of the account to optimize the processing of the request.  Such optimization may include the
forwarding of the request or associated information to the appropriate request processing engine, scheduling engine, storage engine, database, and/or queue for processing.
<br/><br/> In accordance with various embodiments, the network device 302 may "translate" the request to a set of one or more actions based, at least in part, upon the account type, the request type, and/or the state of the account.  More particularly, the
request may be translated to a series of actions that correspond to states of a lifecycle that pertain to the account type, the request type, and/or the state of the account.  The set of actions may then be scheduled and/or performed, as set forth below.
<br/><br/> Each of the functional blocks 306, 308, 310 may correspond to a different account type and/or request type.  More particularly, each of the functional blocks 306, 308, 310 may correspond to a different request processing engine, scheduling
engine, and/or storage engine.  Moreover, each of the functional blocks 306, 308, 310 may correspond to a different set of one or more queues and/or one or more data stores.  Stated another way, each of the functional blocks 306, 308, 310 may access
and/or update an associated set of queues and/or data stores.  For example, the functional block 306 may correspond to one or more relational databases (e.g., SQL databases), while functional blocks 308 and 310 may correspond to one or more
non-relational databases.
<br/><br/> In accordance with various embodiments, the network device 302 may serve as a dispatcher of requests, and provide information pertaining to the set of actions for processing by the appropriate one of the functional blocks 306, 308, 310.  More
particularly, the network device 302 may provide information pertaining to the set of actions to the appropriate storage engine.  For example, the network device 302 may store information pertaining to the set of actions in the appropriate data store(s)
or queue(s) (e.g., corresponding to the selected storage engine).  This information may be stored, for example, in the form of one or more data store records or one or more queue entries.  This information may include an account identifier.  In addition,
the information may indicate an account type, a request type, the specific actions to be performed, and/or an order in which the actions are to be performed.  For example, the information may indicate a processing time corresponding to each of the
actions.  This may be desirable, for example, where a particular action is to be performed after a delay of a particular number of days or after a particular date and/or time.
<br/><br/> The functional blocks 306, 308, 310 may operate as request processors, schedulers, and/or storage engines, which may be implemented together or separately via one or more servers.  More particularly, upon receiving a notification of a new
request or corresponding set of actions, or otherwise detecting a new request or corresponding set of actions, the functional blocks 306, 308, 310 may operate as schedulers to determine, among a plurality of actions pertaining to one or more requests, a
next set of one or more actions to be performed.  This may be accomplished, for example, by sorting actions (e.g., entries) in the scheduler's queue(s) according to an order in which the actions are to be performed, and selecting a particular number of
the sorted actions.  As another example, the scheduler may query its data store(s) for actions that are to be performed within a particular time period (e.g., the next 10 minutes) and select a particular number of these actions.  In this manner, a
scheduler may identify a next set of actions that have matured to be processed.  In accordance with various embodiments, an action may be performed at or after a scheduled time is reached.
<br/><br/> Any of the schedulers 306, 308, 310 may provide information pertaining to a set of one or more actions to be performed to a second network device 312, which may operate as a listener.  More particularly, the second network device 312 may perform
the actions in the order in which they are scheduled and/or received from the schedulers 306, 308, 310.  In this manner, the second network device 312 may process actions corresponding to one or more requests in accordance with their associated
lifecycles.  As the schedulers 306, 308, 310 provide information pertaining a set of one or more actions to be performed to the second network device 312, the schedulers 306, 308, 310 may delete this information from their queue(s) or data store(s).  As
shown in this example, the schedulers 306, 308, 310 and their corresponding queue(s) or data store(s) may be decoupled from each other.  This allows simplicity in dependency and management of the account workflow system.
<br/><br/> As the actions are performed, the second network device 312 may update the master account database 304.  More particularly, the second network device 312 may update the master account database 304 to change a state of a user account from a first
state to a second state.  For example, the state of a user account may be changed from active to suspended.
<br/><br/>Example Embodiments
<br/><br/> FIG. 4A is a transaction flow diagram illustrating an example method of processing a request within a system such as that illustrated in FIG. 3 in accordance with various embodiments.  In this example, vertical lines correspond to a Requester
402, a Dispatcher 302, a Master Account Database 304, Data Store 1 406, Data Store 2 408, and a Data Store 3 410, as shown.  As shown a Requester 402 may generate an account request 412.  Upon detecting the account request, ascertain the type of the
account request 412.  In addition, the Dispatcher 302 may access the Master Account Database 304 to ascertain the account type of the user account to which the account request pertains and/or a state of the account, as shown at 414.  The Dispatcher 302
may then determine an ideal queue or data store based, at least in part, upon the account type of the user account, the request type, and/or the state of the account at 416.
<br/><br/> In accordance with various embodiments, information pertaining to a request and/or corresponding actions to be performed in association with a complex account may be stored in a relational database or SQL database.  In this example, if the
Dispatcher 302 determines at 418 that the account type of the user account is a complex account such as a partner account, the Dispatcher 302 may store information pertaining to the request and/or actions to be performed in association with the request
in Data Store 1 406 (e.g., a relational or SQL database).  Upon determining that the account type of the user account is not a complex account, the Dispatcher 302 may store information in the data store or queue that corresponds to the request type.  For
example, if the Dispatcher 302 determines at 420 that the request type is a deactivate account request, the Dispatcher 302 may store information pertaining to the request and/or actions to be performed in association with the request in Data Store 2 408
(e.g., a non-relational database or non-SQL database).  Similarly, if the Dispatcher 302 determines at 422 that the request type is a suspend account request (e.g., the user account is an abusive account), the Dispatcher 302 may store information
pertaining to the request and/or actions to be performed in association with the request in Data Store 3 410 (e.g., a non-relational database or non-SQL database).
<br/><br/> FIG. 4B is a process flow diagram illustrating an example method of processing an account request in accordance with various embodiments.  As described above, the Dispatcher 302 may select the optimal data store or queue based, at least in part,
upon the account type and/or the request type.  In this example, the Dispatcher 302 may first determine whether the account type is a complex account such as a partner account at 430.  If the account type is a complex account (e.g., partner account), the
Dispatcher 302 may store information pertaining to the request and/or action(s) to be performed in a first database 432, which may be a relational database such as a SQL database.  However, if the account type is not a complex account, the Dispatcher 302
may then examine the request type to select the optimum data store.  If the request type indicates that the request is a suspend request at 434, the Dispatcher may store information pertaining to the request and/or action(s) to be performed in a second
database 436.  If the request type indicates that the request is a deactivate request at 438, the Dispatcher may store information pertaining to the request and/or action(s) to be performed in a third database 440.  In this example, the second database
436 and third database 440 are non-relational (e.g., SQL) databases.  The disclosed embodiments support an account workflow system that can easily be modified or upgraded.  More particularly, different types of request processing engines, storage
engines, queues, and/or database(s) may be implemented to support different or new account type(s), request type(s), and/or lifecycle behavior.  Moreover, additional request processing engine(s), storage engine(s), queue(s) and/or database(s) may be
added to increase capacity and performance.  Accordingly, the disclosed processes may easily be modified to support the reduction, addition, or modification of the various system components.
<br/><br/> Network
<br/><br/> A network may couple devices so that communications may be exchanged, such as between a server and a client device or other types of devices, including between wireless devices coupled via a wireless network, for example.  A network may also
include mass storage, such as network attached storage (NAS), a storage area network (SAN), or other forms of computer or machine readable media, for example.  A network may include the Internet, one or more local area networks (LANs), one or more wide
area networks (WANs), wire-line type connections, wireless type connections, or any combination thereof.  Likewise, sub-networks, such as may employ differing architectures or may be compliant or compatible with differing protocols, may interoperate
within a larger network.  Various types of devices may, for example, be made available to provide an interoperable capability for differing architectures or protocols.  As one illustrative example, a router may provide a link between otherwise separate
and independent LANs.
<br/><br/> A communication link or channel may include, for example, analog telephone lines, such as a twisted wire pair, a coaxial cable, full or fractional digital lines including T1, T2, T3, or T4 type lines, Integrated Services Digital Networks
(ISDNs), Digital Subscriber Lines (DSLs), wireless links including satellite links, or other communication links or channels, such as may be known to those skilled in the art.  Furthermore, a computing device or other related electronic devices may be
remotely coupled to a network, such as via a telephone line or link, for example.
<br/><br/> Content Distribution Network
<br/><br/> A distributed system may include a content distribution network.  A "content delivery network" or "content distribution network" (CDN) generally refers to a distributed content delivery system that comprises a collection of computers or
computing devices linked by a network or networks.  A CDN may employ software, systems, protocols or techniques to facilitate various services, such as storage, caching, communication of content, or streaming media or applications.  Services may also
make use of ancillary technologies including, but not limited to, "cloud computing," distributed storage, DNS request handling, provisioning, signal monitoring and reporting, content targeting, personalization, or business intelligence.  A CDN may also
enable an entity to operate or manage another's site infrastructure, in whole or in part.
<br/><br/> Peer-to-Peer Network
<br/><br/> A peer-to-peer (or P2P) network may employ computing power or bandwidth of network participants in contrast with a network that may employ dedicated devices, such as dedicated servers, for example; however, some networks may employ both as well
as other approaches.  A P2P network may typically be used for coupling nodes via an ad hoc arrangement or configuration.  A peer-to-peer network may employ some nodes capable of operating as both a "client" and a "server."
<br/><br/> Wireless Network
<br/><br/> A wireless network may couple client devices with a network.  A wireless network may employ stand-alone ad-hoc networks, mesh networks, Wireless LAN (WLAN) networks, cellular networks, or the like.
<br/><br/> A wireless network may further include a system of terminals, gateways, routers, or the like coupled by wireless radio links, or the like, which may move freely, randomly or organize themselves arbitrarily, such that network topology may change,
at times even rapidly.  A wireless network may further employ a plurality of network access technologies, including Long Term Evolution (LTE), WLAN, Wireless Router (WR) mesh, or 2nd, 3rd, or 4th generation (2G, 3G, or 4G) cellular technology, or the
like.  Network access technologies may enable wide area coverage for devices, such as client devices with varying degrees of mobility, for example.
<br/><br/> For example, a network may enable RF or wireless type communication via one or more network access technologies, such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), General Packet Radio
Services (GPRS), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), LTE Advanced, Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), Bluetooth, 802.11b/g/n, or the like.  A wireless network may include virtually any type of wireless
communication mechanism by which signals may be communicated between devices, such as a client device or a computing device, between or within a network, or the like.
<br/><br/> Internet Protocol
<br/><br/> Signal packets communicated via a network, such as a network of participating digital communication networks, may be compatible with or compliant with one or more protocols.  Signaling formats or protocols employed may include, for example,
TCP/IP, UDP, DECnet, NetBEUI, IPX, Appletalk, or the like.  Versions of the Internet Protocol (IP) may include IPv4 or IPv6.
<br/><br/> The Internet refers to a decentralized global network of networks.  The Internet includes LANs, WANs, wireless networks, or long haul public networks that, for example, allow signal packets to be communicated between LANs.  Signal packets may be
communicated between nodes of a network, such as, for example, to one or more sites employing a local network address.  A signal packet may, for example, be communicated over the Internet from a user site via an access node coupled to the Internet. 
Likewise, a signal packet may be forwarded via network nodes to a target site coupled to the network via a network access node, for example.  A signal packet communicated via the Internet may, for example, be routed via a path of gateways, servers, etc.
that may route the signal packet in accordance with a target address and availability of a network path to the target address.
<br/><br/> Social Network
<br/><br/> The term "social network" refers generally to a network of individuals, such as acquaintances, friends, family, colleagues, or co-workers, coupled via a communications network or via a variety of sub-networks.  Potentially, additional
relationships may subsequently be formed as a result of social interaction via the communications network or sub-networks.  A social network may be employed, for example, to identify additional connections for a variety of activities, including, but not
limited to, dating, job networking, receiving or providing service referrals, content sharing, creating new associations, maintaining existing associations, identifying potential activity partners, performing or supporting commercial transactions, or the
like.
<br/><br/> A social network may include individuals with similar experiences, opinions, education levels or backgrounds.  Subgroups may exist or be created according to user profiles of individuals, for example, in which a subgroup member may belong to
multiple subgroups.  An individual may also have multiple "1:few" associations within a social network, such as for family, college classmates, or co-workers.
<br/><br/> An individual's social network may refer to a set of direct personal relationships or a set of indirect personal relationships.  A direct personal relationship refers to a relationship for an individual in which communications may be individual
to individual, such as with family members, friends, colleagues, co-workers, or the like.  An indirect personal relationship refers to a relationship that may be available to an individual with another individual although no form of individual to
individual communication may have taken place, such as a friend of a friend, or the like.  Different privileges or permissions may be associated with relationships in a social network.  A social network also may generate relationships or connections with
entities other than a person, such as companies, brands, or so called `virtual persons.` An individual's social network may be represented in a variety of forms, such as visually, electronically or functionally.  For example, a "social graph" or
"socio-gram" may represent an entity in a social network as a node and a relationship as an edge or a link.
<br/><br/> Multi-Modal Communication (MMC)
<br/><br/> Individuals within one or more social networks may interact or communicate with other members of a social network via a variety of devices.  Multi-modal communication technologies refers to a set of technologies that permit interoperable
communication across multiple devices or platforms, such as cellphones, smart phones, tablet computing devices, personal computers, televisions, SMS/MMS, email, instant messenger clients, forums, social networking sites (such as <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, or
Google), or the like.

<br/><br/> The client device 600 may send or receive signals via one or more interface(s).  As shown in this example, the client device 600 may include one or more network interfaces 650.  The client device 600 may include an audio interface 652.  In
addition, the client device 600 may include a display 654 and an illuminator 658.  The client device 600 may further include an Input/Output interface 660, as well as a Haptic Interface 662 supporting tactile feedback technology.
<br/><br/> The client device 600 may vary in terms of capabilities or features.  Claimed subject matter is intended to cover a wide range of potential variations.  For example, a cell phone may include a keypad such 656 such as a numeric keypad or a
display of limited functionality, such as a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD) for displaying text.  In contrast, however, as another example, a web-enabled client device may include one or more physical or virtual keyboards, mass storage, one or
more accelerometers, one or more gyroscopes, global positioning system (GPS) 664 or other location identifying type capability, or a display with a high degree of functionality, such as a touch-sensitive color 2D or 3D display, for example.  The
foregoing is provided to illustrate that claimed subject matter is intended to include a wide range of possible features or capabilities.
<br/><br/> According to various embodiments, input may be obtained using a wide variety of techniques.  For example, input for downloading or launching an application may be obtained via a graphical user interface from a user's interaction with a local
application such as a mobile application on a mobile device, web site or web-based application or service and may be accomplished using any of a variety of well-known mechanisms for obtaining information from a user.  However, it should be understood
that such methods of obtaining input from a user are merely examples and that input may be obtained in many other ways.
<br/><br/> Regardless of the system's configuration, it may employ one or more memories or memory modules configured to store data, program instructions for the general-purpose processing operations and/or the inventive techniques described herein.  The
program instructions may control the operation of an operating system and/or one or more applications, for example.  The memory or memories may also be configured to store instructions for performing the disclosed methods, graphical user interfaces to be
displayed in association with the disclosed methods, etc.
<br/><br/> Because such information and program instructions may be employed to implement the systems/methods described herein, the disclosed embodiments relate to machine readable media that include program instructions, state information, etc. for
performing various operations described herein.  Examples of machine-readable media include, but are not limited to, magnetic media such as hard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical media such as CD-ROM disks; magneto-optical media such as
optical disks; and hardware devices that are specially configured to store and perform program instructions, such as ROM and RAM.  Examples of program instructions include both machine code, such as produced by a compiler, and files containing higher
level code that may be executed by the computer using an interpreter.
<br/><br/> Computer program instructions with which various embodiments are implemented may be stored in any type of computer-readable media, and may be executed according to a variety of computing models including a client/server model, a peer-to-peer
model, on a stand-alone computing device, or according to a distributed computing model in which various of the functionalities described herein may be effected or employed at different locations.
<br/><br/> The disclosed techniques may be implemented in any suitable combination of software and/or hardware system, such as a web-based server or desktop computer system.  Moreover, a system implementing various embodiments may be a portable device,
such as a laptop or cell phone.  An apparatus and/or web browser may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may be a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program and/or data structure stored in
the computer.  The processes presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus.  In particular, various general-purpose machines may be used with programs written in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may
be more convenient to construct a more specialized apparatus to perform the disclosed method steps.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 illustrates a typical computer system that, when appropriately configured or designed, can serve as a system via which various embodiments may be implemented.  The computer system 1200 includes any number of CPUs 1202 that are coupled to
storage devices including primary storage 1206 (typically a RAM), primary storage 1204 (typically a ROM).  CPU 1202 may be of various types including microcontrollers and microprocessors such as programmable devices (e.g., CPLDs and FPGAs) and
unprogrammable devices such as gate array ASICs or general purpose microprocessors.  As is well known in the art, primary storage 1204 acts to transfer data and instructions uni-directionally to the CPU and primary storage 1206 is used typically to
transfer data and instructions in a bi-directional manner.  Both of these primary storage devices may include any suitable computer-readable media such as those described above.  A mass storage device 1208 is also coupled bi-directionally to CPU 1202 and
provides additional data storage capacity and may include any of the computer-readable media described above.  Mass storage device 1208 may be used to store programs, data and the like and is typically a secondary storage medium such as a hard disk.  It
will be appreciated that the information retained within the mass storage device 1208, may, in appropriate cases, be incorporated in standard fashion as part of primary storage 1206 as virtual memory.  A specific mass storage device such as a CD-ROM 1214
may also pass data uni-directionally to the CPU.
<br/><br/> CPU 1202 may also be coupled to an interface 1210 that connects to one or more input/output devices such as such as video monitors, track balls, mice, keyboards, microphones, touch-sensitive displays, transducer card readers, magnetic or paper
tape readers, tablets, styluses, voice or handwriting recognizers, or other well-known input devices such as, of course, other computers.  Finally, CPU 1202 optionally may be coupled to an external device such as a database or a computer or
telecommunications network using an external connection as shown generally at 1212.  With such a connection, it is contemplated that the CPU might receive information from the network, or might output information to the network in the course of
performing the method steps described herein.
<br/><br/> Although the foregoing embodiments have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.  Therefore, the
present embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and are not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope and equivalents of the appended claims.
