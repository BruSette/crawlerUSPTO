       <p> A method begins by a processing module obtaining a set of identifiers
     (IDs) corresponding to a set of user devices, wherein each user device of
     the set of user devices is associated with a corresponding safety status
     level. For each identifier (ID) of the set of IDs, the method continues
     with the processing module generating a safety status request that
     includes the ID, outputting the safety status request to a user device of
     the set of user devices that corresponds to the ID, receiving a safety
     status response of a set of safety status responses, wherein the safety
     status response includes a corresponding safety status level of one user
     device of the set of user devices, and indicating the safety status level
     of the safety status response when an ID of the safety status response
     compares favorably to at least one ID of the set of IDs.

<br/><br/>INCORPORATION-BY-REFERENCE OF MATERIAL SUBMITTED ON A COMPACT DISC
<br/><br/> Not Applicable
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> 1.  Technical Field of the Invention
<br/><br/> This invention relates generally to computing systems and more particularly to emergency preparedness information processing within such computing systems.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of Related Art
<br/><br/> Emergencies are known to be associated with direct costs (e.g., rebuilding), indirect costs (e.g., higher insurance premiums,) and serious loss of life.  Such emergencies include man-made emergencies and natural disasters.  Examples of man-made
emergencies are known to include traffic accidents, structure fires, chemical spills, railroad accidents, aircraft accidents, shipping accidents, criminal activities, and terrorism.  Examples of natural disasters are known to include hurricanes,
typhoons, earthquakes, forest fires, mudslides, floods, droughts, dust storms, hail storms, extreme heat, extreme cold, and snow storms.
<br/><br/> Emergency management is known to address reducing the impact of emergencies by avoiding risks associated with emergencies and by utilizing more effective practices and tools to respond to emergencies.  Emergency management is known to partition
such management into phases including a mitigation phase (e.g., to reduce risks, to reduce the effects of disasters), a preparedness phase (e.g., planning, resourcing, drilling), a response phase (e.g., primary resource activation, secondary resource
activation), and a recovery phase (e.g., rebuilding).
<br/><br/> Emergency impact may be abated by improving the effectiveness of the preparedness phase.  For example, preparing a resource checklist that is relevant to a group of individuals and a particular emergency scenario may improve the effectiveness of
a subsequent response phase.  In another example, providing a training tutorial that is relevant to the group of individuals and the particular emergency scenario may also improve the effectiveness of the subsequent response phase.  In another example,
providing a training drill that is relevant to the group of individuals and the particular emergency scenario that utilizes resources from the resource checklist and process steps from the training tutorial may also improve the effectiveness of the
subsequent response phase.
<br/><br/> Emergency impact may be abated by improving the effectiveness of the response phase.  For example, effective communications between individuals and groups of individuals affected by (e.g., victims, including individuals, families, co-workers,
etc.) or responding to an emergency (e.g., first responders, second responders, aid workers, volunteers, individuals) may improve the effectiveness of the response phase.  In an instance, a first family member communicates with a second family member via
a cellular telephone with instructions including where to go for help.  In another instance, a second responders communicate with a volunteer indicating needed resources at the scene of an emergency.
<br/><br/> Computing systems are known to process data into information, store information and communicate information.  Such information may include emergency preparedness information and response phase communications information.  Individuals utilize
computing systems to gain access to such emergency preparedness information.  Despite such access, individuals may not always obtain desired or optimal emergency preparedness information due to complexities associated with a relevant emergency scenario,
resource gaps, chain of command, lack of training, and tension associated with emergency.  Individuals utilize public computing systems (e.g., the internet, wireless devices, wireless networks) to communicate response phase communications information
during an emergency.  Despite such utilization, public computing systems (e.g., a commercial wireless carrier network) typically can't sustain a demanded traffic volume of such response phase communications information when the demanded traffic volume is
multiples of a typical non-emergency time period.  In an instance, a cellular network may provide tens of voice call communications paths per cellular tower when hundreds of voice call resources are in demand.  One solution is to utilize text messaging
rather than voice telephony to carry out communication of the response phase communications information.  For example, hundreds of individuals can communicate via text messaging utilizing a similar cellular network channel resource that can only support
a single voice call.  Despite such texting capability, effective utilization of texting services is impacted by one more of identifying other users to communicate with, entering identifiers associated with the other users, and rapidly exchanging the
response phase communications information. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING(S)

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of a computing system 10 that includes a plurality of user devices 12, a wireless location network 14, a wireless communication network 16, an application server 18, a network 20, an
information server 22, and a remote application server 24.  The wireless location network 14 includes one or more of a public wireless location system (e.g., global positioning satellite (GPS), a cellular network) and one or more private wireless
location systems (e.g., wireless beacon, a wireless local area network (WLAN)).  The wireless location network 14 sends wireless location signals 26 to the plurality of user devices 12 to enable determination of location information.
<br/><br/> The wireless communications network 16 includes one or more of a public wireless communications system and a private wireless communications system and may operate in accordance with one or more wireless industry standards including universal
mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), long term evolution (LTE), wideband code division multiplexing (WCDMA), IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.16.  The wireless communication network 16 sends wireless communications
signals 28 to the plurality of user devices 12 and receives wireless communications signals 28 from the plurality of user devices 12 to communicate information and application messages 30.  Alternatively, or in addition to, the plurality of user devices
12 may send and receive the wireless communications signals 28 directly between two or more user devices 12 of the plurality of user devices 12.
<br/><br/> The application server 18 includes a processing module and memory to support execution of one or more applications (e.g., an emergency preparedness application).  The processing module may be a single processing device or a plurality of
processing devices.  Such a processing device may be implemented with one or more of a microprocessor, micro-controller, digital signal processor, microcomputer, central processing unit, field programmable gate array, programmable logic device, state
machine, logic circuitry, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or any device that manipulates signals (analog and/or digital) based on hard coding of the circuitry and/or operational instructions.  The processing module may have an associated memory
and/or memory element, which may be a single memory device, a plurality of memory devices, and/or embedded circuitry of the processing module.  The memory device may be a read-only memory, random access memory, volatile memory, non-volatile memory,
static memory, dynamic memory, flash memory, cache memory, and/or any device that stores digital information.  The processing devices may be centrally located (e.g., directly coupled together via a wired and/or wireless bus structure) when the processing
module includes more than one processing device, or may be distributedly located (e.g., cloud computing via indirect coupling via a local area network and/or a wide area network).  The memory and/or memory element storing the corresponding operational
instructions may be embedded within, or external to, the circuitry comprising the state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry when the processing module implements one or more of its functions via a state machine, analog
circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry.  The memory element stores hardcoded and/or operational instructions and the processing module executes the hardcoded and/or operational instructions corresponding to at least some of the steps and/or
functions illustrated in FIGS. 1-7.
<br/><br/> The network 20 may include one or more of wireless and/or wireline communications systems, one or more private communications systems, and a public internet system.  The application server 18 communicates information and application messages 30
via the wireless communication network 16 to the plurality of user devices 12 and via the network 20 to the information server 22 and the remote application server 24.  The information server 22 includes a processing module and memory to support storage
and retrieval of information (e.g., emergency preparedness information) via information messages 32.  For example, the information server 22 streams emergency preparedness information via the network 20 and the wireless communication network 16 to one or
more of the user devices 12.  As another example, information server 22 sends emergency preparedness information to user device 12 in response to receiving a request for emergency preparedness information from the user device 12.  The remote application
server 24 includes a processing module and memory to support execution of one or more applications (e.g., the emergency preparedness application).  For example, the remote application server 24 sends an application output response message as an
application message 34 to the user device 12 in response to receiving an application request as the application message 34 from the user device 12.
<br/><br/> The plurality of user devices 12 may be a portable computing device (e.g., a smart phone, a tablet computer, a laptop a handheld computer and/or any other portable device that includes a computing unit) and/or a fixed computing device (e.g., a
desktop computer, a cable television set-top box, an application server, an internet television user interface and/or any other fixed device that includes a computing unit).  Such a portable or fixed computing device includes one or more of a computing
unit (e.g., providing processing module functionality), one or more wireless modems, sensors, and one or more user interfaces.  An embodiment of the user device 12 will be described in greater detail with reference to FIG. 2.
<br/><br/> In general and with respect to emergency preparedness, the system 10 supports three primary functions: emergency preparedness planning, emergency preparedness drilling, and response phase emergency communications.  In accordance with these three
primary functions, emergency preparedness plans can be created that are relevant in relationship to likely emergency scenarios and those affected, the emergency preparedness plans can be exercised by way of drilling and training to enable more efficient
operations during an emergency response phase, and communications can be provided during an emergency response that is efficient in terms of mitigation resource utilization and relevant in terms of scope and nature of an associated emergency scenario.
<br/><br/> The first primary function includes the user device determining emergency preparedness planning information.  In an example of operation, the user device 12 determines location information based on receiving the wireless location signals 26. 
Next, the user device 12 sends a checklist request message that includes the location information to the application server 18 as wireless communications signals 28 via the wireless communications network 16.  The application server 18 determines
recommended checklists based on the location information to produce recommended checklists (e.g., a hurricane checklist, a tornado checklist, etc.).  For instance, the application server 18 determines the recommended checklists to include the hurricane
checklist and the tornado checklist when the location information indicates that the user device is located in central Florida.  As another instance, the application server 18 determines the recommended checklists to include an earthquake checklist and a
wildfire checklist when the location information indicates that the user device is located in Southern California.  The application server 18 sends the recommended checklists to the user device 12.  The user device 12 displays the recommended checklists
and receives user input to produce a selected checklist.  The user device 12 sends the selected checklist to the application server 18.  The application server 18 determines selected checklist information based on the selected checklist.  The application
server 18 sends the selected checklist information to the user device 12.  The user device 12 displays the selected checklist information and receives user input.  The user device 12 modifies checklist item availability status to produce modified
checklist item availability status.  The user device 12 stores the modified checklist item availability status and may send the modified checklist item availability status to the application server 18 and/or the information server 22.  In addition, the
user device 12 may produce a checklist item reminder (e.g., a visual and audible alert) in accordance with a checklist alert schedule when the modified checklist item availability status compares unfavorably to a checklist item availability template. 
The method of operation to determine emergency preparedness planning information is discussed in greater detail with reference to FIGS. 3-7.
<br/><br/> The second primary function includes the user device 12 participating in emergency preparedness drilling.  In an example of operation, the user device 12 obtains location information and other context information (e.g., including a drill
schedule) to produce a context bundle.  The user device 12 sends a drill request message to the remote application server 24 that includes the context bundle.  The remote application server 24 determines drill parameters (e.g., a drill scenario) and a
drill identifier (ID) based on the drill request message.  For instance, the remote application server 24 determines the drill scenario to be a hurricane drill based on the location information indicating that the user device 12 is near the Atlantic
Ocean.  As another instance, the remote application server 24 determines the drill scenario to be an earthquake drill based on the location information indicating that the user device 12 is near an earthquake fault line.  The remote application server 24
sends the drill parameters and the drill ID to the user device 12.  The remote application server 24 initializes a drill application associated with the drill ID and in accordance with the drill parameters.  The remote application server 24 sends a drill
update message to the user device 12 that includes drill application output associated with the drill application.  The user device 12 receives the drill update message and sends the drill application output to a display associated with the user device. 
The user device 12 receives user input to produce drill input information.  The user device 12 sends a drill input message to the remote application server 24 that includes the drill input information.  The remote application server 24 receives the drill
input message and provides the drill application with the drill input information to produce updated drill application output.  The remote application server 24 sends a second drill update message to the user device 12 that includes the updated drill
application output.  The process repeats until the application reaches an end point.  The method of operation to participate in drilling is discussed in greater detail with reference to FIGS. 3-7.
<br/><br/> The third primary function includes the user device 12 communicating during an emergency response phase.  In an example of operation, the user device 12 obtains location information and other context information (e.g., including a group ID
affiliation) to produce the context bundle.  The user device 12 obtains local status (e.g., ok, getting help, need help, etc.) via a user prompt.  Next, the user device 12 sends a status request message to the application server 18 that includes the
local status and the context bundle.  The application server 18 receives the status request message and determines a status associated with each user device 12 affiliated with the group ID.  For instance, the application server 18 sends a status request
message to the other user devices 12 affiliated with the group ID and receives status response messages indicating status.  The application server 18 sends a status response message that includes status information of the other user devices 12 affiliated
with the group ID to the user device.  The user device 12 receives the status response message and displays the status information in accordance with the context bundle.  For instance, the user device 12 displays names associated with the other user
devices 12 and utilizes a colored icon to indicate status of the other user device (e.g., red for not okay, green for okay).  As another instance, the user device 12 displays names associated with the other user devices in a rank ordered list where the
ranking is by relative distance away from the user device 12 as determined utilizing status information associated with the other user devices 12.  As another instance, the user device 12 displays the names associated with the other user devices 12 on a
map where in the center of the map is a location associated with the user device 12.  The method of operation to communicate is discussed in greater detail with reference to FIGS. 3-7.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of a user device 12 that includes a user interface output 40, a user interface input 42, a sensor 44, a computing unit 46, a wireless communications modem 48, and a wireless location modem 50.

The interface output device 40 may include one or more of a display, a touch screen, a speaker, an earpiece, a motor, an indicator light, a
transducer, and a digital indicator.  For instance, the interface output device 40 includes a color touch screen display capable of rendering static images and/or full-motion video.  The user interface input 42 may be a single interface input device or a
plurality of interface input devices.  The interface input device includes one or more of a touch screen sensor array, a keyboard, a microphone, a fingerprint reader, a trackball, a mouse sensor, a pushbutton, and a selector switch.  For instance, the
interface input device includes a touch screen sensor array associated with the color touch screen display.  The sensor 44 may be a single sensor device or a plurality of sensor devices.  The sensor device includes capabilities for sensing one or more of
a magnetic field (e.g., a compass), motion, temperature, pressure, altitude, humidity, an image, a stream of images (e.g., capture video), biometrics, proximity, capacitance, gases, radiation, pathogens, light levels, and bio hazards.
<br/><br/> The wireless communications modem 48 may include a single wireless transceiver or a plurality of wireless transceivers.  The wireless transceiver may operate in accordance with one or more wireless industry standards including universal mobile

wireless location receiver, a single wireless location transceiver, a plurality of wireless location receivers, and a plurality of wireless location transceivers.  The wireless location transceiver and wireless location transceiver may operate in
accordance with one or more wireless location technologies including GPS, WiFi, angle of arrival, time difference of arrival, signal strength, and beaconing.
<br/><br/> The computing unit 46 includes an application processing module 52, a memory 54 one or more interfaces to one or more of the user interface output 40, user interface input 42, the sensor 44, the wireless communication modem 48, and the wireless
location modem 50.  The memory 54 may include a single memory device or a plurality of memory devices.  The memory device may be a read-only memory, random access memory, volatile memory, non-volatile memory, cache memory, and/or any device that stores
digital information.  Memory device examples include static random access memory (SRAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), NAND flash memory, magnetic memory (e.g., a hard disk), and optical memory (e.g., an optical disc).
<br/><br/> The application processing module 52 may be a single processing device or a plurality of processing devices.  The processing device may include one or more of a microprocessor, micro-controller, digital signal processor, microcomputer, central
processing unit, field programmable gate array, programmable logic device, state machine, logic circuitry, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or any device that manipulates signals (analog and/or digital) based on hard coding of the circuitry
and/or operational instructions.  The application processing module 52 may have an associated memory and/or memory element, which may be a single memory device, a plurality of memory devices, and/or embedded circuitry of the application processing
module.
<br/><br/> The memory device 54 include one or more of a read-only memory, random access memory, volatile memory, non-volatile memory, static memory, dynamic memory, flash memory, cache memory, and/or any device that stores digital information.  The
processing devices may be centrally located (e.g., directly coupled together via a wired and/or wireless bus structure) when the application processing module includes more than one processing device, or the processing devices may be distributedly
located (e.g., cloud computing via indirect coupling via a local area network and/or a wide area network).  The memory and/or memory element storing the corresponding operational instructions may be embedded within, or external to, the circuitry
comprising the state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry) when the application processing module implements one or more of its functions via a state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry. 
The memory element stores hard coded and/or operational instructions and the application processing module executes the hard coded and/or operational instructions corresponding to at least some of the steps and/or functions illustrated in FIGS. 3-7.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating an example of acquiring safety status information associated with a set of user devices.  The method begins at step 60 where a processing module (e.g., of a requesting entity) obtains a set of identifiers (IDs)
corresponding to a set of user devices.  Each user device of the set of user devices is associated with a corresponding safety status level.  The set of identifiers includes at least one of at least one mobile phone number corresponding to at least one
user device, at least one user device serial number corresponding to the at least one user device, at least one user device media access control (MAC) address corresponding to the at least one user device, at least one user internet protocol (IP) address
corresponding to the at least one user device, at least one user device international mobile equipment identities (IMEI) corresponding to the at least one user device, at least one variable ID corresponding to the at least one user device, at least one
assignable ID corresponding to the at least one user device, at least one social network contact name corresponding to the least one user device, and at least one user name corresponding to the at least one user device.
<br/><br/> The safety status level includes at least one of a safety status level text string generated by a user device (e.g., safe/not safe), a safety status text string generated by the one user device (e.g., I'm at the mall, send help), location
information generated by the one user device (e.g., global positioning satellite (GPS) coordinates, an address, a location description), a timestamp corresponding to when the social network server received the safety status response, a timestamp
corresponding to when the one user device generated the safety status response, and a timestamp corresponding to when the safety status response was received.
<br/><br/> The obtaining the set of IDs corresponding to the set of user devices includes at least one of a variety of approaches.  In a first approach, the processing module retrieves the set of IDs from a list.  In a second approach, the processing
module outputs a query and receives a response.  In a third approach, the processing module accesses a group affiliation.  A group affiliation includes a commonality factor amongst a group of users of a group of user devices.  The commonality factor
includes one or more of a common neighborhood, common family members, common friends, common coworkers, common classmates, common club members, common social networking friends, common interests, common questions, and common web browser history.
<br/><br/> In a fourth approach of obtaining the set of IDs, the processing module obtains the set of IDs from social networking information associated with at least one user device of the set of user devices.  The social networking information includes
one or more of a life social networking stream, content of one or more social networking postings, social networking registration information, social networking substructure information, purchases associated with social networking, purchasers associated
with social networking, a friend identifier, a friend of a friend identifier, and a new friend entry.  For example, the processing module obtains one or more IDs of the set of IDs from a live social networking stream (e.g., Twitter).  As another example,
the processing module obtains one or more IDs of the set of IDs from a social networking subscriber list (e.g., a <b><i>Facebook</i></b> friend list).
<br/><br/> In a fifth approach of obtaining the set of IDs, the processing module receives the set of IDs (e.g., from another associated user device, from a social network and server).  In a sixth approach, the processing module obtains a user selection of
the set of IDs.  The obtaining the user selection of the set of IDs includes a sequence of steps.  In a first step, the processing module indicates a group of usernames corresponding to a group of user devices.  In a second step, the processing module
obtains a set of username selections from the group of usernames.  In a third step, for each username, the processing module obtains an ID associated with the username when the username is associated with a mobile phone number and updates the set of IDs
to include the ID.  For example, the processing module receives the user selection from a user interface input.
<br/><br/> As an example of obtaining the set of IDs, the processing module displays a prompt, wherein the prompt includes a portion of a contact list, and receives a selection of "Sally" via a user device input corresponding to a contact of the contact
list.  As another example, the processing module obtains a contact "Bob" when a location indicator indicates that a user device associated with Bob is within a proximal range of the requesting entity.  As yet another example, the processing module
obtains a contact "George" when a timestamp indicates 6 pm and a selection schedule lookup indicates that the contact George is to be obtained after 6 PM on a daily basis.  As a further example, the processing module obtains a contact "Christopher" when
a location indicator associated with the processing module indicates that a user device associated with the processing module is within a proximal distance to a high crime area and a table lookup indicates to add Christopher whenever the user device is
within a proximal distance to a high crime area.
<br/><br/> For each identifier (ID) of the set of IDs, the method continues at step 62 where the processing module generates a safety status request that includes the ID.  The generating the safety status request includes generating at least one of an
instant message, a short message service (SMS) message, an email message, and a data message.  When generating the at least one of the instant message, the SMS message, the email message, and the data message, the processing module generates the at least
one of the instant message, the SMS message, the email message, and the data message to include at least one of the ID, a mobile phone number corresponding to the ID, the set of IDs, a requesting entity ID, a social networking posting request (e.g., a
most recent posting, a set of postings, a posting pertaining to a search term and/or cloud tag), a safety status request code, and a safety status request text string (e.g., "please respond to this message with your current status").  For example, the
processing module generates a safety status request to include ID 312-555-1234 of the set of IDs, requesting entity ID 312-555-4321, and a status request code text string of "please respond to this message with your current status."
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 64 where the processing module outputs the safety status request to a user device of the set of user devices that corresponds to the ID.  The outputting the safety status request to the user device includes the
processing module facilitating at least one of a variety of approaches.  In a first approach, the processing module facilitates transmitting the safety status request on a control channel of a wireless communication network (e.g., as a wireless
communication signal).  In a second approach, the processing module facilitates transmitting the safety status request on a data channel of the wireless communication network (e.g., as the wireless communication signal).  In a third approach, the
processing module facilitates transmitting the safety status request directly to the user device utilizing the wireless communication signals.  In a fourth approach, the processing module facilitates sending the safety status request to the user device
via at least one of the wireless communication network and a wireline communication network (e.g., internet, telephony network, fiber, cable, twisted-pair, local area network, wide area network.  In a fifth approach, the processing module facilitates
sending the safety status request to an application server via at least one of the wireless communication network and the wireline communication network.  In a six approach, the processing module facilitates sending the safety status request to a social
network server.
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 66 where the processing module receives a safety status response of a set of safety status responses.  The safety status response includes a corresponding safety status level of one user device of the set of user
devices.  The receiving the safety status response includes a processing module facilitating at least one of a variety of approaches.  In a first approach, the processing module facilitates receiving the safety status response on the control channel of
the wireless communication network.  In a second approach, the processing module facilitates receiving the safety status response on the data channel of the wireless communication network.  In a third approach, the processing module facilitates receiving
the safety status response from the social network server.  In a fourth approach, the processing module facilitates receiving the safety status response from the one user device via at least one of the wireless communication network and the wireline
communication network.  In a fifth approach, the processing module facilitates receiving the safety status response from the application server via at least one of the wireless communication network and the wireline communication network.
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 68 where the processing module indicates the safety status level of the safety status response when an ID of the safety status response compares favorably to at least one ID of the set of IDs.  For example, the
processing module determines that a contact selection is associated with a mobile ID when the processing module accesses a contact list entry corresponding to the contact selection of "Sally" and accesses the mobile ID field that includes a mobile phone
number corresponding to Sally.  The indicating the safety status level of the safety status response includes at least one of a variety of approaches.  In the first approach, the processing module identifies the safety status level of the safety status
response when the ID of the safety status response compares favorably to the at least one ID of the set of IDs.  In a second approach, the processing module interprets the safety status level text string to produce a safety status condition (e.g.,
safe/not safe).  In a third approach, the processing module selects an indicator icon based at least one of the safety status level and the safety status condition (e.g., a red X corresponding to a not safe safety status condition, a green dot
corresponding to a safe safety status condition).
<br/><br/> In a fourth approach of indicating the safety status level of the safety status response, the processing module facilitates displaying of one or more of the safety status level, the safety status condition, the indicator icon, the safety status
level text string, the location information, and the timestamp (e.g., displaying includes visual and/or audible, along with other social network info).  For example, the processing module displays a username of "John" that corresponds to the user device
of ID 312-555-1234, a text message of "safe, at home", location information of an address of 111 W. Main St, Home Town, Calif., and a timestamp of 2011-07-30 19:36:22 GMT+0.  As another example, the processing module displays a username of "Michelle"
that corresponds to a user device of ID 312-555-1222, a text message of "not safe, in storm path, need a pick up at school", location information of an address of 326 W. First St, Home Town, Calif., and a timestamp of 2011-07-30 19:37:52 GMT+0.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example of providing safety status information.  The method begins at step 70 where a processing module (e.g., of a responding user device, of an application server, of a social network server) receives a
safety status request for a safety status level associated with a user device.  The safety status level includes at least one of a safety status level text string generated by the user device, a safety status text string generated by the user device, a
safety status text string generated by the social network server (e.g., interpreting one or more postings), location information associated with the user device, a timestamp corresponding to generation of the safety status response, and a timestamp
estimate corresponding to when the safety status response is expected to be received (e.g., received by a requesting entity, received by the social network server).
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 72 where the processing module determines whether to generate a safety status response.  The determining whether to generate the safety status response includes a sequence of steps.  In a first step, the processing
module identifies allowable requesting entities based on at least one of a social network contact list, social network sub-contact list (e.g., friends list), a group affiliation, a social network information stream (e.g., Twitter feed, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> message),
accessing an auto-respond to all requesters indicator, accessing an allowable requesting entity list, accessing a set of identifiers (IDs) corresponding to a set of user devices associated with the user device, and receiving a user input.  In a second
step to generate the safety status response, the processing module determines to generate the safety status response when a requesting entity identifier of the safety status request compares favorably to the identified allowable requesting entities
(e.g., auto-respond to all requesters indicator indicates to enable auto-respond to all requesters, the requesting entity ID is substantially the same as an ID of one of the identified allowable requesting entities).
<br/><br/> When generating a safety status response, the method continues at step 74 where the processing module obtains the safety status level associated with the user device.  The obtaining the safety status level associated with the user device
includes at least one of a variety of approaches.  A first approach includes querying social network server.  A second approach includes accessing a predetermined safety status level (e.g., pre-stored by a user of the user device).  A third approach
includes querying the user device.  A fourth approach includes receiving the safety status level from the user device.  A fifth approach includes receiving a safe/not-safe indicator.  A sixth approach includes receiving a safety status text string
associated with the safety status level.  A seventh approach includes generating the safety status text string based on the location schedule (e.g. scheduled to be at school, a schedule adherence deviation indicator).  An eighth approach includes
interpreting a schedule adherence deviation indicator (e.g., string indicates Johnny is not at school when a calendar indicates that Johnny should be at school and a current location indicates that Johnny is not at school).  A ninth approach includes
obtaining a user input.  A 10th approach includes obtaining accelerometer information associated with the user device (e.g. speed, acceleration, movement versus time, speed exceeds a posted speed limit).  An 11th approach includes obtaining a picture
associated with the user device (e.g. from current location, always or only when not safe).
<br/><br/> A 12th approach to obtain the safety status level associated with the user device includes receiving at least one of a radio frequency identifier (RFID), a near field communication (NFC) signal, and a barcode scanner value.  A 13th approach
includes obtaining a timestamp.  A 14th approach includes obtaining geographic location alert information with regards to a comparison of a real-time geographic location to a predetermined geographic location (e.g. geo-fence).  A 15th approach includes
generating a safety status level text string to include a not-safe indication when the comparison of the real-time geographic location to the predetermined geographic location is unfavorable (e.g. outside of the geo-fence).  A 16th approach includes
generating the safety status level text string to include the not-safe indication when a comparison of the real-time geographic location to a geographic location associated with the safety status text string is unfavorable (e.g. schedule is to be at
school but real-time location is not at school).
<br/><br/> As an example of obtaining the safety status level, the processing module retrieves the predetermined safety status level indicating a text string of "safe, at home." As another example, the processing module receives a user input text string of
"not safe, can't start my car at the mall." As yet another example, the processing module retrieves a user device camera sensor picture file when a current location indicator indicates an unfavorable location (e.g., a variation from adherence to a
schedule, outside of a geo-fence, within a known area of concern, within a forecasted storm path).  Alternatively, or in addition to, the processing module may display the user device safety status level via a user interface output.
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 76 where the processing module determines whether to include location information in the safety status response.  The determining whether to include the location information in the safety status response includes at
least one of a variety of alternatives.  A first alternative includes receiving a user input.  A second alternative includes querying a social network server.  A third alternative includes receiving a request for location information from a member of a
social network group, wherein the user device is affiliated with the social network group.  A fourth alternative includes interpreting a schedule adherence deviation indicator (e.g., include location information when the deviation indicator indicates a
deviation).  A fifth alternative includes obtaining a user preference with regards to including the location information in the safety status response (e.g., privacy setting).  A sixth alternative includes indicating to include location information in
the safety status response when the safety status request includes an indicator to always include the location information in the safety status response.  The method branches to step 82 when the processing module determines to include the location
information in the safety status response.  The method continues to step 78 when the processing module determines not to include location information in the safety status response.  When not including the location information, the method continues at
step 78 where the processing module generates the safety status response to include the safety status level.  The method branches to step 90.
<br/><br/> When including the location information, the method continues at step 82 where the processing module obtains location coordinates corresponding to the user device.  The location coordinates includes at least one of a longitude value, a latitude
value, an elevation value, a speed value, an acceleration value, and a location quality indicator.  The obtaining location coordinates corresponding to the user device includes at least one of a variety of approaches.  A first approach includes receiving
the location coordinates from at least one location sensor associated with the user device (e.g., accelerometer, electronic compass, global positioning system (GPS) receiver).  A second approach includes receiving the location coordinates from a wireless
location modem associated with the user device (e.g., time of arrival receiver, cell site, time difference of arrival, signal strength, angle of arrival, GPS receiver, WiFi site ID, etc.).  A third approach includes querying the user device to obtain the
location coordinates (e.g., from a server).  A fourth approach includes querying an internet protocol (IP) address to location coordinates table based on an identified IP address (e.g., IP address associated with user device).  A fifth approach includes
querying a social network server to obtain the location coordinates.  A sixth approach includes accessing last known location coordinates when a location quality level associated with the location coordinates compares unfavorably to a location quality
level threshold (e.g., location coordinates unobtainable, location coordinates too old, location coordinates not accurate enough, indoor location unknown).
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 84 where the processing module obtains street address location information based on the location coordinates.  The obtaining the street address location information includes at least one of a variety of alternatives. A first alternative includes accessing a location coordinates to street address location table based on the location coordinates to produce the street address location information.  A second alternative includes querying a location server based on the
location coordinates.  A third alternative includes querying another user device associated with a social network group, wherein the social network group includes the user device.  A fourth alternative includes accessing an internet protocol (IP) address
to street address location table utilizing an identified IP address (e.g., an IP address associated with user device).  A fifth alternative includes accessing a wireless communication network access device identifier (ID) to street address location table
utilizing an identified wireless communication network access device ID.  A sixth alternative includes receiving the street address location information from the location server.  A seventh alternative includes accessing a last known street address
location when a location quality level associated with the location coordinates compares unfavorably to a location quality level threshold.
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 86 where the processing module generates the location information based on the location coordinates and the street address location information.  For example, the processing module generates the location information
to include the location coordinates and the street address location information.  As another example, the processing module generates a web link to a location server that includes the location coordinates and includes a web link in the location
information.  The web link may be subsequently utilized by a requesting entity to retrieve a geographic map representing a location of the user device.
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 88 where the processing module generates the safety status response to include the safety status level and the location information.  The generating the safety status response includes generating at least one of an
instant message, a short message service (SMS) message, an email message, and a data message.  When generating the at least one of the instant message, the SMS message, the email message, and the data message, the processing module generates the at least
one of the instant message, the SMS message, the email message, and the data message to include at least one of a mobile phone number corresponding to the user device, an identifier associated with the user device, a social networking posting associated
with the user device, a requesting entity ID associated with the requesting entity, the safety status level, a timestamp corresponding to transmission of the safety status response, the location information, and a safety status response code.
<br/><br/> A method continues at step 90 where the processing module outputs the safety status response to the requesting entity.  The outputting the safety status response to the requesting entity includes a processing module facilitating at least one of
a variety of approaches.  A first approach includes transmitting the safety status response on a control channel of a wireless communication network.  A second approach includes transmitting the safety status response on a data channel of the wireless
communication network.  A third approach includes outputting the safety status response to a social network server for distribution (e.g., to the requesting entity or others in a social networking group).  A fourth approach includes transmitting the
safety status response to the requesting entity via at least one of the wireless communication network and the wireline communication network.  A fifth approach includes transmitting the safety status response to an application server via at least one of
the wireless communication network and the wireline communication network.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an example of obtaining alert information, which includes similar steps to FIG. 4.  The method begins with step 82 of FIG. 4 where a processing module (e.g., of a user device) obtains location coordinates.  The
location coordinates includes at least one of current location coordinates and last known location coordinates when current location coordinates are not available.  The method continues at step 94 where the processing module obtains a geographic
designator based on the location coordinates.  The geographic designator includes at least one of a landmark identifier (ID), a building ID, a street address, a block ID, a neighborhood ID, a city ID, a village ID, a postal delivery code, a county ID, a
parish ID, a state ID, a country ID, and a governmental level ID.  The obtaining may be based on one or more of the local table lookup, a query to an information server, obtaining a route associated with user device, obtaining current location
coordinates associated with at least one other user device associated with the user device (e.g., members a social network group), a query to the user device, and a query to another user device.  For example, the processing module obtains a route that
includes a first county ID and a second county ID, wherein the first county ID is associated with current location coordinates and the second county ID is associated with an expected next location coordinates (e.g., along a path of travel of the route)
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 96 where the processing module displays the geographic designator.  The display and includes at least one of displaying the geographic designator via a user interface output and sending the geographic designator to
the user device.  For example, processing module displays the first county ID and the second county ID.  The method continues at step 98 where the processing module obtains alert information based on the geographic designator.  The alert information
includes at least one of weather information, emergency information, drill information, natural disaster information, Homeland security information, building evacuation information, city evacuation information, Amber alert information, citizen
information, and business continuity information.  The obtaining may be based on one or more of a query to an information server, a query to a social network server, and a query to a user device.  For example, the processing module sends an alert
information request that includes the geographic designator and/or the location coordinates to the information server and receives the alert information in response.
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 100 where the processing module displays the alert information.  The display and includes at least one of sending the alert information to a user interface output, sending the alert information to one or more user
devices (e.g., a set of user device IDs), and sending the alert information to another user device, wherein the other user device is selected based on the location coordinates (e.g., close proximity).  For example, processing module displays alert
information associated with each of the first county ID, the second county ID, and a third county ID associated with another user device of a social network group that includes the user device.
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 102 where the processing module determines whether to refresh the alert information.  The determination may be based on one or more of the alert information, the location coordinates, the geographic designator, a
time period threshold, and a time period since a last obtaining of the alert information.  For example, the processing module determines to refresh the alert information when 10 minutes has passed since last obtaining alert information and a fixed time
period threshold is 9 minutes.  As another example, the processing module determines to refresh the alert information when 3 minutes has passed since last obtaining alert information and a variable time period threshold is 2 minutes based on the alert
information indicating a tornado warning.  As yet another example, the processing module determines to refresh the alert information when receiving a change in location comets associated with the other user device.  The method branches to step 104 when
the processing module determines to not refresh the alert information.  The method loops back to step 98 when the processing module determines to refresh the alert information.
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 104 where the processing module determines whether to refresh the geographic designator.  The determination may be based on one or more of the alert information, the location coordinates, the geographic designator,
the location coordinates history, a variable geographic designator time period threshold, a time period since last refreshing the alert information, receiving updated location coordinates associated with the other user device, and a time period since
last refreshing the geographic designator.  For example, the processing module determines a geographic designator time period threshold to be 1 minute when the location coordinates history indicates user device movement.  As another example, the
processing module determines a geographic designator time period threshold to be 10 minutes when the location coordinates history indicates no user device movement.  The method repeats back to step 82 of FIG. 4 when the processing module determines to
refresh the geographic designator.  The method loops back to step 102 when the processing module determines not to refresh the geographic designator.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an example of generating individual alert information, which includes similar steps to FIG. 5.  The method begins at step 106 where a processing module (e.g., of an information server, of a social network
server, of an application server) obtains user device location information and user device status corresponding to a user device.  The user device location information includes at least one of location coordinates, a geographic designator, direction
information, speed information, heading information, altitude information, direction history information, a route, and a navigation path.  The obtaining may be based on one or more of a query of the user device, a lookup, a predetermination, interpreting
previous location information of the user device, and receiving a message.  The method continues with step 98 of FIG. 5 where the processing module obtains alert information based on the location information.
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 110 where the processing module modifies the alert information based on at least one of the user device status and the location information to produce individual alert information.  For example, the processing module
includes alert information corresponding to an adjacent geographic designator based on the location information and the heading information.  For instance, the processing module includes weather alert information corresponding to a next county on an
interstate Highway that is aligned with a direction of travel.
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 112 where the processing module facilitates sending the individual alert information to the user device.  The facilitation includes at least one of transmitting the individual alert information to the user device,
transmitting the individual alert information to another user device associated with substantially the same user device location information and user device status, storing the individual alert information, and responding to a subsequent query from a
user device.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an example of generating updated checklist information.  The checklist information includes at least one of a list of a plurality of items associated with emergency preparedness (e.g., a flashlight, matches, a
blanket, water, food, etc.) and an availability indicator utilized to indicate whether a particular item of the plurality of items has been obtained.  The method begins at step 114 where a processing module (e.g., of a user device) obtains the checklist
information.  The obtaining includes at least one of querying a user device, a lookup, predetermination, receiving a message, and receiving the checklist information.  The method continues at step 116 where the processing module obtains alert
information.  The obtaining includes at least one of querying a user device, querying an information server, a predetermination, and receiving a message.
<br/><br/> The method continues at step 118 where the processing module modifies the checklist information based on the alert information to produce updated checklist information.  The modifying is based on one or more of a checklist modification to alert
information table lookup and when a checklist entry compares unfavorably to a checklist entry associated with at least a portion of the alert information.  The modifying includes one or more of highlighting one or more entries of the checklist, modifying
a quantity associated with at least one entry the checklist, adding a new entry to the checklist, and deleting a previous entry from the checklist.  For example, the processing module adds a new entry to the checklist that includes a flashlight when the
alert information includes a likely power outage warning.  As another example, the processing module modifies a quantity associated with flashlight batteries from 6 to 12 when the alert information includes the likely power outage warning.  The method
continues at step 120 where the processing module displays the updated checklist information.  The displaying includes at least one of displaying the updated checklist information via a user interface output and sending the updated checklist information
to one or more other user devices (e.g., of a social network group that includes the user device) for displaying (e.g., to a set of user IDs).
<br/><br/> As may be used herein, the terms "substantially" and "approximately" provides an industry-accepted tolerance for its corresponding term and/or relativity between items.  Such an industry-accepted tolerance ranges from less than one percent to
fifty percent and corresponds to, but is not limited to, component values, integrated circuit process variations, temperature variations, rise and fall times, and/or thermal noise.  Such relativity between items ranges from a difference of a few percent
to magnitude differences.  As may also be used herein, the term(s) "operably coupled to", "coupled to", and/or "coupling" includes direct coupling between items and/or indirect coupling between items via an intervening item (e.g., an item includes, but
is not limited to, a component, an element, a circuit, and/or a module) where, for indirect coupling, the intervening item does not modify the information of a signal but may adjust its current level, voltage level, and/or power level.  As may further be
used herein, inferred coupling (i.e., where one element is coupled to another element by inference) includes direct and indirect coupling between two items in the same manner as "coupled to".  As may even further be used herein, the term "operable to" or
"operably coupled to" indicates that an item includes one or more of power connections, input(s), output(s), etc., to perform, when activated, one or more its corresponding functions and may further include inferred coupling to one or more other items. 
As may still further be used herein, the term "associated with", includes direct and/or indirect coupling of separate items and/or one item being embedded within another item.  As may be used herein, the term "compares favorably", indicates that a
comparison between two or more items, signals, etc., provides a desired relationship.  For example, when the desired relationship is that signal 1 has a greater magnitude than signal 2, a favorable comparison may be achieved when the magnitude of signal
1 is greater than that of signal 2 or when the magnitude of signal 2 is less than that of signal 1.
<br/><br/> As may also be used herein, the terms "processing module", "module", "processing circuit", and/or "processing unit" may be a single processing device or a plurality of processing devices.  Such a processing device may be a microprocessor,
micro-controller, digital signal processor, microcomputer, central processing unit, field programmable gate array, programmable logic device, state machine, logic circuitry, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or any device that manipulates signals
(analog and/or digital) based on hard coding of the circuitry and/or operational instructions.  The processing module, module, processing circuit, and/or processing unit may have an associated memory and/or an integrated memory element, which may be a
single memory device, a plurality of memory devices, and/or embedded circuitry of the processing module, module, processing circuit, and/or processing unit.  Such a memory device may be a read-only memory, random access memory, volatile memory,
non-volatile memory, static memory, dynamic memory, flash memory, cache memory, and/or any device that stores digital information.  Note that if the processing module, module, processing circuit, and/or processing unit includes more than one processing
device, the processing devices may be centrally located (e.g., directly coupled together via a wired and/or wireless bus structure) or may be distributedly located (e.g., cloud computing via indirect coupling via a local area network and/or a wide area
network).  Further note that if the processing module, module, processing circuit, and/or processing unit implements one or more of its functions via a state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry, the memory and/or memory
element storing the corresponding operational instructions may be embedded within, or external to, the circuitry comprising the state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry.  Still further note that, the memory element may
store, and the processing module, module, processing circuit, and/or processing unit executes, hard coded and/or operational instructions corresponding to at least some of the steps and/or functions illustrated in one or more of the Figures.  Such a
memory device or memory element can be included in an article of manufacture.
<br/><br/> The present invention has been described above with the aid of method steps illustrating the performance of specified functions and relationships thereof.  The boundaries and sequence of these functional building blocks and method steps have
