       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for
     sharing information related to a location also referred to herein as a
     "spot," such as spot alerts and/or spot comments (e.g., shared
     information, advertisements, etc.) received, displayed, played, and/or
     actuated, for example, on recipient mobile electronic devices proximately
     located to such location (e.g., spot). Users of the system can create
     spot alerts in which designated recipients can receive messages, such as
     spot alerts and/or spot comments (e.g., shared information,
     advertisements, etc.) received, displayed, played, and/or actuated, for
     example, on respective recipient mobile electronic devices, when located
     within a proximity of a defined location (e.g., spot).

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for sharing information related to a location, also referred to herein as a "spot", such as spot alerts and/or spot comments (e.g., shared information, advertisements, etc.)
received, displayed, played, and/or actuated, for example, on recipient mobile electronic devices proximately located to such location (e.g., spot).  Users of the systems and methods can create spot alerts in which designated recipients can receive
transmissions, such as spot alerts and/or spot comments (e.g., shared information, advertisements, etc.) that can be received, displayed, played, and/or actuated, for example, on respective recipient mobile electronic devices, when located within a
proximity of a defined location (e.g., spot).
<br/><br/> Further, in exemplary embodiments, both users and recipients, also referred to herein as "spotters" and/or "participants", can create spot alerts in which designated recipients can receive transmissions, such as spot comments on static
electronic devices, such as user electronic devices, and/or, mobile electronic devices, such as recipient mobile electronic devices.
<br/><br/> For ease, the terms users, recipients, and/or participants are, at times, described separately, however, it will be understood that any of the users, recipients, and/or participants can create and/or edit spot alerts, spot comments, and/or
various create and/or edit other aspects of the present disclosure.  This is merely for ease and is in no way meant to be a limitation.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1A, in exemplary embodiments, the systems and methods for sharing information can include various systems and/or methods that, amongst other things, can manage the content associated with locations (e.g., spots), for example,
referring to steps A-I; can manage the content associated with physical location (e.g., spots), for example, referring to steps F, G, H; can manage the content associated with mates and/or spot mates (e.g., friends, approved recipients, etc.), for
example, referring to steps D, I, E; and/or can manage the content associated with other information utilizing, for example, information from a web interface and/or applications interface (e.g., a social networking interface and/or website), recipient
mobile electronic device, and/or a user electronic device, to name a few.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, for example, referring to step F, as described in greater detail below, participants can create a single spot alert sending a single transmission (e.g., spot comment) at a single defined location, can create a single
spot alert which sends a plurality of transmissions (e.g., spot comments) at one or more of defined locations, can create a plurality of such spot alerts, and/or can create any combinations of such spot alerts and/or spot comments, to name a few.  In
exemplary embodiments, the same transmission (e.g., spot comments) can be sent to all designated recipients and/or different tailored transmissions (e.g., spot comments) can be sent to different designated recipients and/or groups of recipients, as
described below.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, each spot alert can be sent to one or more specifically designated recipients.  In exemplary embodiments, the recipients can be designated using identifying information, such as, but not limited to, email address,
mobile electronic device number, and IP address, to name a few.  Similarly, the recipients can be designated as any member of a group, such as anyone with an email address with one or more specified domain names (e.g., Harvard.edu, JingleTech.com, etc.),
a domain name extension (e.g., .edu or .org, etc.), a mobile electronic device number with a certain area code and/or exchange and/or other defining characteristics to users of certain networks, and/or certain class of IP address, to name a few.  Groups
can be defined by other associations too.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, for example, referring to step D, the location can be defined by designating a specific location and related range (e.g., 100 Main Street, Any town, Any state, USA, Area Code, Zip Code, Range, 0.5 mile range, etc.), as
described below, by designating a zip code, a city, a village, a school district, a county, a state, a plurality of the same, and/or a combination of such designations, to name a few.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, a user create and/or edit one or more spot alerts using an account to access the systems and methods either directly and/or through another website, such as a social networking interface and/or website, like <b><i>Facebook,</i></b>
LinkedIn, or the like.  Further, to access the systems and methods, users can be required to input user account information that can include, but is not limited to, such items as e-mail address and/or phone number, name (first and/or last), user name,
and password, to name a few.  Different or other user information can be used to create and/or edit an account by a system operator consistent with the spirit and scope of the present invention.  Such information can be modified by user over time as
appropriate.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, involving the use of one or more social networking interface and/or websites, a user can connect to other potential recipients.  By way of illustrating, in the context of a social networking interface and/or website
like <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> the user can send requests and/or receive requests from others to become friends ("mates"), as one method of connecting or identifying potential recipients.  Such connections can further be identified as relating to groups created by the
user or others, wherein such groups can be used to create recipient lists ("spot mates").
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, a user can create and/or edit one or more spot alerts by using information such as, but not limited to, mobile recipient device information, mobile recipient device location information, mobile recipient device
identification information, location information, spot alert data information, respective spot location information, respective spot range information, respective spot comment information, and respective spot approved recipient information, to name a
few.  The spot alert can be identified by the user, for example, by name, number, and/or other designation, to name a few.  Further, the spot alert can be identified by the system automatically, for example, using an identification number and/or other
designation to identify, create, and/or edit the spot alert.  The spot alert can also be identified by including audio and/or visual information associated with the spot alert such as, but not limited to, a picture, a video, a tone, a jingle, and/or
other sound and/or image, to name a few.  The spot alert location can include specific coordinates, and/or other forms of identifying information, to name a few.
<br/><br/> As discussed below, spot alerts can include various permission for various information that can include, but is not limited to, information such as, but not limited to, mobile recipient device information, mobile recipient device location
information, mobile recipient device identification information, location information, spot alert data information, respective spot location information, respective spot range information, respective spot comment information, and respective spot approved
recipient information, to name a few.  In exemplary embodiments, various permissions for various information can be tiered such that different recipients are entitled to receive access to different spot alert data information and/or various information
at the same and/or different locations from other approved recipients.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1B, in exemplary embodiments, for example, referring to step F, a participant (e.g., user who originates a spot, user who creates a location, etc.) can create locations (e.g., spots) by, for example, being in the physical
location of the spot they wish to create with a mobile electronic device, referred to as mobile electronic device spot creation and/or by manually entering the variables affiliated with a spot from a static electronic device, referred to as static
electronic device creation.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, the process for creating a spot can be substantially similar whether done utilizing a mobile electronic device and/or static electronic device.  In exemplary embodiments, where a mobile electronic device is used,
locations (e.g., spots) can be generated by using location information affiliated with the mobile electronic device, such as GPS. In exemplary embodiments, where a static electronic device is used, a spot can be generated by using location information
affiliated with the static electronic device, such as IP address.  In exemplary embodiments, using a mobile electronic device and/or a static electronic device, coordinates can be entered manually by the participant in appropriate forms, such as, but not
limited to, the form of an address, latitude coordinates, and/or longitude coordinates, to name a few.  In exemplary embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed can utilize a location based API or other application, such as Google Maps to, for
example, display locations (e.g., spots) graphically.
<br/><br/> Further, in exemplary embodiments, each spot can include variables including, but not limited to, spot name, spot coordinates, spot category, spot permissions, spot tone, spot picture, and on the spot, to name a few.  In exemplary embodiments, a
participant who creates a spot and/or location can be referred to as the spot originator and/or location originator.  The spot can be given a name that can be a descriptive title given by the spot originator and/or location originator to describe a given
spot.  Spot coordinates can be the Cartesian grid (e.g., GPS coordinates) coordinates of a spot.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, spots can be categorized (e.g., spot categories) that can define the classification of a spot (e.g., spot food, spot fun, spot shop, spot drink, spot entertainment, spot activity, a spot experiences, etc.).  Spot
permissions can define which spot mates and/or mates have access to a given spot.  A spot tone can be a ring tone and/or a participant recorded audio segment, designated by the spot originator and/or location originator, which plays when a spot alert
and/or spot comment is, for example, activated.  An audio (e.g., a spot recording) and/or visual transmission (e.g., a spot picture, a spot video, etc.) can be attached and/or created any participant, for example, when they are writing at a spot and/or
location and when creating and/or editing information about a spot and/or location, to name a few.  Various transmissions from various participants can be aggregated into a feed of comments, submitted by participants, and/or displayed uniquely for each
individual spot, to name a few.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1C, in exemplary embodiments, for example, referring to step G, locations (e.g., spots) can be searched using various techniques such as, but not limited, to a near me search, a keyword search, and/or a category search, to name
a few.  Searches can access the pre-existing web application interface to retrieve the data regarding variables affiliated with various spots, locations, spot alerts, and spot comments, to name a few.  A near me search can allow a participant to search
for locations (e.g., spots) they have permission to access.  For example, this search method can provide the participant with a map identifying locations (e.g., spots) surrounding them on a map based on, for example, their current GPS location.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, cache location (e.g., spot) can be identified by a color code that can be directly correlated to a category affiliated with that location.  These category color codes can be assigned by participants and/or can be
automatically assigned, for example, at a later date, by participants, and/or by any of the systems and/or methods disclosed, to name a few.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, a keyword search can allow participants to search all of their spot mates' locations (e.g., spots) based participant input, for example, a defined string of text.  By way of example, if this defined string of text
appears in the spot of any spot mates' locations (e.g., spots), and in which the participant has been given the appropriate spot permissions, that spot can then appear in the keyword search results.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, a category search can allow participants to search all of their spot mates' locations (e.g., spots) based on categories affiliated with various spots.  By way of example, if the requested spot category matches any spot
mates' locations (e.g., spots), and which the participant has been given the appropriate spot permissions, that spot can appear in the category search results.  Further, in exemplary embodiments, spot search results can be sorted by the distance from the
current location of the participant.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1D, in exemplary embodiments, for example, referring to step H, when a participant physically enters into the area of a spot, that they have the proper permissions to access with a mobile electronic device, they can receive a
spot alert and/or spot comment on their mobile electronic device.  As discussed below, this spot alert and/or spot comment can consist of a spot ringtone/jingle, picture, light box, etc., to name a few.  Further, after receiving the spot notification,
the participant can then be able to view the spot variables, write about the spot (e.g., while on that spot), create and/or edit other information, and/or upload their own spot transmissions (e.g., pictures, audio transmissions, video transmissions,
etc.), to name a few.  In exemplary embodiments, participants can opt out of any spot.  Participants can also create additional locations (e.g., spots) and/or create additional spot alerts and/or spot comments for various locations.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, the systems and methods can transmit spot alerts and/or spot comments, based on spot alert data information, such that recipient mobile electronic devices can have spot alerts and/or spot comments received, displayed,
played, and/or actuated, for example, when that recipient mobile electronic device is located within a spot location and/or predefined range from a predetermined location.  This spot alert data information can be based on variables such as, but not
limited to information such as, but not limited to, mobile recipient device information, mobile recipient device location information, mobile recipient device identification information, location information, spot alert data information, respective spot
location information, respective spot range information, respective spot comment information, and respective spot approved recipient information, and any other form of information affiliated with any number of locations that can be analyzed to determine
whether spot alerts and/or spot comments should be transmitted to recipient mobile electronic devices.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, the spot alert data information can include respective spot approved recipient information such that a user can restrict the transmission of spot comments based on variables, such as, but not limited to, spot alert data
information, respective spot location information, respective spot range information, respective spot comment information, and respective spot approved recipient information, to name a few.  Further, in exemplary embodiments, the user can restrict the
transmission of spot comments to specific recipients, groups of recipients, and/or tiers of recipients, to name a few.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, to input information, such as a user restricting the transmission of spot comments, users, amongst others, can access a website, such as, a social networking interface and/or website that can include automatically
populated information, for example, using user electronic devices.  Further, in exemplary embodiments, to input information, such as add locations, spot comments, and spot alert data information, to name a few, users and/or recipients, amongst others,
can access a website and/or application, such as a social networking interface and/or website, for example, using recipient mobile electronic devices.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, the inputting of information can be from users and recipients such that information can be created, modified, edited, deleted and/or aggregated using user electronic devices and/or recipient mobile electronic devices. 
Further, information can be received from, transmitted to, and/or input using a website, such as, a social networking interface and/or website, e-mail providers, contact lists, and/or any other source of information, to name a few.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, participants can update spot alerts and/or spot comments based on the location of other participants.  For example, if a recipient is detected as having passed a location (e.g., using triangulation), another participant
can transmit a spot alert and/or spot comment to that recipient.  By way of example, if a recipient is detected as having missed a location (e.g., a turn off point on route to a ski house) a user can create a spot alert and/or transmission alerting the
user that they have missed the location.  Of course other participants and/or the systems and/or methods can automatically and/or in response to another participant missing a location create a spot alert and/or spot comment.
