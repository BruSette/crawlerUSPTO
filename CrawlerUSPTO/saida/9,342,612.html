       <p> A social networking system provides a personalized set of bookmarks to a
     user based on the user's interactions with the bookmarks and/or the items
     associated with the bookmarks. The personalized set of bookmarks is
     grouped by category, and the categories are ordered in accordance with
     rankings for the categories. The rankings for the categories are
     determined based on the highest ranked item from each category of item,
     and the ranking of the items is determined based on the user's
     interactions with the bookmarks and/or associated items.

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> This invention relates generally to social networking, and in particular to providing personalized bookmarks to a user in an interface of a social networking system.
<br/><br/> Bookmarks provide convenient access to pages, applications, and groups in an online system.  Without a bookmark, a user may have to navigate though a menu structure or through multiple pages to reach a page, application or group.
<br/><br/> In a conventional online system, the same set of bookmarks is displayed to all of the users.  However, this static approach is not ideal for all users.  For example, a user may have no interest in the items in the set of bookmarks.  In systems
where bookmarks are not static, users are typically required to set up and manage their own bookmarks.  Accordingly, there is a need for better mechanisms for selecting and ordering bookmarks.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Systems and methods are disclosed herein for generating personalized bookmarks for an interface of a social networking system based on user activity.  These methods and systems help provide users with a set of personalized bookmarks without
requiring user setup.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a menu of bookmarks in an interface of a social networking system includes links to different items accessible in the system, arranged by category.  Each of the items is associated with a category from a plurality of
categories.  The social networking system observes a user's interactions with at least some of the items in the menu of bookmarks, where the interactions may be via the menu of bookmarks and/or independent of it.  The items are then ranked based on the
user's interaction with the items.  In one embodiment, a highest ranked item is determined for each category.  The categories are ranked based on the highest ranked item for each category.  A bookmark link is generated for each of the items, where the
bookmark link provides a link to the corresponding item in the social networking system.  A menu of bookmarks grouped by category is generated, where the categories are ordered in accordance with the relative ranking of the items corresponding to the
bookmark links.  The menu of bookmark links is sent to a user for display, for example in a display screen of the social networking system. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Overview of Generating Personalized Bookmarks
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a diagram of a social networking system 100 for generating personalized bookmarks based on user activity.  Personalized bookmarks provide an effective tool for navigating a website or social networking system.  Additionally, the
personalized bookmarks disclosed herein need not require user setup or management.  As illustrated in FIG. 1, the user database 120 provides a user's data 130 to the item scoring module 112 and the item information database 122 provides item information
132 to the item scoring module 112.  The item scoring module 112 scores and ranks items based on the user's data 130 and the item information 132.
<br/><br/> The items may provide access to interactive features of the social networking system, ether provided directly by the social networking system 100 or available via that system.  For example, the items may include links to pages, groups, friend
lists or friend profiles, a newsfeed, and applications.  The applications may include, for example, a photo album application, a messaging application, an event planning application, an application offering deals, a marketplace application, a blogging
application, an application for managing friend lists, a survey application, a gaming application, or any other application that can be accessed via the social networking system interface.
<br/><br/> The category ranking module 114 determines items scores and generates a set of ranked categories 136 based on the item scores.  In some embodiments, the category ranking module 114 determines the highest ranked item from each category and
generates a set of ranked categories 136 based on the highest ranked item from each category.  The bookmark selection module 116 generates a set of bookmarks 134.  The set of bookmarks is grouped by category and the categories are ordered based on the
set of ranked categories 136.  The bookmark links in each category are ordered in accordance with the relative ranking of the items corresponding to the bookmark links.  As used herein, a "bookmark" is a link or reference that provides a user with access
to an interactive feature available via a social networking system.  The set of bookmark links 134 is sent to the display generator module 117 to send to the user for display.
<br/><br/> For each user, the user database 120 stores user account information, profile information, friendship or connection information, user activity information, usage statistics, user group information, friend list information, associated application
information, favorite bookmark information, associated page information, item scoring information, and other user-related data.  The profile information for the user may include the user's age, work experience, gender, educational history, interests,
geographic location, marital status, household size, political party, and the like.
<br/><br/> User group information includes a list of groups that a user belongs to.  A group is an area where users can share and collaborate on a topic or idea.  For example, a user may belong to a group about sports where users exchange opinions about
sports.  The associated application information includes a list of applications that a user's account is associated with.  The applications may include the applications discussed above.  The associated page information includes a list of pages that a
user is associated with.  In some embodiments, the pages are fan pages for a corporation, product, or public figure.  Pages are organized by topic or entity and allow public figures and organizations to broadcast messages to their fans.  Favorite
bookmark information includes a list of items that a user frequently uses.  Friend list information includes friend lists created by a user.  A user may create lists of friends in order to make it easier to send messages to certain users, to filter
content such as news stories and to control which users can view the user's information and posted content.  In some embodiments, the information for a user includes notification numbers for items the user interacts with.  For example, a notification
number may indicate that there are a number of requests for a gaming application or that there are a number of event requests for a user.  The item scoring information includes scores and rankings for items with which the user interacts.
<br/><br/> User activity information includes information about a user's actions or interactions.  The activity information may include a time stamp of when the interaction occurred, a target identifier for the item that the interaction was directed, the
interaction type, and a duration of the activity.  The interaction type may be specific to an item.  For example, the type of interactions for an event planning application may include viewing an event, creating an event, responding to an event
invitation, and posting content to a page associated with an event.  The duration of an activity measures the amount of time a user spends interacting with an item.  For example, the duration may measure the amount of time a user played a game.  In some
embodiments, the user activity information includes times and dates a user logs onto the social networking system 100.
<br/><br/> The activity information may include usage statistics for a user's interactions.  The usage statistics may include the number of times a user has selected a link corresponding to an application, a group, a bookmark, a friend list, or a page. 
The usage statistics may further include the amount of money a user spent in association with an item such as a game or application.  For example, a user may have purchased virtual goods in a game.  The usage statistics may include information
identifying the time period in which the activities corresponding to the usage statistics took place.  For example, the usage statistics may store the number of times a user has selected a link in a 30 day period.  In some embodiments, the usage
statistics include the number of times a user logs onto the social networking system in a predefined period of time or an system interaction rate.  For example, a user may logon once a day or once a week.
<br/><br/> The item information database 122 stores item information.  The item information for an item may identify one or more categories associated with the item.  In some embodiments, the categories include pages, groups, applications, and favorite
bookmarks.  In some embodiments, the item information for an item includes usage statistics for the item.  The usage statistics may be determined from groups of users including connections of a particular user, users that share a profile characteristic
with a particular user, or all users.  The usage statistics for the item may include the average amount of time a user spends interacting with the item, the average amount of money a user spends on the item and the average number of clicks over a period
of time for the item.  In some embodiments, the item information for an item includes one or more popularity scores for the item.  The one or more popularity scores may correspond to the different groups of users discussed above.  In some embodiments,
the item information database 122 stores an icon for each item, where the icon represents a respective item.  For example, an icon for a gaming application may include a picture of an object in the game.
<br/><br/> These embodiments describing generation of personalized bookmarks based on user activity are merely meant to be exemplary and are not intended to be restrictive.  In other embodiments, there are more or fewer components performing the same or
substantially similar functions as the components of the embodiment of FIG. 1.  For instance, the user database 120 and the item information database 122 may all comprise the same storage entity.  In addition, as will be discussed below, in some
embodiments, the functionality of the item scoring module 112, the category ranking module 114 and display generator 117 module may be provided by the social networking system.  In other embodiments, all or part of this functionality may be provided
external to the social networking system.
<br/><br/> System Overview
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a high level block diagram of a distributed system 200 according to one embodiment of the invention.  The system 200 includes one or more clients 202 and a social networking system 100 connected by a network 204.  In some embodiments,
the social networking system 100 is implemented as a single server, while in other embodiments it is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers.  For convenience of explanation, the social networking system 100 is described below as being
implemented on a single server system, but the social networking system 100 may be implemented on a plurality of server computers.  In some embodiments, system 200 is a social networking system.
<br/><br/> The communication network(s) 204 can be any wired or wireless local area network (LAN) and/or wide area network (WAN), such as an intranet, an extranet, or the Internet.  It is sufficient that the communication network 204 provides communication
capability between the client devices 202 and the social networking system 100.  In some embodiments, the communication network 204 uses the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) and the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to transmit
information between devices or systems.  HTTP permits client device 202 to access various resources available via the communication network 204.  The various embodiments of the invention, however, are not limited to the use of any particular protocol.
<br/><br/> A user interacts with the social networking system 100 using a client device 202, which may be any suitable computer device that is capable of connecting to the social networking system 100 via communication network 204, such as a computer, a
desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet device, a netbook, an internet kiosk, a personal digital assistants, a mobile phone and a gaming device.  The client device 202 may communicate with the social networking system 100 via an application 228
such as a web browser or native application.  Typical interactions between the client device 202 and the social networking system 100 include operations such as viewing profiles of other users of the social networking system 100, sending messages to
other users, contributing and interacting with media items, joining groups, listing and confirming attendance at events, checking in at locations, liking certain pages, creating pages, and performing other tasks that facilitate social interaction.
<br/><br/> The server system includes an interaction module 118, a display generator module 117, an item scoring module 112, a category ranking module 114, a user database 120 and an item information database 122.
<br/><br/> The interaction module 118 monitors interactions on the system and updates information in the user database 120 and/or item information database 122.  For example, the interaction module 118 may update a user's activity information in the user
database 120 when the user plays a game.  In this example, the interaction module 118 may also update item information for the game in the item information database 122.  The interaction module 118 may also determine usage statistics for information
stored in the item information database 122.
<br/><br/> The item scoring module 112 scores and ranks items based on user activity.  The scoring module 112 identifies a user, determines scores and ranks for the items the user has interacted with, and updates the user's information with the determined
scores and ranks for the items.  A user's score for an item or item score is determined based on the user's interactions with the item or a bookmark link for the item.  The item scoring module 112 retrieves information about the user from the user
database 120 and information about items from the item information database 122 in order to generate the user's item scores.  The score for an item may include contributions from multiple factors.  For example, the score for an item may be a product or
sum of multiple scores determined based on different aspects of a user's activity with the item.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the user's score for an item is based on the number of interactions the user has with the item.  For example, an item that a user interacts with 40 times is scored higher than an item the user interacts with 10 times.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the user's score for an item is based on the number of times the user interacted with the item over a period of time or the user's rate of interaction with the item.  For example, a user may select the bookmark link for a
game 40 times over a 30 day period.  In some embodiments, the user's score for an item is decayed or weighted based on the user's rate of interaction with the social networking system 100.  The system interaction rate corresponds to how often a user logs
onto the social networking system 100.  For example, a first decay factor or weight may be assigned to a user's items if the user logs onto the social networking system 100 once a day and a second decay factor or weight may be assigned to a user's items
if the user logs onto the social networking system once a day.  The item score module 112 may store a table that contains scores and/or decay factors for different rates of interaction.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the user's interactions with an item are based on the number of interactions with an item that last for at least a predefined amount of time.  In this case, inadvertent clicks are not considered when determining an item's
score.  For example, a user may inadvertently select a link for a game and then immediately exit the game.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the user's score for an item is based the type of interaction the user has with the item.  The item scoring module 112 may store a table that includes scores for different types of interactions for respective items.  The
table may, for example, store scores for different actions relating to a group item.  In this example, the action of posting content to a group may be scored higher than the action of merely viewing the page of the group.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the item scores may be decreased based on a decay factor.  Thus, if a user does not interact with an item for some time, the score of the item will be decreased.  Some embodiments employ the approach of accounting for the
actions in specific windows of time, and discounting or weighting the windows of time differently.  For example, actions in the last 30 days may be associated with a discount factor of 0.5 while actions in the last 90 days may be associated with a
discount factor of 0.25.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the score of an item is based at least in part on the amount of money a user spent in association with the item.  The user's score for an item is increased in proportion to the amount of money the user spent in association
with the item.  For example, if the user spent 20 dollars on a gaming application and 10 dollars on a deal application, the user's score for the gaming application will be increased more than the user's score for the deal application.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a user's score of an item is based at least in part on a popularity score for the item among a group of users.  The group of users may include the user's friends, users that share a common profile characteristic with the
user, or all users.  The item scoring module 112 may retrieve popularity scores for a respective item from the item information database 122 and adjust the user's score for the item based on the retrieved popular scores.  In some embodiments, the
popularity score for the item is used to adjust the user's score for the item if the popularity score is above a threshold score.  Thus, if an item is sufficiently popular with a group of users, the score of the item may be adjusted for the user in
accordance with the popularity score.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, an item that the user has recently started to interact with is given a default score.  For example, the user may have recently joined a group, joined a fan page or starting playing a game.  The default scores may correspond
to the user's average item score or a popularity score for the item.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the item scoring module 112 ranks the scored items and produces a list of ranked items.  The list of ranked items may be stored in the item scoring module 112 or the user database 120.  The list of ranked items includes
information identifying the items, scores for the items, and category information for each item.  The category information for an item identifies one or more categories that the item belongs to.
<br/><br/> The category ranking module 114 ranks categories of items.  As discussed above, the categories may include pages, groups, favorite links, and applications.  In some embodiments, the categories include user defined categories.  The category
ranking module 114 retrieves a user's list of ranked items from the item scoring module 112 or the user database 120 and ranks categories of items based on the retrieved list of ranked items.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the highest ranked item per category is determined, and the categories are ranked based on the highest ranked item per category.  More specifically, for each respective category, the category ranking module 114 identifies
the highest ranked item for the respective category from the list of ranked items and adds the highest ranked item to a list of intermediate items.  For example, if a respective category includes items X, Y, and Z, and if item X is the highest ranked
item, item X is added to the list of intermediate items.  The list of intermediate items includes the highest ranked item from each respective category.  After the highest ranked item for each category is determined, the list of intermediate items is
sorted by the score of the items and a list of category rankings is determined based on the sorted list of items.  For example, if item A has a higher score than item B and item B has a higher score than item C, the category for item A is ranked higher
than the category for item B and the category for item B is ranked higher than the category for item C. The category ranking module 114 sends the list of ranked categories to the bookmark selection module 116.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the category ranking module 114 ranks categories of items based on the average item score for the items in a category.  For example, if the average score for the items in a first category is higher than the average item
score for items in a second category, the first category is ranked higher than the second category.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the category ranking module 114 score a category based on the scores of the items in the category, where the item scores are exponentially decayed.  For example, the user's score for a first item in a category contributes a
first amount to a category score and the user's score for a second item contributes a second amount to the category score, and so on.  In some embodiments, the first amount may be predefined and the subsequent amounts may be determined based on a decay
factor.  For example, the second amount may be determined based on the first amount and a decay factor or the second amount may be defined in a table stored with the category ranking module 114.  In some embodiments, the ordering the items is determined
based on the user's score for the items.  For example, the first item is the highest scored item, the second item is the second highest scored item, and so on.
<br/><br/> The bookmark selection module 116 generates a list of personalized bookmarks.  In some embodiments, the bookmark selection module 116 periodically generates a list of personalized bookmarks for a user.  For example, the list may be generated
once a day, once a week, once a month, or at a certain time.  In some embodiments, the list of personalized bookmarks is generated for a user in response to the user requesting a page.  The requested page may be a home page, a photo album, a message
page, an application page, a profile page, or any other user interface of the social networking system for which the list of bookmarks may be useful to aid the user in navigating the system.
<br/><br/> In order to generate the list of personalized bookmarks, the bookmark selection module 116 sends a request to the item scoring module 112 for a list of ranked items and a request to the category ranking module 114 for a list of ranked
categories.  For each respective category in the list of ranked categories, the bookmark selection module 116 selects a number of items corresponding to the respective category based on the ranking of the items.  For example, the bookmark selection
module 116 may select the five highest ranked groups, pages, friend lists and applications.  In some embodiments, the items with a score or ranking above a threshold are selected.  Bookmark links are generated for the selected items, grouped by
categories and sent to the display generator 112.
<br/><br/> The display generator 112 formats the list of bookmarks for display.  A menu of bookmark links is generated.  The menu displays bookmarks grouped by categories where the groups are ordered based on the ranking of the categories.  The group
corresponding to the highest ranked category is positioned first in the menu.  Each group includes a header describing the corresponding category followed by one or more bookmarks.  For example, as shown in FIG. 4, a group 401 includes a header 402 that
describes the category of the group 401 as "Favorites" and a set of bookmarks 404.  In some embodiments, the bookmarks within a group are ordered based on scores associated with the items corresponding to the bookmarks.  In some embodiments, the last
bookmark in a group corresponds to the most recently used bookmark of the group.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a user may define a set of bookmarks as their "Favorites" or the "Favorite" bookmarks may correspond to the user's N highest scored items.  The "Favorite" bookmarks may correspond to one or more categories of bookmarks.  In
some embodiments, the "Favorite" bookmarks are displayed as the first item in each category.  For example, if a game is one of the user's "Favorite" bookmarks, a bookmark for the game is displayed first in the group of bookmarks corresponding to
applications.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the display generator 112 hides or does not include categories of bookmarks that have scores below a threshold score.  As discussed above, the score for a category may correspond to the score of the highest scored item in
the category, the average score of the items in the category, or based on the exponential decay of item scores in the category.  In some embodiments, the display generator 112 hides or does not include categories of bookmarks that a user has not
interacted with for a threshold amount of time.  For example, if a user has not interacted with any items in the application category for a month, the application category of bookmarks is not displayed or included in the menu.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, an icon is added for each bookmark.  An icon may represent a bookmark or an object associated with the bookmark.  For example, as shown in FIG. 4, an icon 406 for a bookmark corresponding to a messaging application may
depict an envelope.  The icons may be displayed adjacent to the bookmarks.  The display generator 112 may retrieve an icon for a bookmark from the item information database 122.  In some embodiments, the display generator 112 formats the list of
bookmarks for display in a mobile device.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the display generator 112 adds notification numbers to the menu to be displayed next to respective bookmarks.  The display generator 112 retrieves a user's data from the user database 120 to determine whether there are
notifications corresponding to the items in the bookmark list.  The notification number has a different meaning for different items.  For example, a messaging application may have a notification number indicating the number of unread messages in the
messaging application.  In some embodiments, the notification number for a bookmark is displayed next to the bookmark.  For example, as shown in FIG. 4, a notification number 408 may be displayed next to a bookmark to indicate the number of new messages
in a group.  In some embodiments, the menu includes instructions to clear the notification number for a bookmark after the bookmark is selected.  In some embodiments, the display generator 112 includes a "more" link with each group of bookmarks.  When
the "more" link is selected by a user, the user is navigated to a page showing an expanded set of links for a respective category.  For example, if only two application links are displayed, a user may select the "more" link to view a page with additional
application links or otherwise to expand the list.  The list of bookmarks is displayed in a contiguous region of a page.  In some embodiments, the list of personalized bookmarks is formatted to be displayed along with a newsfeed, a photo album, a profile
page, an application, a group page, friend lists, or a fan page.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the menu includes instructions to display an edit icon next to a bookmark when a user's cursor is over the bookmark.  When selected, the edit icon displays options to enable a user to add a respective bookmark to the user's
"Favorite" bookmarks or to demote the bookmark and have it removed from display.
<br/><br/> Personalized Bookmarks Based on User Activity
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a flow chart of a process 300 for generating personalized bookmarks based on user activity, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.  This process 300 may be performed at a server system (e.g., social networking system 100)
having one or more processors and non-transitory memory.  The non-transitory memory stores one or more programs to be executed by the one or more processors.  The one or more programs include instructions for carrying out the process 300.
<br/><br/> In this process 300, the interaction module 112 receives 302 a plurality of a user's interactions with a plurality of items in a social networking system.  Each of the plurality of items is associated with a category from a plurality of
categories.  In some embodiments, the categories include pages, groups, applications, and favorite bookmarks.  Some of the items may be associated with multiple categories.  For example, a game may be associated with the application category and the
favorite bookmarks category.  The items have been discussed above.
<br/><br/> The item ranking module 112 ranks 304 the items based on the user's interactions with the items.  The interactions may be with the items or with links corresponding to the items.  In some embodiments, the ranking of items is based on the number
of times over a period of time the user interacted with the items.  For example, a user may have interacted with a group 25 times in a 30-day period, or the user may interact with a page 12 times a week.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the ranking of the items is based on the types of interactions the user has with the items.  The types of interactions are specific to the items and certain interactions with an item may be scored higher than other
interactions.  For example, responding to an event invitation is scored higher than viewing an event because responding to an event invitation is a stronger indicator of the user's interest.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the ranking of the items is based on the duration of the interactions.  It may be convenient for the user to have bookmarks to items that he or she spends a lot of time interacting with.  Thus, some items may be ranked or
scored higher in accordance with the duration of the user's interactions with the item.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the user's interactions are discounted based on a decay factor.  The decay factor may be based on the timestamp of each of the user's interactions with an item.  Thus, if a user stops interacting with an item, the ranking of
the item will tend to decrease.  The decay factor may cause the user's interactions to diminish slowly over time, or it may be a discrete decay that completely discounts any user interactions that are over a specified age.  The decay factor may also
depend on the type of user interaction.  For example, a user interaction in which a user posts on a page may be decayed less than a user interaction in which a user merely views a post on a page.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the ranking for at least one item is based in part on an amount of money a user has spent on goods or services offered by the item.  The amount of money a user is willing to spend in association with an item may indicate how
important an item is to the user.  For example, a user may have spent money in a game to unlock certain features of the game or to buy virtual goods in the game.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the ranking for at least one item is based at least in part on a popularity of the item among a plurality of users in addition to the user for whom the bookmarks are being ranked.  The plurality of users may be the user's
friends, the users who share a common characteristic with the user, or all users of the system.
<br/><br/> The category ranking module 114 determines 306 a highest ranked item for each category in the plurality of categories.  For example, the highest ranked item from the application category is determined.  The category ranking module 114 ranks 308
the categories based on the highest ranked item for each category in the plurality of categories.  For example, category 1 is ranked higher than category 2 if the highest ranked item from category 1 is ranked higher than the highest ranked item from
category 2.  The category corresponding to the highest ranked item is the highest ranked category, the category corresponding to the next highest ranked item not belonging to the first category is the second highest ranked category, and so on.
<br/><br/> The bookmark selection module 116 generates 310 a bookmark link for each of the set of items.  A bookmark link provides a link to the corresponding item in the social networking system.  The bookmark selection module 116 generates 312 a set of
bookmark links grouped by category.  For example, the bookmarks corresponding to the application category may be grouped together.  The groups of bookmarks are ordered in accordance with the ranking of the corresponding categories.  For example, the
group of bookmarks corresponding to the highest ranked category is placed in the first position.  Within each group, the bookmark links are ordered in accordance with the scores associated with the items corresponding to the bookmark links.  For example,
within the application group, the bookmarks are ordered based on the user's scores for the applications corresponding to the bookmarks.  The display generator 117 formats the bookmark links for display as discussed above.  The display generator 117 sends
the set of bookmark links to the user for display.
