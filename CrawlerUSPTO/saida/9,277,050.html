       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A method for providing access to a socio-RBT service is provided. The
     socio-RBT service enables updating social networking website profile of a
     user with RBT related information of the user. The method enables,
     firstly, receiving socio-RBT subscription information from the user. The
     socio-RBT subscription information comprises at least one unique
     identifier of the user. Secondly, the method enables verifying one or
     more predetermined conditions related to the user. The one or more
     predetermined conditions facilitate to determine if the user is eligible
     to access the socio-RBT service. Further, the method enables mapping the
     unique identifier of the user with a unique identifier of the user's
     social networking website profile. The method further enables obtaining
     RBT subscription information corresponding to the mapped unique
     identifier of the user. The method enables, finally, updating RBT related
     information on the social networking website profile of the user
     corresponding to the RBT subscription information.

<br/><br/> The present invention relates generally to the field of social networking websites and Ring Back Tone (RBT) services in a telecommunication network.  More specifically, the present invention provides a method and system for updating information
related to a user on a social networking website using RBT related data/information of the user.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> With advancements in communication technology, participative websites such as social networking websites are widely used to view user's profile information such as location, interests, hobbies, occupation etc. Further, social networking websites
also facilitate users/subscribers to interact with each other.  In addition, users/subscribers can also share pictures and send messages through their social networking website profile.  Examples of some popular social networking sites may include
MySpace, Orkut, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> LinkedIn and Hi5.  Over a period of time, these websites have gained popularity as they enable users to connect with existing and old friends, find new people sharing common hobbies and interests, and establish new business
contacts etc.
<br/><br/> Generally, the user's social networking website profile in a social networking website describes the user's personality traits.  Further, the social networking websites provide updates on changes made by a user to the social networking website
profile or any recent activity undertaken by the user on the social networking website.  However, these updates and activities are limited to the ones carried out by the user when he accesses a particular social networking website using a data
communications network, such as, internet.
<br/><br/> Conventionally, the only method to update the social networking website profile of a user or undertake any activity is to access the social networking website over the internet.  In certain example scenarios, when internet access is not
available due to technical fault or may be because the user is in a location where internet connectivity is not provided, the user shall not be able to update his social networking website profile or perform any other activity on a social networking
website.  Further, if the user is not a regular user of the Internet, his social networking website profile may not be updated with his personality traits which may have changed over a period of time.
<br/><br/> Moreover, traditional methods and systems do not provide any means to harness existing telecommunication services, such as, Value Added Services (VAS) for updating the social networking website profile.  Various VAS, such as, RBT are indication
of user preferences and personality traits.  Enough information can be extracted from the RBT to update the social networking website profile of the user.  As RBT provided by a telecommunication network is usually a monotonous sound heard by a caller
while waiting for a callee to respond to a call, users have an option to select a RBT of their own choice by subscribing to a RBT service.  The RBT selected by the user can be used to understand the personality traits of the user and make them available
on his social networking website.
<br/><br/> In light of the above, there is a need for a system and method for integrating social networking websites with VAS.  Further, there is a need for a system and method for integrating social networking website with RBT services.  In addition,
there is a need for a system and method that would enhance the experience of other users/subscribers browsing through the social networking websites as they would be provided with additional information about a particular user, such as, the user's
current emotional state, favorite song etc. compounded with the user's social networking website profile.  Furthermore, there is a need for a system and method where the user's social networking website profile can be updated without requirement of
Internet access. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> The present invention is described by way of embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram representing an integrated socio-RBT system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a detailed block diagram of the socio-RBT system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention; and

<br/><br/> In an embodiment of the present invention, in case it is determined that the TSP, the user is registered with has collaboration with a VAS provider of the socio-RBT service, then the user is verified as being eligible to subscribe to the
socio-RBT service.  In another embodiment of the present invention, in case it is determined that the TSP, the user is registered with has no collaboration with the VAS provider of the socio-RBT service, then it is verified whether a multi VAS module in
the RBT system has the socio-RBT service information of the user.  The user is verified to be eligible to subscribe to the socio-RBT service only if the multi VAS module has the socio-RBT service information of the user.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment of the present invention, in case it is determined that the TSP, the user is registered with has no collaboration with the VAS provider of the socio-RBT service, and the multi VAS module does not have the socio-RBT service
information of the user, then the user is not eligible for being subscribed to the socio-RBT service.  In an embodiment of the present invention, the user can be notified that the socio-RBT service cannot be provided to him.
<br/><br/> In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the verification of authenticity of the user may involve an authentication message to be sent to the user.  The authentication message includes details of one or more of the socio-RBT service
requested by the user and a request to reply to the authentication message.  For example, the user may receive an SMS on the MSISDN provided by the user.  The SMS may inform the user about the particular socio-RBT service the user has requested to
subscribe.  In a further embodiment of the present invention, the user is requested to reply to the SMS to confirm the request for subscription to the socio-RBT service.  In an example, the SMS may include password that the user needs to enter on his
social networking website profile for accessing the socio-RBT service.
<br/><br/> For example, in case the user requests for subscription to the socio-RBT service by calling a voice portal, the user may be required to input the password received in the social networking website profile of the user as the authentication
message.  In another embodiment of the present invention, the user may authenticate himself via a user interface.  In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the user may authenticate himself by sending a password received via SMS to a RBT
provisioning module.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment of the present invention, a check is performed to determine if the user is a RBT subscriber.  In an embodiment of the present invention, the check is performed by verifying the RBT subscription information of the user from
a RBT subscriber database.  Using MSISDN of the user, it is checked with the RBT subscriber database whether the user is a RBT subscriber or not.  In case, the user is found not to be a RBT subscriber, the user is subscribed to the RBT service.
<br/><br/> At step 306, unique identifier of the user is mapped with unique identifier of social networking website profile of the user.  In various embodiments of the present invention, the MSISDN of the user is mapped with the corresponding social
networking website profile of the user.
<br/><br/> At step 308, RBT subscription information corresponding to the mapped information is obtained.  In various embodiments of the present invention, RBT Identification (ID) and RBT statistics information of the RBT subscribed by the user is obtained
corresponding to the MSISDN or IMSI number of the user.  In an embodiment of the present invention, TSP of the user is determined based on the MSISDN of the user.  Further, RBT ID and RBT statistics information corresponding to the MSISDN of the user are
extracted from the RBT subscriber database.  In another embodiment of the present invention, in case the VAS provider providing the socio-RBT service is different from the VAS provider providing the RBT service to the user, a RBT social plug-in module
extracts the RBT ID and the RBT statistics information from the multi VAS module, based on the request and MSISDN retrieved from the mapped information.  In another embodiment of the present invention, RBT ID and the RBT statistics information may be
extracted when the user logs into his social networking website profile.
<br/><br/> At step 310, the social networking profile of the user is updated.  In various embodiments of the present invention, using the RBT ID and RBT statistics information the RBT related information corresponding to the obtained RBT ID and the RBT
statistics information is updated on the social networking website profile of the user.  Further, the RBT related information is published on the web page of the respective social networking website profile of the user based on the preferences selected
by the user.  In an embodiment of the present invention, the social networking website may publish the RBT related information on the web page of the respective social networking website profile of the user based on the preferences selected by the user. 
For example, if the user selects an option to provide updates about his RBT, to other users tagged as `Friends` in his social networking website, only the users/subscribers added as "Friends" by the user receives a message on their respective social
networking website profiles, informing them of the RBT that the user has subscribed to and the RBT statistics information of the RBT.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment of the present invention, emoticon corresponding to the RBT ID may be retrieved from a media-emoticons mapping unit which is updated on the social networking website profile of the user.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments of the present invention, the user can update subscription to the socio-RBT service in case he wants to modify his subscription to the socio-RBT service.  Modifying the socio-RBT service subscription may include, but
without limitation, adding one or more socio-RBT service.  The user may update the subscription to the socio-RBT service using a plurality of interfaces including, but not limited to, Short Message Service (SMS), Interactive Voice Response (IVR), filling
form on Internet, Wireless Access Protocol (WAP), Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) etc. In an embodiment of the present invention, the social networking website can update the socio-RBT service.  Further, in an embodiment of the present
invention, other users of the socio-RBT service can visit the social networking website profile of the user to access and copy the RBT and/or socio-RBT-service profile as his own socio-RBT service profile.  Further, the other users wanting to copy the
RBT and/or socio-RBT-service profile of the user are subscribed to the socio-RBT service in case the other users are not subscribed to the socio-RBT service.
<br/><br/> While example embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be clear that the invention is not limited to these embodiments only.  Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will be
apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
