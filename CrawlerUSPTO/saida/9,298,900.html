channels 108.  A couple of examples of channels 108 are illustrated in schematic diagram 100 (as well as in additional figures, such as schematic diagram 200A of FIG. 2A).  Signals may propagate via one or more channels 108.  Signals, by way of example
but not limitation, may comprise, electrical signals, magnetic signals, electromagnetic signals, photonic signals, wireless signals, wired signals, multiples ones thereof, some combination thereof, or so forth.  However, claimed subject matter is not
limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, a server device 112 may comprise, by way of example but not limitation, one or more of: a stand-alone server, a server blade, a server rack, a bank of servers, a server farm, hardware supporting a part of a cloud
service or system, a home server, hardware running a virtualized server, one or more processors executing code to function as a server, one or more machines performing server-side functionality as described herein, at least a portion of any of the above,
some combination thereof, or so forth.  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, at least one behavioral fingerprint 110 may comprise, by way of example but not limitation, one or more indicators representing one or more behaviors of at least one user with respect to at least one user device. Examples of one or more indicators representing one or more behaviors of at least one user with respect to at least one user device may include, but are not limited to, one or more indicators representing one or more habits of at least one user with
respect to at least one user device, one or more indicators representing usage of at least one user device by at least one user, one or more indicators representing one or more actions of at least one user with respect to at least one user device, some
combination thereof, or so forth.  Additionally or alternatively, at least one behavioral fingerprint 110 may comprise, by way of example but not limitation, one or more indicators representing one or more predicted acts (e.g., behaviors, such as habits,
usages, actions, a combination thereof, etc.) of at least one user with respect to at least one device.  Additionally or alternatively, at least one behavioral fingerprint 110 may comprise, by way of example but not limitation, at least one status of a
user that is utilizing or that corresponds to a user device.  For certain example implementations, a user whose behavior is being monitored to at least partially establish at least a portion of at least one behavioral fingerprint 110 may comprise an
authorized user, which is described herein below.  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, a user may be utilizing a user device, by way of example but not limitation, if the user is accessing the user device, if the user is interacting with the user device, if the user is carrying the user device, if
the user is providing input to the user device, if the user is receiving output from the user device, if the user is directing operation of the user device, some combination thereof, or so forth.  A user may correspond to a user device, by way of example
but not limitation, if the user is an authorized user of the user device.  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, a user 104 of a user device 102 may comprise an authorized user of the user device 102: if the user 104 comprises, by way of example but not limitation, a true owner, a manager, an information technology (IT)
specialist, a controller, a purchaser, a lessee, an approved borrower, a primary user, a combination thereof, etc. of the user device 102; if the user 104 is or has been authorized by a true owner, a manager, an IT specialist, a controller, a purchaser,
a lessee, an approved borrower, a primary user, a combination thereof, etc. of the user device 102; some combination thereof; or so forth.  In certain example implementations, a determination that a user 104 comprises (e.g., is, is becoming, is being
designated, a combination thereof, etc.) an authorized user of a user device 102: may be effectuated if or when a user first registers a profile, an account, a combination thereof, etc. on a device (e.g., after a purchase or a `hard` reset); may be
effectuated if or when one or more `sign-ins` (e.g., entry of a password, code, PIN, pattern, biometric input, a combination thereof, etc.) are performed by a user; may be effectuated if or when one or more user ID/secret information combinations (e.g.,
entry of an account name, email address, individualized identification, a combination thereof, etc. along with a corresponding password, code, PIN, pattern, biometric input, a combination thereof, etc.) are entered by a user; may be effectuated if or
when a given user is identified as, designated as, or otherwise indicated to comprise an authorized user by one who is already an authorized user; some combination of such authorized user determinations; or so forth.  An authorized user may add a new
authorized user, by way of example only: by providing a name or other identification of another user or his or her biometric information (e.g., a facial photo, a voice sample, a fingerprint image, a retinal scan, a combination thereof, etc.); by
providing a name or other identification of a user or temporary or permanent secret information, such as a password, a code, a PIN, a pattern, biometric input, a combination thereof, etc. (e.g., that a newly authorized user may be capable of changing or
confirming); some combination thereof; or so forth.  An authorized user, such as a true owner or IT specialist, may be empowered to remove someone from a list of authorized user(s).  In certain example embodiments, different authorized users may have
different levels of authorization (e.g., different levels of access, capabilities, rights, privileges, a combination thereof, etc.) with respect to a given user device 102.  For certain example implementations, but by way of example only, one authorized
user may comprise an administrator with full access rights or privileges, yet another authorized user may comprise a regular, non-administrative, or junior user with fewer access rights or privileges.  Additionally or alternatively, one authorized user
may have full access rights to applications and content stored on a device or associated with a particular account/profile, yet another authorized user may have restricted access rights to applications or content stored on a device such that access is
prevented, for instance, to particular device settings or adult content.  Other approaches to providing different levels of authorization may also or instead be implemented.  By way of example only, an authorized user who is a true owner may add a new
authorized user that is permitted to utilize existing applications and content but is prohibited from adding new applications or making particular purchases (e.g., individual purchases above a predetermined dollar amount or multiple purchases beyond a
total dollar amount).
<br/><br/> FIG. 2A is a schematic diagram 200A of multiple user devices, multiple server devices, and at least one behavioral fingerprint, any of which may be involved individually or jointly in example authentication scenarios in accordance with certain

fingerprint 110, or at least one server device 112.  More specifically, schematic diagram 200A may include, by way of example only, three user devices 102 (e.g., a user device 102A, a user device 102B, or a user device 102C, etc.), two server devices 112
(e.g., a server device 112A, or a server device 112B, etc.), or two behavioral fingerprints 110 (e.g., a behavioral fingerprint 110a, or a behavioral fingerprint 110b, etc.).
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, a user 104 may correspond to or be utilizing multiple user devices 102, such as at least two of user device 102A, user device 102B, or user device 102C, at least partially simultaneously or from time to time.  By
way of example only, a user 104 may own at least two of: a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a vehicle with an intelligent computing apparatus, a laptop computer, or a desktop computer.  For certain example implementations, at least part of a combined
behavioral fingerprint 110 (e.g., a behavioral fingerprint 110a/110b) may be associated with a user 104 and each corresponding user device 102.  Additionally or alternatively, an individualized behavioral fingerprint 110 (e.g., a behavioral fingerprint
110a or a behavioral fingerprint 110b) may be associated with a user 104 and each corresponding individual or respective user device 102.  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples,
etc.

combination thereof, or so forth.  Additionally or alternatively, a behavioral fingerprint 110, 110a, or 110b; an at least partially combined instantiation of at least two of a behavioral fingerprint 110, 110a, or 110b; a portion of a behavioral
fingerprint 110, 110a, or 110b; a combination thereof; etc. may be transmitted, received, exchanged, a combination thereof, etc., by way of example only, via one or more of: at least one network 106, one or more channels 108, some combination thereof, or
so forth.  A user device 102 or a server device 112 may transmit, receive, exchange, a combination thereof, etc. at least a portion of a behavioral fingerprint 110, 110a, or 110b directly between or among devices 102 or 112 or indirectly via at least one
node (not explicitly shown) of one or more networks 106.  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2B is a schematic diagram 200B of multiple user devices, multiple server devices, and multiple example locations for at least a portion of at least one behavioral fingerprint in accordance with certain example embodiments.  As shown in FIG.
2B, by way of example but not limitation, schematic diagram 200B may include at least one user device 102, at least one user 104, at least one network 106, at least one channel 108, at least one behavioral fingerprint 110, or at least one server device
112.  More specifically, schematic diagram 200B may include, by way of example only, three user devices 102 (e.g., a user device 102A, a user device 102B, or a user device 102C, etc.), two server devices 112 (e.g., a server device 112A, or a server
device 112B, etc.), or six behavioral fingerprints 110 (e.g., a behavioral fingerprint 110c, a behavioral fingerprint 110d, a behavioral fingerprint 110e, a behavioral fingerprint 110f, a behavioral fingerprint 110g, or a behavioral fingerprint 110h,
etc.).
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, a given behavioral fingerprint 110 or portion thereof may be located at (stored at, distributed at least partially across, accessible from, associated with, a combination thereof, etc.) one or more devices 102 or
112.  By way of example only, a behavioral fingerprint 110c may be located at a user device 102A, a behavioral fingerprint 110d may be located at a user device 102B, a behavioral fingerprint 110e may be located at a user device 102C, a behavioral
fingerprint 110f may be located at a network 106 (e.g., at a cloud service or system), a behavioral fingerprint 110g may be located at a server device 112A, or a behavioral fingerprint 110h may be located at a server device 112B.  For certain example
implementations, any one or more of behavioral fingerprints 110c-110h may comprise one or more separate or individualized behavioral fingerprints 110; may comprise one or more combined, amalgamated, distributed, a combination thereof, etc. behavioral
fingerprints 110; may comprise at least a portion of at least one behavioral fingerprint 110; some combination thereof; or so forth.  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, at least one behavioral fingerprint 110 (e.g., of behavioral fingerprints 110c-110h) may be associated with at least one user 104 or one or more of user devices 102A, 102B, or 102C.  For certain example
implementations, a behavioral fingerprint 110c, which may be stored at a user device 102A, may be associated with a user 104 and user device 102A.  For certain example implementations, a behavioral fingerprint 110g, which may be stored at a server device
112A, may be associated with a user 104 and a user device 102A.  For certain example implementations, a behavioral fingerprint 110h, which may be stored at a server device 112B, may be associated with a user 104, a user device 102B, and a user device
102C.  For certain example implementations, a behavioral fingerprint 110c, which may be stored at a user device 102A and associated therewith, and a behavioral fingerprint 110d, which may be stored at a user device 102B and associated therewith, may be
individually or jointly associated with a user 104.  A behavioral fingerprint 110c and a behavioral fingerprint 110d may be identical to each other, partially the same, different from one another, updated to keep one at least partially coherent or
consistent with the other, some combination thereof, or so forth.  For certain example implementations, a behavioral fingerprint 110d, which may be stored at a user device 102B and associated therewith, and a behavioral fingerprint 110g, which may be
stored at a server device 112A and associated with a user device 102C, may be individually or jointly associated with a user 104.  A behavioral fingerprint 110d and a behavioral fingerprint 110g may be identical to each other, partially the same,
different from one another, updated to keep one at least partially coherent or consistent with the other, some combination thereof, or so forth.  For certain example implementations, a behavioral fingerprint 110e, which may be stored at a user device
102C and associated therewith, and a behavioral fingerprint 110h, which may be stored at a server device 1126 and also associated with user device 102C, may be individually or jointly associated with a user 104.  A behavioral fingerprint 110e and a
behavioral fingerprint 110h may be identical to each other, partially the same, different from one another, updated to keep one at least partially coherent or consistent with the other, some combination thereof, or so forth.  For certain example
implementations, a behavioral fingerprint 110e, which may be stored at a user device 102C, may be associated with a user 104 and a user device 1026.  Although each user device 102 and server device 112 (and network 106) is shown in schematic diagram 200B
as having a behavioral fingerprint 110 located there at, one or more user devices 102 or server devices 112 (or networks 106) may alternatively not have a behavioral fingerprint 110 located there at. Furthermore, other additional or alternative
approaches may instead be implemented.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, a behavioral fingerprint 110 (including but not limited to any one or more of behavioral fingerprints 110a-110h) may comprise a whole behavioral fingerprint, a portion of a behavioral fingerprint, a behavioral
fingerprint associated with a single user device, a behavioral fingerprint associated with multiple user devices, a part of a distributed behavioral fingerprint, a whole behavioral fingerprint that is distributed across multiple devices, a portion or a
whole behavioral fingerprint that is located at one device, one or more indicators of one or more behavior-related acts, some combination thereof, or so forth.  Examples of behavioral fingerprint(s) 110 are described further herein below with particular
reference to FIG. 3.  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram 300 illustrating an example behavioral fingerprint including one or more example indicators of one or more behavior-related acts in accordance with certain example embodiments.  As shown in FIG. 3, by way of example
but not limitation, schematic diagram 300 may comprise a behavioral fingerprint 110, which behavioral fingerprint 110 may include any one or more of indications of various acts 302-322 or other indications 324.  Example indications 302-324 that are
illustrated may include, but are not limited to, user interface actions 302, user movements 304, locations visited 306, social network interactions 308, communication modes employed 310, entity interactions 312, apps employed 314, transactions conducted

more components of server device 112.  Power source 514 may comprise, by way of example but not limitation, a power connector for accessing an electrical grid, a fuel cell, a solar power source, some combination thereof, or so forth.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an entity interface 516 may enable one or more entities (e.g., another device, a person, a group, a robotic entity, a combination thereof, etc.) to provide input to or receive output from server device 112. 
Interactions between an entity and a device may relate, by way of example but not limitation, to inputting or outputting instructions, commands, settings, parameters, indications, some combination thereof, or so forth.  Certain entity interfaces 516 may
enable both entity input and entity output at server device 112 or over at least one network link, such as one or more channels 108 (e.g., of FIGS. 1 and 2A).
<br/><br/> However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, or so forth.  For instance, it should be understood that for certain example implementations components that are illustrated
separately in FIG. 5 need not necessarily be separate or mutually exclusive.  For example, a given component may provide multiple functionalities.  By way of example only, hard-wired logic 506 may form circuitry 508.  Additionally or alternatively, a
single component such as a connector may function as a communication interface 510 or as an entity interface 516.  Additionally or alternatively, one or more instructions 518 may function to realize at least one setting or parameter 520.
<br/><br/> It should also be understood that for certain example implementations components that are illustrated in schematic diagram 500 or described herein may not be integral or integrated with a server device 112.  For example, a component may be
removably connected to a server device 112, a component may be wirelessly coupled to a server device 112, one or more components of a server device 112 may be geographically distributed or separated from one another, some combination thereof, or so
forth.  By way of example only, instructions 518 may be stored on one medium 504, and settings/parameters 520 (or another portion of instructions 518) may be stored on a different medium 504, which may comprise a same server or a part of a different
server of, e.g., a server farm.  Additionally or alternatively, respective processor-media sets may be physically realized on different or respective server blades or server containers.  Multiple server blades, for instance, may be linked or interlinked
to realize at least one server device 112.  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 6A and 6B are schematic diagrams 600A and 600B of an example user device and an example server device, respectively, that have one or more functional units in accordance with certain example embodiments.  As shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, by

not limited to, at least one authentication unit 602, at least one authorization unit 604, at least one behavioral fingerprint unit 606, a combination thereof, or so forth.  However, a user device 102 or a server device 112 may alternatively include
more, fewer, or different unit(s) from those that are illustrated without departing from claimed subject matter.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, a unit may be comprised of at least one processor (e.g., a processor 402 of FIG. 4, a processor 502 of FIG. 5, a combination thereof, etc.), one or more media (e.g., a medium 404 of FIG. 4, a media medium 504 of
FIG. 5, a combination thereof, etc.), instructions (e.g., processor-executable instructions, instructions 420 of FIG. 4, instructions 518 of FIG. 5, computer-implementable instructions, a combination thereof, etc.), logic (e.g., logic 406 of FIG. 4,
logic 506 of FIG. 5, a combination thereof, etc.), circuitry (e.g., circuitry 408 of FIG. 4, circuitry 508 of FIG. 5, a combination thereof, etc.), other described or illustrated component(s), some combination thereof, or so forth.  For certain example
implementations, one or more units (e.g., an authentication unit 602, an authorization unit 604, a behavioral fingerprint unit 606, a combination thereof, etc.) of at least one user device 102 may function or interoperate with one or more units of at
least one server device 112.  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an authentication unit 602 may operate to authenticate a user of a device.  For certain example implementations, a user of a device may be authenticated by determining to some (e.g., reasonable, acceptable,
measurable, quantifiable, a combination thereof, etc.) degree an identity of a user.  By way of example but not limitation, an authentication unit 602 may enable implementation of multiple degrees of authentication, with different degrees of
authentication corresponding to different levels of certainty of an identity of a user.  Example aspects related to authentication are described further herein (e.g., at least herein above with particular reference to FIG. 1).  However, claimed subject
matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.

profiles, data, capabilities, a combination thereof, etc. of at least one device, such as a user device 102 or a server device 112.  For certain example implementations, authorization may be fully or at least partially granted, denied, withheld, a
combination thereof, etc. based at least partially on an authentication determination, a result from an authentication unit 602, some combination thereof, or so forth.  By way of example but not limitation, an authorization unit 604 may provide for
different levels of authorization, including but not limited to for a given authorized user, that correspond to different degrees of authentication, that correspond to different user identities, some combination thereof, or so forth.  Example aspects
related to authorization are described further herein (e.g., at least herein above with particular reference to FIG. 1).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, a behavioral fingerprint unit 606 may operate to implement, perform, facilitate performance of, a combination thereof, etc. one or more flow diagrams, methods, processes, procedures, operations, functionality,
technology, mechanisms, a combination thereof, etc. that are described herein or illustrated in the accompanying drawings or that relate to at least one behavioral fingerprint.  For certain example implementations, a behavioral fingerprint unit 606 may
provide information, monitored acts, likelihood values, determinations, comparisons, analyses, indications, predicted acts, a combination thereof, etc. to an authentication unit 602 on which it may at least partially base an authentication determination. Example aspects related to behavioral fingerprinting are described further herein above and below.  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.

<br/><br/> FIG. 8A is a flow diagram 800A illustrating an example method for at least one device with regard to behavioral fingerprinting via inferred personal relation in accordance with certain example embodiments.  As illustrated, flow diagram 800A may
include any of operations 802-804.  Although operations 802-804 are shown or described in a particular order, it should be understood that methods may be performed in alternative manners without departing from claimed subject matter, including, but not
limited to, with a different order or number of operations or with a different relationship between or among operations.  Also, at least some operation(s) of flow diagram 800A may be performed so as to be fully or partially overlapping with other
operation(s).  For certain example embodiments, one or more operations of flow diagram 800A may be performed by at least one server device (e.g., a server device 112).  Alternatively, one or more operations of flow diagram 800A may be performed by at
least one user device (e.g., a user device 102).
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, a method for behavioral fingerprinting via inferred personal relation, which method may be at least partially implemented using hardware (e.g., circuitry, at least one processor, processor-accessible memory, a
combination thereof, etc.) such as that of a server device, may comprise an operation 802 or an operation 804.  An operation 802 may be directed at least partially to inferring at least one indication of personal relation for at least one authorized user
via at least one user-device interaction.  For certain example implementations, at least one server device 112 may infer (e.g., deduce, ascertain, derive, conclude an existence of, glean, surmise, discover, determine, a combination thereof, etc.) at
least one indication of personal relation 706 (e.g., one or more indications representing one or more familial relations (e.g., legal, biological, marital, family-in-law such as mother-in-law, parent-child, natural parent-child, adopted parent-child,

best friend, a combination thereof, etc.), representing one or more intimate relations (e.g., boyfriend, girlfriend, significant other, partner, fiance, spouse, domestic partner, a combination thereof, etc.), representing one or more employment or
professional relations (e.g., employer, employee, contractor, boss, partner, a combination thereof, etc.), some combination thereof, etc. between or among at least one authorized user and one or more individuals) for at least one authorized user (e.g., a
user 104 that is authorized to use a given user device 102 to at least some extent, a user 104 that is associated with a behavioral fingerprint 110 corresponding to a given user device 102, a combination thereof, etc.) via at least one user-device
interaction 710 (e.g., at least one interaction (e.g., a user inputting or sending data or information into or to a device, a user selecting from between or among options provided or offered by a device, a user submitting a request to a device, a user
responding to an inquiry from a device, a user viewing or otherwise visiting one or more internet locations via a device, a user entering one or more search terms via a device, a user making one or more purchases via a device, a user visiting one or more
physical locations with a device, a combination thereof, etc.) between or among at least one user (e.g., an authorized user, an unauthorized user, a user that is authorized by designation, a combination thereof, etc.) and one or more devices (e.g., a
user device 102, a server device 112, a combination thereof, etc.)).  By way of example but not limitation, a service provider (e.g., an authentication service provider operating at least partially via a cloud computing service or a web infrastructure,
such as Apple's iCloud or ebay's PayPal) may infer (e.g., deduce based at least partly on (i) a user response to a device inquiry or (ii) a user submission of a request to or order from a device) at least one indication (e.g., a label, a categorization,
a code, a tag, an assignment, one or more words, a combination thereof, etc.) of personal relation (e.g., a parent-child or spousal family relationship, an employee-employer relationship, a co-parent relationship, a fiance relationship, a combination
thereof, etc.) for at least one authorized user (e.g., an owner or permitted operator of an Apple iPhone) via at least one user-device interaction (e.g., a user visiting a location, a user ordering a good or service, a combination thereof, etc.). 
However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 804 may be directed at least partially to incorporating the at least one indication of personal relation into at least one behavioral fingerprint that is associated with the at least one authorized
user, the at least one behavioral fingerprint including one or more indicators of utilization of one or more user devices by the at least one authorized user.  For certain example implementations, at least one server device 112 may incorporate 712 (e.g.,
add, integrate, supplement with, establish links between or among individuals reflecting familial or other personal relations thereof, update using, augment with, replace with, modify using, adapt using, delete at least a portion of, change statistics
using, create at least one new predicted act based at least partially on, alter at least one existing predicted act based at least partially on, a combination thereof, etc.) at least one indication 706 of (e.g., a label, a categorization, a code, a tag,
an assignment, one or more words, an association, a combination thereof, etc. communicating or representing a) personal relation into at least one behavioral fingerprint 110 that is associated with at least one authorized user, with at least one
behavioral fingerprint 110 including one or more indicators 302-322 (e.g., one or more of any of indicators 302-322 of FIG. 3 as described herein above, including but not limited to predicted acts 322) of utilization 708 (e.g., accessing, using,
interacting with, carrying, moving from place to place, providing input to, receiving output from, communicating with, running apps on, requesting or completing or effecting transactions via, directing operation of, a combination thereof, etc.) of one or
more user devices 102 by at least one authorized user 104.  By way of example but not limitation, a service provider (e.g., an authentication service provider operating at least partially via the Internet, such as a Google web service) may incorporate
(e.g., add at least one piece of datum of, modify at least one entry based on, a combination thereof, etc.) at least one indication of personal relation (e.g., a label that may also be applicable for including as part of a contact entry) into at least
one behavioral fingerprint (e.g., a collection of observed or predicted acts or characteristics) that is associated with (e.g., that are inferred from, that are attributable to, that correspond to, a combination thereof, etc.) at least one authorized
user (e.g., an owner or registered user of an Android-based smart phone), with the at least one behavioral fingerprint including one or more indicators of utilization (e.g., one or more stored representations of how a user operates a user interface of an
Android device, an identification of one or more entities interacted with via the Android device, a listing of one or more purchases made with the Android device, or an enumeration of one or more locations visited using the Android device) of one or more
user devices (e.g., an Android-based mobile device such as a Samsung Galaxy smart phone) by the at least one authorized user.  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 8B-8L depict example additions or alternatives for a flow diagram of FIG. 8A in accordance with certain example embodiments.  As illustrated, flow diagrams of FIGS. 8B-8L may include any of the illustrated or described operations. 
Although operations are shown or described in a particular order or with a particular relationship to one or more other operations, it should be understood that methods may be performed in alternative manners without departing from claimed subject
matter, including, but not limited to, with a different order or number of operations or with a different relationship between or among operations (e.g., operations that are illustrated as nested blocks are not necessarily subsidiary operations and may
instead be performed independently).  Also, at least some operation(s) of flow diagrams of FIGS. 8B-8L may be performed so as to be fully or partially overlapping with other operation(s).
<br/><br/> FIG. 8B illustrates a flow diagram 800B having example operations 808, 810, 812, 814, 816, or 818.  For certain example embodiments, an operation 808 may be directed at least partially to wherein the inferring at least one indication of personal
relation for at least one authorized user via at least one user-device interaction (of operation 802) comprises monitoring one or more purchases by at least one user.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may monitor (e.g., observe,
detect, record, ascertain, store, analyze, a combination thereof, etc.) one or more purchases 726 (e.g., orders, in-person exchanges, trades for consideration, payments for value, a combination thereof, etc.) by at least one user (e.g., an authorized
user, a user approved by an authorized user, an unauthorized user, a user of unknown or indeterminate status, a combination thereof, etc.).  By way of example but not limitation, a retail company (e.g., Amazon) may monitor one or more purchases by at
least one user (e.g., may catalog or record a history of purchases as part of a behavioral fingerprint for a customer or for a user device).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations,
examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 810 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more purchases by at least one user (of operation 808) comprises monitoring one or more orders made by at least one user.  For
certain example implementations, at least one device may monitor one or more orders (e.g., one or more requests, demands, invoices, buy notices, a combination thereof, etc. for at least one good or service) made by at least one user.  By way of example
but not limitation, a server device (e.g., operated by Google) may monitor one or more orders made by at least one user (e.g., may record or organize orders made or consummated at least partially using Google Wallet).  However, claimed subject matter is
not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 812 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more orders made by at least one user (of operation 810) comprises detecting one or more requests for delivery of at least one
physical good by at least one user.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may detect (e.g., discover, determine, ascertain, learn through inspection, realize via notification, a combination thereof, etc.) one or more requests (e.g.,
one or more submissions, notifications, inquiries, asks for, solicitations, a combination thereof, etc.) for delivery (e.g., placement at a designated address, entry into shipping, a combination thereof, etc.) of at least one physical good (e.g., a
tangible item, personal property, something that may be touched or felt, a combination thereof, etc.) by at least one user.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of ebay) may detect one or more requests for delivery of at least
one physical good by at least one user (e.g., may store an agreement between a buyer and a seller to convey or ship a purchased physical item from the seller to the buyer).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described
embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 814 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more orders made by at least one user (of operation 810) comprises detecting one or more requests for delivery of at least one
virtual good by at least one user.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may detect (e.g., discover, determine, ascertain, learn through inspection, realize via notification, a combination thereof, etc.) one or more requests (e.g.,
one or more submissions, notifications, inquiries, asks for, solicitations, a combination thereof, etc.) for delivery (e.g., electronic transmission or reception, electronic display or audible presentation, a combination thereof, etc.) of at least one
virtual good (e.g., a movie, a song, an app, an e-book, an electronic edition of a magazine, an in-game item or ability, a non-physical good, an access capability to at least one feature, a status designation or qualification/membership level, a
combination thereof, etc.) by at least one user.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., for Apple iTunes) may detect one or more requests for delivery of at least one virtual good by at least one user (e.g., may realize or record
that a child's television show has been ordered for rental three times a week).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.

<br/><br/> FIG. 8C illustrates a flow diagram 800C having example operations 820, 822, or 824.  For certain example embodiments, an operation 820 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more purchases by at least one user (of
operation 808) comprises monitoring one or more in-person exchanges made by at least one user.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may monitor (e.g., observe, detect, record, ascertain, store, analyze, a combination thereof, etc.)
one or more in-person exchanges (e.g., in-store, face-to-face, at a business' premises, a combination thereof, etc. trade of consideration for at least one good or service) made by at least one user.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device
(e.g., of Walmart) may monitor one or more in-person exchanges made by at least one user (e.g., may store into a database purchases made through a checkout lane at a Walmart store).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular
described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 822 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more in-person exchanges made by at least one user (of operation 820) comprises detecting one or more acquisitions of at least
one physical good by at least one user.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may detect (e.g., discover, determine, ascertain, learn through inspection, realize via notification, a combination thereof, etc.) one or more acquisitions
(e.g., taking possession of, physically receiving, carrying away, a combination thereof, etc.) of at least one physical good (e.g., a tangible item, personal property, something that may be touched or felt, a combination thereof, etc.) by at least one

described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8D illustrates a flow diagram 800D having example operations 826, 828, 830, 832, or 834.  For certain example embodiments, an operation 826 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more purchases by at least one
user (of operation 808) comprises ascertaining at least one category of the one or more purchases made by the at least one user.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may ascertain (e.g., determine, acquire, divine, a combination
thereof, etc.) at least one category 728 (e.g., a topic; a subject-matter; a target-audience; a likely user of a good; a likely recipient of a service; a sub-topic; an age, gender, or other demographic attribute of a targeted customer; a combination
thereof; etc.) of one or more purchases 726 made by at least one user.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of Target) may ascertain at least one category of one or more purchases made by at least one user (e.g., a Target server
may categorize purchased goods into store areas, such as sporting goods or housewares, or into age-appropriateness, such as adult movies or children's clothing).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments,
implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 828 may be directed at least partially to wherein the ascertaining at least one category of the one or more purchases made by the at least one user (of operation 826) comprises comparing at least one
store name to one or more entries in at least one purchase categorization database.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may compare (e.g., determine similarities, determine differences, determine if there is a match, a combination
thereof, etc.) at least one store name (e.g., a legal name, a common name, a name on a sign, a corporate name, a combination thereof, etc.) to one or more entries (e.g., at least a part of one or more fields, blocks, variables, tables, indexes, a
combination thereof, etc.) in at least one purchase categorization database (e.g., a hierarchical, networked, relational, a combination thereof, etc. database that links store names to at least one corresponding category).  By way of example but not
limitation, a server device (e.g., of Visa) may compare at least one store name to one or more entries in at least one purchase categorization database (e.g., Visa may compare the names of stores at which a card holder has made purchases to determine
categories of shopping engaged in by the card holder).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 830 may be directed at least partially to wherein the ascertaining at least one category of the one or more purchases made by the at least one user (of operation 826) comprises comparing at least one
product identifier to one or more entries in at least one purchase categorization database.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may compare at least one product identifier (e.g., a product name, a product code (e.g., a universal
product code (UPC), a quick response (QR) code, a stock keeping unit (SKU), a combination thereof, etc.), a product alphanumeric designator, some combination thereof, etc.) to one or more entries (e.g., at least a part of one or more fields, blocks,
variables, tables, indexes, a combination thereof, etc.) in at least one purchase categorization database (e.g., a hierarchical, networked, relational, a combination thereof, etc. database that links product identifiers to at least one corresponding
category).  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of a grocery store such as Safeway) may compare at least one product identifier to one or more entries in at least one purchase categorization database (e.g., Safeway may compare
proprietary product codes or manufacturer product codes of groceries purchased by a Safeway Card holder to groceries identified in a database that includes corresponding consumer traits).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular
described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 832 may be directed at least partially to wherein the ascertaining at least one category of the one or more purchases made by the at least one user (of operation 826) comprises searching for at least
one association of at least one store name with one or more characteristics of store customers.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may search (e.g., analyze, review, inspect, a combination thereof, etc. tables, entries,
spreadsheets, data structures, databases, a combination thereof, etc.) for at least one association (e.g., a one-way linking, a two-way linking, a tuple, a relation, a combination thereof, etc.) of at least one store name (e.g., a legal name, a common
name, a name on a sign, a corporate name, a combination thereof, etc.) with one or more characteristics (e.g., demographic information such as age, gender, income level, education a combination thereof, etc.; preferred style attributes; category of
consumer; geographical location; likely related items that might be appealing; some combination thereof; and so forth) of store customers.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of Apple that operates at least partially to support
Passbook) may search for at least one association of at least one store name with one or more characteristics of store customers (e.g., may attempt to identify with reference to a data structure an income level associated with typical customers of
Restoration Hardware).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 834 may be directed at least partially to wherein the ascertaining at least one category of the one or more purchases made by the at least one user (of operation 826) comprises searching for at least
one association of at least one product identifier with one or more characteristics of product purchasers.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may search (e.g., analyze, review, inspect, a combination thereof, etc. tables, entries,
spreadsheets, data structures, databases, a combination thereof, etc.) for at least one association (e.g., a one-way linking, a two-way linking, a tuple, a relation, a combination thereof, etc.) of at least one product identifier (e.g., a product name, a
product code (e.g., a UPC, a QR code, a SKU, a combination thereof, etc.), a product alphanumeric designator, some combination thereof, etc.) with one or more characteristics (e.g., demographic information such as age, gender, income level, education a
combination thereof, etc.; preferred style attributes; category of consumer; geographical location; likely related items of interest; some combination thereof; and so forth) of product purchasers.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device
(e.g., of Limited Brands stores) may search for at least one association of at least one product identifier with one or more characteristics of product purchasers (e.g., may attempt to identify with reference to a data structure an age and gender
associated with typical purchasers of Bath &amp; Body Works-branded scented hand sanitizers).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8E illustrates a flow diagram 800E having example operations 836, 838, 840, 842, or 844.  For certain example embodiments, an operation 836 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more purchases by at least one
user (of operation 808) comprises deducing that at least one personal relation includes at least one child based at least partially on at least one purchase categorization.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may deduce (e.g.,
derive, conclude from evidence, determine, reason, surmise, glean, a combination thereof, etc.) that at least one personal relation (e.g., at least one person that is a legal or effective family member or that is a good friend of a family member)
includes at least one child (e.g., a person under 18, a teenager, a juvenile, an infant, a combination thereof, etc.) based at least partially on at least one purchase categorization (e.g., a category 728 applied to or associated with a purchase).  By
way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of a computer security company such a McAfee) may deduce that at least one personal relation includes at least one child based at least partially on at least one purchase categorization (e.g., may
deduce that a customer is close to a young boy based on repeated action figure purchases that are categorized as correspond to pre-teen boys).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations,
examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 838 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more purchases by at least one user (of operation 808) comprises deducing that at least one personal relation includes at least
one senior citizen based at least partially on at least one purchase categorization.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may deduce (e.g., derive, conclude from evidence, determine, reason, surmise, glean, a combination thereof,
etc.) that at least one personal relation (e.g., at least one person that is a legal or effective family member or that is a trusted professional associate) includes at least one senior citizen (e.g., a person over 55 years old, a person over 65 years
old, a person that is retired, a person that is eligible for age-based governmental benefits, a combination thereof, etc.) based at least partially on at least one purchase categorization (e.g., a category 728 applied to or associated with a purchase). 
By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of American Express) may deduce that at least one personal relation includes at least one senior citizen based at least partially on at least one purchase categorization (e.g., may deduce that
a customer with an age under 40 is close to a senior citizen based at least partly on a gift membership to AARP, which is categorized as corresponding to retired people).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described
embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 840 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more purchases by at least one user (of operation 808) comprises deducing that at least one personal relation includes at least
one female relation based at least partially on at least one purchase categorization.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may deduce (e.g., derive, conclude from evidence, determine, reason, surmise, glean, a combination thereof,
etc.) that at least one personal relation (e.g., at least one person that is a legal or effective family member or that is a trusted professional associate) includes at least one female relation based at least partially on at least one purchase
categorization (e.g., a category 728 applied to or associated with a purchase).  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of ProFlowers) may deduce that at least one personal relation includes at least one female relation based at
least partially on at least one purchase categorization (e.g., may deduce that a customer has a female relation because of annual flower or plant purchases around Mother's Day, which floral purchases that are contemporaneous with Mother's Day being
categorized as corresponding to women).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 842 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more purchases by at least one user (of operation 842) comprises deducing that at least one personal relation includes at least
one male relation based at least partially on at least one purchase categorization.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may deduce (e.g., derive, conclude from evidence, determine, reason, surmise, glean, a combination thereof,
etc.) that at least one personal relation (e.g., at least one person that is a legal or effective family member or that is a trusted professional associate) includes at least one male relation based at least partially on at least one purchase
categorization (e.g., a category 728 applied to or associated with a purchase).  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of MasterCard) may deduce that at least one personal relation includes at least one male relation based at least
partially on at least one purchase categorization (e.g., may deduce that a credit card customer has a male relation because of occasional purchases of fishing equipment, which fishing equipment purchases are categorized as corresponding to men, when
other purchases are predominately categorized as corresponding to women).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 844 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more purchases by at least one user (of operation 808) comprises deducing at least one personal relation based at least partly
on the one or more purchases.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may deduce (e.g., derive, conclude from evidence, determine, reason, surmise, glean, a combination thereof, etc.) at least one personal relation (e.g., at least one
person that is a legal or effective family member or that is a trusted confidant or confidante) based at least partly on one or more purchases.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of Google that supports Google Wallet) may
deduce at least one personal relation based at least partly on one or more purchases (e.g., may deduce that two people are close friends if they live apart but purchase lunch at the same location within seconds of each other three to four times a week). 
However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8F illustrates a flow diagram 800F having example operations 846a, 846b, 848, 850, or 852.  For certain example embodiments, an operation 846a and an operation 846b may be directed at least partially to wherein the inferring at least one
indication of personal relation for at least one authorized user via at least one user-device interaction (of operation 802) comprises: inferring at least one personal relation of the at least one authorized user based at least partly on the at least one
user-device interaction (for operation 846a) and formulating the at least one indication of personal relation responsive to the at least one inferred personal relation (for operation 846b).  For certain example implementations, at least one device may
infer (e.g., deduce, ascertain, derive, conclude an existence of, glean, surmise, discover, determine, a combination thereof, etc.) at least one personal relation (e.g., at least one person that is a legal or effective family member or that is a trusted
professional associate or confidant) of at least one authorized user based at least partly on at least one user-device interaction 710 (e.g., at least one interaction (e.g., a user inputting or sending data or information into or to a device, a user
selecting from between or among options provided or offered by a device, a user submitting a request to a device, a user responding to an inquiry from a device, a user viewing or otherwise visiting one or more internet locations via a device, a user
entering one or more search terms via a device, a user making one or more purchases via a device, a user visiting one or more physical locations with a device, a combination thereof, etc.) between or among at least one user (e.g., an authorized user, an
unauthorized user, a user that is authorized by designation, a combination thereof, etc.) and one or more devices (e.g., a user device 102, a server device 112, a combination thereof, etc.)) and may formulate at least one indication of personal relation
706 (e.g., one or more indications representing one or more familial relations (e.g., legal, biological, marital, family-in-law such as mother-in-law, parent-child, natural parent-child, adopted parent-child, daughter, uncle, spouse, domestic partner,
significant other, boyfriend, girlfriend, partner, a combination thereof, etc.), representing one or more trust relations (e.g., attorney, doctor, nanny, babysitter, god parent, accountant, personal assistant, best friend, a combination thereof, etc.),
representing one or more intimate relations (e.g., boyfriend, girlfriend, significant other, partner, fiance, spouse, domestic partner, a combination thereof, etc.), representing one or more employment or professional relations (e.g., employer, employee,
contractor, boss, a combination thereof, etc.), some combination thereof, etc. between or among at least one authorized user and one or more individuals) responsive to at least one inferred personal relation.  By way of example but not limitation, a
server device (e.g., of Amazon) may infer at least one personal relation of at least one authorized user based at least partly on at least one user-device interaction (e.g., may infer that a person is a nephew of a customer based on a gift card order
coupled with a message including a phrase "favorite nephew") and may formulate at least one indication of personal relation responsive to at least one inferred personal relation (e.g., may create a tag or data structure, may append a label to an existing
data structure such as a customer profile, a combination thereof, etc. that connotes that a customer has a nephew, without or without an explicit identification of the nephew).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described
embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 848 may be directed at least partially to wherein the formulating the at least one indication of personal relation responsive to the at least one inferred personal relation (of operation 846b)
comprises preparing the at least one indication of personal relation in accordance with at least one behavioral fingerprint format.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may prepare (e.g., create from scratch, amend an existing,
append to a previous, a combination thereof, etc.) at least one indication of personal relation 706 in accordance with at least one behavioral fingerprint format (e.g., a proprietary or standardized approach to terms or organization of a behavioral
fingerprint or portion thereof).  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of Amazon) may prepare at least one indication of personal relation in accordance with at least one behavioral fingerprint format (e.g., may add a nephew entry
to a relations portion of a customer profile in a proprietary format).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 850 may be directed at least partially to wherein the preparing the at least one indication of personal relation in accordance with at least one behavioral fingerprint format (of operation 848)
comprises including at least one likelihood with the at least one indication of personal relation for the at least one behavioral fingerprint.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may include (e.g., may add, insert, append, comprise,
have, a combination thereof, etc.) at least one likelihood (e.g., a probability, a prediction, an estimation of accuracy, an expectation of correctness, a potentiality, a percentage, a range, a statistical value, a combination thereof, etc.) with at
least one indication 706 of personal relation (e.g., at least one person that is a legal or effective family member or that is a trusted professional associate or confidante) for at least one behavioral fingerprint 110.  By way of example but not
limitation, a server device (e.g., of Amazon) may include at least one likelihood with at least one indication of personal relation for at least one behavioral fingerprint (e.g., may insert a statistical value into a behavioral fingerprint indicating a
confidence that a nephew relation has been correctly inferred).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 852 may be directed at least partially to wherein the inferring at least one indication of personal relation for at least one authorized user via at least one user-device interaction (of operation
802) comprises receiving at least a representation of the at least one user-device interaction.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may receive (e.g., wirelessly or by wire from a user device; a server device; an intermediate
device, such as a cash register machine; a combination thereof; etc.) at least a representation of (e.g., a description of, a reference to, a code identifying, a summary of, a snapshot of, a combination thereof, etc.) at least one user-device interaction
710 (e.g., at least one interaction (e.g., a user inputting or sending data or information into or to a device, a user selecting from between or among options provided or offered by a device, a user submitting a request to a device, a user responding to
an inquiry from a device, a user contacting one or more internet destinations via a device, a user entering one or more search terms via a device, a user making one or more purchases via a device, a user visiting one or more physical locations with a
device, a combination thereof, etc.) between or among at least one user (e.g., an authorized user, an unauthorized user, a user that is authorized by designation, a combination thereof, etc.) and one or more devices (e.g., a user device 102, a server
device 112, a combination thereof, etc.)).  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., a server providing iCloud services to Apple itself or to its customers) may receive at least a representation of at least one user-device interaction
(e.g., may receive from an iPhone a description of a POS purchase made using the iPhone, with the description including a vendor, a purchased item, a cost of the purchased item, a location of the purchase, a combination thereof, etc.).  However, claimed
subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8G illustrates a flow diagram 800G having example operations 854, 856, 858, 860, 862, or 864.  For certain example embodiments, an operation 854 may be directed at least partially to wherein the inferring at least one indication of personal
relation for at least one authorized user via at least one user-device interaction (of operation 802) comprises monitoring one or more locations visited by at least one user.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may monitor (e.g.,
observe, detect, record, ascertain, determine, store, analyze, a combination thereof, etc.) one or more locations 730 (e.g., a virtual location--such as a website, internet-connected server, virtual world, or virtual world location; a physical
location--such as an address, GPS coordinates, or an identifiable place like a neighborhood or friend's home; a combination thereof; etc.) visited (e.g., at least partially rendered, displayed, viewed, downloaded, printed, streamed from,
electronically-contacted, information retrieved from, information provided to, physically traveling to, being present at, arriving at, checking in at, meeting a person at, a combination thereof, etc.) by at least one user.  By way of example but not
limitation, a server device (e.g., of Google) may monitor one or more locations visited by at least one user (e.g., may recognize or store for future use a destination to which a person arrives, such as an address or GPS coordinates).  However, claimed
subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 856 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more locations visited by at least one user (of operation 854) comprises determining if the one or more locations visited by
the at least one user are appropriate for a youth.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may determine (e.g., ascertain, figure out, discern, discover, divine, a combination thereof, etc.) if one or more locations 730 (e.g., an
address, a place, SPS coordinates, a physical location, a combination thereof, etc.) visited (e.g., physically traveled to, being present at, arriving at, checking in at, meeting a person at, a combination thereof, etc.) by at least one user are
appropriate for a youth (e.g., are where young people frequent, are not dangerous for young people, are not unlawful for those under 21, are attractive or popular to people under 18, are places to which children are required to attend, a combination
thereof, etc.).  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of an electronic security company such as Norton) may determine if one or more locations visited by at least one user are appropriate for a youth (e.g., may determine if or
whether a location is a school, a daycare, a pediatrician's office, a store that caters to kids, etc.).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 858 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more locations visited by at least one user (of operation 854) comprises deducing that at least one personal relation includes
at least one child based at least partially on a determination that the one or more locations visited by the at least one user are appropriate for a youth.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may deduce (e.g., derive, conclude from
evidence, determine, reason, surmise, glean, a combination thereof, etc.) that at least one personal relation (e.g., at least one person that is a legal or effective family member or that is a ward of a user) includes at least one child (e.g., a person
under 18, a teenager, a juvenile, an infant, a combination thereof, etc.) based at least partially on a determination (e.g., a decision, an ascertainment, a discovery, a combination thereof, etc.) that one or more locations 730 visited by at least one
user are appropriate for a youth (e.g., are where young people frequent, are not dangerous, are not unlawful for people under 21, are attractive or popular to people under 18, are places to which children are required to attend, a combination thereof,
etc.).  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., an Apple server receiving location data from an iPhone) may deduce that at least one personal relation includes at least one child based at least partially on a determination that the
one or more locations visited by the at least one user are appropriate for a youth (e.g., may determine that an Apple account holder has responsibility for a child aged approximately 5-10 because the user visits an elementary school every morning between
8:00 and 8:10 am).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 860 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more locations visited by at least one user (of operation 854) comprises detecting a visitation pattern with the one or more
locations visited by the at least one user.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may detect (e.g., discover, determine, ascertain, learn through inspection or analysis, realize via notification, a combination thereof, etc.) a
visitation pattern (e.g., a recurrence of visitations, a repetition in time such as daily or weekly, a repetition in space such as a particular store or neighborhood, a combination thereof, etc.) with one or more locations 730 (e.g., postal addresses;
GPS coordinates; identifiable places like a business, a neighborhood, or a relative's home; a combination thereof; etc.) visited by at least one user.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., for Apple in conjunction with Maps or
Passbook) may detect a visitation pattern with one or more locations visited by at least one user (e.g., may detect from GPS coordinates received from a user's iPhone that the user utilizes a particular Starbucks drive thru each weekday morning). 
However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 862 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more locations visited by at least one user (of operation 854) comprises determining if the one or more locations visited by
the at least one user are appropriate for a senior citizen.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may determine (e.g., ascertain, figure out, discern, discover, divine, a combination thereof, etc.) if one or more locations 730 (e.g.,
an address, a place, SPS coordinates, a physical location, a combination thereof, etc.) visited by at least one user are appropriate for a senior citizen (e.g., a person over 55 years old, a person over 65 years old, a person that is retired, a person
that is eligible for age-based governmental benefits, a combination thereof, etc.).  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of Bank of America for a debit card or checking draft system) may determine if one or more locations visited
by at least one user are appropriate for a senior citizen (e.g., may determine if or whether a location is a senior citizen center, a business catering to senior citizens, an assisted living facility, a medical practice that accepts Medicare, a
combination thereof, etc.).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 864 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more locations visited by at least one user (of operation 854) comprises deducing that at least one personal relation includes
at least one grandparent based at least partially on a determination that the one or more locations visited by the at least one user are appropriate for a senior citizen.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may deduce (e.g., derive,
conclude from evidence, determine, reason, surmise, glean, a combination thereof, etc.) that at least one personal relation (e.g., at least one person that is a legal or effective family member) includes at least one grandparent based at least partially
on a determination (e.g., a decision, an ascertainment, a discovery, a combination thereof, etc.) that one or more locations 730 visited by at least one user are appropriate for a senior citizen (e.g., are where senior citizens frequent, provide goods or
services targeted toward senior citizens, are places at which senior citizens live, a combination thereof, etc.).  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of a payments company such as PayPal) may deduce that at least one personal
relation includes at least one grandparent based at least partially on a determination that one or more locations visited by at least one user are appropriate for a senior citizen (e.g., may determine that a PayPal account holder has a grandparent, and
thus that funds may be expended on goods or services appropriate for a senior citizen, if the account holder parks at a senior citizen's center each Tuesday and Thursday at 11 am and 2 pm for 8-12 minutes).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited
to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8H illustrates a flow diagram 800H having example operations 866, 868, 870, or 872.  For certain example embodiments, an operation 866 may be directed at least partially to wherein the monitoring one or more locations visited by at least
one user (of operation 854) comprises ascertaining demographic data for patrons corresponding to the one or more locations visited by the at least one user.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may ascertain (e.g., determine,
acquire, divine, a combination thereof, etc.) demographic data (e.g., age, gender, income level, education level, likely interests, vocations, avocations, possible preferences, a combination thereof, etc.) for patrons (e.g., customers, potential
customers, people perusing or considering offered goods or services, visitors, clients, people enjoying a locale or establishment or area, a combination thereof, etc.) corresponding to one or more locations 730 (e.g., an address, a place, SPS
coordinates, a physical location, a series of physical locations, a path, an area, a combination thereof, etc.) visited (e.g., physically traveled to, being present at, arrived at, checking in at, meeting a person at, a combination thereof, etc.) by at
least one user.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of Apple) may ascertain demographic data for patrons corresponding to one or more locations visited by at least one user (e.g., may retrieve demographic data from a proprietary
or public database for people who shop at Pier One if the user is detected to be shopping at a Pier One location based on location data reported by an iPhone).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments,
implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 868 may be directed at least partially to wherein the ascertaining demographic data for patrons corresponding to the one or more locations visited by the at least one user (of operation 866)
comprises obtaining the demographic data for the patrons corresponding to the one or more locations visited by the at least one user responsive at least partly to one or more geographic coordinates associated with the one or more locations.  For certain
example implementations, at least one device may obtain (e.g., secure, retrieve, extract, ascertain, a combination thereof, etc.) demographic data for patrons corresponding to one or more locations 730 visited by at least one user responsive at least
partly to one or more geographic coordinates (e.g., map coordinates such as degrees or miles, satellite positioning system (SPS) coordinates, a combination thereof, etc.) associated with the one or more locations.  By way of example but not limitation, a
server device (e.g., of Starbucks) may obtain demographic data for patrons corresponding to one or more locations visited by at least one user responsive at least partly to one or more geographic coordinates associated with the one or more locations
(e.g., after receiving particular GPS coordinates from a Starbucks app on an Android phone, a Starbucks server may acquire demographic data for patrons of a business corresponding to the GPS coordinates).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited
to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 870 may be directed at least partially to wherein the ascertaining demographic data for patrons corresponding to the one or more locations visited by the at least one user (of operation 866)
comprises obtaining the demographic data for the patrons corresponding to the one or more locations visited by the at least one user responsive at least partly to one or more physical postal addresses associated with the one or more locations.  For
certain example implementations, at least one device may obtain (e.g., secure, retrieve, extract, ascertain, a combination thereof, etc.) demographic data for patrons corresponding to one or more locations 730 visited by at least one user responsive at
least partly to one or more physical postal addresses (e.g., street name, street number, city name, postal code such as ZIP code, a combination thereof, etc.) associated with one or more locations.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device
(e.g., of Google) may obtain demographic data for patrons corresponding to one or more locations visited by at least one user responsive at least partly to one or more physical postal addresses associated with the one or more locations (e.g., after
receiving a physical postal address from a browser-based map search, a Google server may acquire demographic data for patrons of an establishment corresponding to the postal address).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular
described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 872 may be directed at least partially to wherein the ascertaining demographic data for patrons corresponding to the one or more locations visited by the at least one user (of operation 866)
comprises obtaining the demographic data for the patrons corresponding to the one or more locations visited by the at least one user responsive at least partly to one or more place names associated with the one or more locations.  For certain example
implementations, at least one device may obtain (e.g., secure, retrieve, extract, ascertain, a combination thereof, etc.) demographic data for patrons corresponding to one or more locations 730 visited by at least one user responsive at least partly to
one or more place names (e.g., a neighborhood name, a landmark name, a store name, a museum name, a governmental site name, a city name, a school name, a building name, a business establishment name, a name of an entertainment area, a tourist attraction
name, a combination thereof, etc.) associated with the one or more locations.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of Apple) may obtain demographic data for patrons corresponding to one or more locations visited by at least one
user responsive at least partly to one or more place names associated with the one or more locations (e.g., after receiving a particular place name via Siri for a map feature of an iPhone, an Apple server may acquire demographic data for patrons of a
location corresponding to the place name "Metropolitan Museum of Art").  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8I illustrates a flow diagram 800I having example operations 874, 876, 878, or 880.  For certain example embodiments, an operation 874 may be directed at least partially to wherein the inferring at least one indication of personal relation
for at least one authorized user via at least one user-device interaction (of operation 802) comprises inferring the at least one indication of personal relation based at least partially on one or more communications that occur on a particular day.  For
certain example implementations, at least one device may infer (e.g., deduce, ascertain, derive, conclude an existence of, glean, surmise, discover, determine, a combination thereof, etc.) at least one indication of personal relation 706 (e.g., at least
one person that is a legal or effective family member or that is a trusted associate or friend) based at least partially on one or more communications 724 (e.g., a text message, a phone call, an email, a social network communication, a transcribed video
call, a chat, a combination thereof, etc.) that occur on a particular day (e.g., a day having an identifiable noteworthiness generally or contextually based at least partly on the parties to a communication).  By way of example but not limitation, a
server device (e.g., associated with a security company such as Kaspersky that may also has software executing on a user device) may infer at least one indication of personal relation based at least partially on one or more communications that occur on a
particular day (e.g., may infer that one or more persons called on a non work day, such as Saturday or a Sunday, are at least also personal contacts).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments,
implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 876 may be directed at least partially to wherein the inferring the at least one indication of personal relation based at least partially on one or more communications that occur on a particular day
(of operation 874) comprises inferring the at least one indication of personal relation based at least partially on the particular day being associated with a holiday.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may infer at least one
indication of personal relation 706 based at least partially on a particular day being associated with a holiday (e.g., a legal holiday, a regional holiday, a national or world-recognized holiday, a commercial holiday, a combination thereof, etc.).  By
way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of Hallmark) may infer at least one indication of personal relation based at least partially on a particular day being associated with a holiday (e.g., may infer that women called on Mother's Day
are female family relations with children and likely a mother or grandmother of a calling party).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 878 may be directed at least partially to wherein the inferring the at least one indication of personal relation based at least partially on one or more communications that occur on a particular day
(of operation 874) comprises inferring the at least one indication of personal relation based at least partially on at least one length of the one or more communications.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may infer at least one
indication 706 of personal relation based at least partially on at least one length of one or more communications.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of a discount deals company such as Groupon) may infer at least one
indication of personal relation based at least partially on at least one length of one or more communications (e.g., may infer that an individual is a grandparent of an authorized user if a longer-than-average phone call to the individual occurs on
Grandparent's Day).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 880 may be directed at least partially to wherein the inferring the at least one indication of personal relation based at least partially on one or more communications that occur on a particular day
(of operation 874) comprises inferring the at least one indication of personal relation based at least partially on at least one recurrence pattern of the one or more communications.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may infer at
least one indication of personal relation 706 based at least partially on at least one recurrence pattern (e.g., a daily repetition, a weekly repetition on a same day each week, a repetition on a given holiday, a combination thereof, etc.) of one or more
communications.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of Verizon) may infer at least one indication of personal relation based at least partially on at least one recurrence pattern of one or more communications (e.g., may infer
that two people are close friends when one texts the other early in the day each year on the other's birthday).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8J illustrates a flow diagram 800J having example operations 882 or 884.  For certain example embodiments, an operation 882 may be directed at least partially to wherein the inferring at least one indication of personal relation for at
least one authorized user via at least one user-device interaction (of operation 802) comprises ascertaining a certainty level to associate with the at least one indication of personal relation.  For certain example implementations, at least one device
may ascertain (e.g., determine, acquire, divine, a combination thereof, etc.) a certainty level (e.g., a qualitative indication, a relative ranking, a label that corresponds to one of multiple levels of confidence, a combination thereof, etc.) to
associate (e.g., tag, link, annotate, include, label, a combination thereof, etc.) with at least one indication 706 of personal relation.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of Apple) may ascertain a certainty level to associate
with at least one indication of personal relation (e.g., may ascertain that an inferred sibling relationship is to be tagged with a "fairly likely" or blue certainty level unless or until an additional user-device interaction causes the certainty level
to be raised to "very likely" or green).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 884 may be directed at least partially to wherein the inferring at least one indication of personal relation for at least one authorized user via at least one user-device interaction (of operation
802) comprises ascertaining a reliability indicator corresponding to the at least one inferred indication of personal relation.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may ascertain (e.g., determine, acquire, divine, a combination
thereof, etc.) a reliability indicator (e.g., a quantitative indication, a numerical value, a probability, a range, a likelihood estimate, a confidence interval, a credible interval, a statistical value, a statistical range, a combination thereof, etc.)
corresponding to at least one inferred indication of personal relation 706.  By way of example but not limitation, a server device (e.g., of Google) may ascertain a reliability indicator corresponding to at least one inferred indication of personal
relation (e.g., may determine a confidence interval from calculations used to infer that a contacted individual is a trusted friend).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8K illustrates a flow diagram 800K having example operations 886, 888, or 890.  For certain example embodiments, an operation 886 may be directed at least partially to wherein the inferring at least one indication of personal relation for
at least one authorized user via at least one user-device interaction (of operation 802) comprises obtaining the at least one indication of personal relation for the at least one authorized user via at least one social networking user-device interaction
from at least one social network.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may obtain at least one indication of personal relation 706 for at least one authorized user via at least one social networking user-device interaction 710 from
at least one social network 718 (e.g., a network, a service, a website, a computing infrastructure, an application, an interface, cloud computing, a combination thereof, etc. that enables or facilitates interaction (e.g., via text, images, audio, video,
a combination thereof, etc.) between or among two or more members).  By way of example but not limitation, a cloud-based service (e.g., a service from a debit card provider such as Bank of America) may obtain at least one indication of personal relation
(e.g., an indication of the existence of an aunt) for at least one authorized user via at least one social networking user-device interaction (e.g., a message sent between or among at least two friends via a user device) from at least one social network
(e.g., from <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or Myspace).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 888 may be directed at least partially to wherein the obtaining the at least one indication of personal relation for the at least one authorized user via at least one social networking user-device
interaction from at least one social network (of operation 886) comprises obtaining the at least one indication of personal relation for the at least one authorized user from the at least one social network from profile data that is associated with an
account for the at least one authorized user with the at least one social network.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may obtain at least one indication 706 of personal relation for at least one authorized user from at least one
social network 718 from profile data 720 that is associated with an account for the at least one authorized user with the at least one social network.  By way of example but not limitation, a web-based service (e.g., a service such as PayPal that may
offer payment authentication services) may obtain at least one indication of personal relation (e.g., a spouse, a first child's name, a second child's name, etc.) for at least one authorized user from at least one social network (e.g., <b><i>Facebook</i></b>) from
profile data (e.g., demographic or other data that may be provided if the authorized user establishes a <b><i>Facebook</i></b> account) that is associated with an account (e.g., identifiable by a username such as an email or phone number) for the at least one
authorized user with the at least one social network.  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 890 may be directed at least partially to wherein the obtaining the at least one indication of personal relation for the at least one authorized user via at least one social networking user-device
interaction from at least one social network (of operation 886) comprises retrieving the at least one indication of personal relation for the at least one authorized user from at least a part of one or more servers operated by or for the at least one
social network.  For certain example implementations, at least one device (e.g., at least one server 112(2)) may retrieve at least one indication 706 of personal relation for at least one authorized user from at least a part (e.g., from a single physical
or virtual server, from a distributed server, from a part of a server farm, from multiple servers, a combination thereof, etc.) of one or more servers (e.g., at least one server 112(1)) operated by or for at least one social network 718.  By way of
example but not limitation, at least one server device (e.g., an actual or virtual server of a cloud service such as Apple's iCloud) may retrieve at least one indication of personal relation for at least one authorized user from at least a part of one or
more servers operated by or for at least one social network (e.g., from one or more servers operated for or by Classmates[dot]com).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8L illustrates a flow diagram 800L having example operations 892, 894, 896, 897, 898, or 899.  For certain example embodiments, an operation 892 may be directed at least partially to wherein the inferring at least one indication of personal
relation for at least one authorized user via at least one user-device interaction (of operation 802) comprises obtaining the at least one indication of personal relation for the at least one authorized user via at least one social networking user-device
interaction from at least one social network application.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may obtain at least one indication 706 of personal relation for at least one authorized user via at least one social networking

authorized user via at least one communication-related user-device interaction from at least one communication (e.g., an identity of a housekeeper may be obtained from an outgoing text message).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any
particular described embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 897 may be directed at least partially to wherein the obtaining the at least one indication of personal relation for the at least one authorized user via at least one communication-related
user-device interaction from at least one communication (of operation 896) comprises obtaining the at least one indication of personal relation for the at least one authorized user via at least one social networking user-device interaction from at least
one social network communication.  For certain example implementations, at least one device may obtain at least one indication of personal relation 706 for at least one authorized user via at least one social networking user-device interaction from at
least one social network communication (e.g., a message, a tweet, a post, a pin, a picture, a video, wall writing, streamed items, news items, a continuous or intermittent transmission or reception of information to or from a social network, a
combination thereof, etc.).  By way of example but not limitation, a cloud-based payment authorization service (e.g., PayPal) may obtain at least one indication of personal relation (e.g., a new addition to a family) for at least one authorized user via
at least one social networking user-device interaction from at least one social network communication (e.g., PayPal may obtain a name or existence of a new child for a customer responsive to a tweeted birth announcement).  However, claimed subject matter

<br/><br/> FIGS. 9A-9G depict example additions or alternatives for a flow diagram of FIG. 8A in accordance with certain example embodiments.  As illustrated, flow diagrams of FIGS. 9A-9G may include any of the illustrated or described operations. 
Although operations are shown or described in a particular order or with a particular relationship to one or more other operations, it should be understood that methods may be performed in alternative manners without departing from claimed subject
matter, including, but not limited to, with a different order or number of operations or with a different relationship between or among operations (e.g., operations that are illustrated as nested blocks are not necessarily subsidiary operations and may
instead be performed independently).  Also, at least some operation(s) of flow diagrams of FIGS. 9A-9G may be performed so as to be fully or partially overlapping with other operation(s).
<br/><br/> FIG. 9A illustrates a flow diagram 900A having example operations 908, 910, 911, 912, or 914.  For certain example embodiments, an operation 908 may be directed at least partially to wherein the incorporating the at least one indication of
personal relation into at least one behavioral fingerprint that is associated with the at least one authorized user, the at least one behavioral fingerprint including one or more indicators of utilization of one or more user devices by the at least one
authorized user, (of operation 804) comprises adding the at least one indication of personal relation to the at least one behavioral fingerprint that is associated with the at least one authorized user.  For certain example implementations, at least one
device may add (e.g., augment, insert, include, supplement, append, join together, a combination thereof, etc.) at least one indication of personal relation 706 to at least one behavioral fingerprint 110 that is associated with at least one authorized
user.  By way of example but not limitation, an internet or cloud-based security service may add at least one indication of personal relation (e.g., an Apple iCloud server may insert an identification of a child) to at least one behavioral fingerprint
that is associated with at least one authorized user (e.g., a behavioral fingerprint portion of an Apple ID profile stored at an Apple server farm).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments, implementations,
examples, etc.
<br/><br/> For certain example embodiments, an operation 910 may be directed at least partially to wherein the incorporating the at least one indication of personal relation into at least one behavioral fingerprint that is associated with the at least one
authorized user, the at least one behavioral fingerprint including one or more indicators of utilization of one or more user devices by the at least one authorized user, (of operation 804) comprises updating the at least one behavioral fingerprint that

location--such as an address, coordinates, or an identifiable place like a neighborhood or friend's home; a combination thereof; etc.) by the at least one authorized user with regard to one or more user devices.  By way of example but not limitation, an
OS of a Sony PC (e.g., Microsoft's Windows 8 of a Sony Vaio) may incorporate at least one indication of personal relation into at least one behavioral fingerprint that is associated with at least one authorized user, with the at least one behavioral
fingerprint including one or more indicators of at least one location visited by the at least one authorized user with regard to one or more user devices (e.g., an OS having security features, which may expose an authentication API to an app, may
incorporate at least one personal relation indication into a behavioral fingerprint that includes a list of a person's daily destinations to which a user device is carried).  However, claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described
embodiments, implementations, examples, etc.
<br/><br/> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the foregoing specific exemplary processes and/or devices and/or technologies are representative of more general processes and/or devices and/or technologies taught elsewhere herein, such as in the
claims filed herewith and/or elsewhere in the present application.
<br/><br/> Those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between hardware, software, and/or firmware implementations of aspects of systems; the use of hardware,
software, and/or firmware is generally (but not always, in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant) a design choice representing cost vs.  efficiency tradeoffs.  Those having skill in the art will
appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and/or systems and/or other technologies described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and/or firmware), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the
processes and/or systems and/or other technologies are deployed.  For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and/or firmware vehicle; alternatively, if flexibility is
paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and/or firmware.  Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes
and/or devices and/or other technologies described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific
concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary.  Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will typically employ optically-oriented hardware, software, and or
firmware.
<br/><br/> In some implementations described herein, logic and similar implementations may include software or other control structures.  Electronic circuitry, for example, may have one or more paths of electrical current constructed and arranged to
implement various functions as described herein.  In some implementations, one or more media may be configured to bear a device-detectable implementation when such media hold or transmit device detectable instructions operable to perform as described
herein.  In some variants, for example, implementations may include an update or modification of existing software or firmware, or of gate arrays or programmable hardware, such as by performing a reception of or a transmission of one or more instructions
in relation to one or more operations described herein.  Alternatively or additionally, in some variants, an implementation may include special-purpose hardware, software, firmware components, and/or general-purpose components executing or otherwise
invoking special-purpose components.  Specifications or other implementations may be transmitted by one or more instances of tangible transmission media as described herein, optionally by packet transmission or otherwise by passing through distributed
media at various times.
<br/><br/> Alternatively or additionally, implementations may include executing a special-purpose instruction sequence or invoking circuitry for enabling, triggering, coordinating, requesting, or otherwise causing one or more occurrences of virtually any
functional operations described herein.  In some variants, operational or other logical descriptions herein may be expressed as source code and compiled or otherwise invoked as an executable instruction sequence.  In some contexts, for example,
implementations may be provided, in whole or in part, by source code, such as C++, or other code sequences.  In other implementations, source or other code implementation, using commercially available and/or techniques in the art, may be
compiled/implemented/translated/converted into a high-level descriptor language (e.g., initially implementing described technologies in C or C++ programming language and thereafter converting the programming language implementation into a
logic-synthesizable language implementation, a hardware description language implementation, a hardware design simulation implementation, and/or other such similar mode(s) of expression).  For example, some or all of a logical expression (e.g., computer
programming language implementation) may be manifested as a Verilog-type hardware description (e.g., via Hardware Description Language (HDL) and/or Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Descriptor Language (VHDL)) or other circuitry model which may
then be used to create a physical implementation having hardware (e.g., an Application Specific Integrated Circuit).  Those skilled in the art will recognize how to obtain, configure, and optimize suitable transmission or computational elements, material
supplies, actuators, or other structures in light of these teachings.
<br/><br/> The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and/or processes via the use of block diagrams, flowcharts, and/or examples.  Insofar as such block diagrams, flowcharts, and/or examples contain one or more
functions and/or operations, it will be understood by those within the art that each function and/or operation within such block diagrams, flowcharts, or examples can be implemented, individually and/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware,
software, firmware, or virtually any combination thereof.  In one embodiment, several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), digital
signal processors (DSPs), or other integrated formats.  However, those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein, in whole or in part, can be equivalently implemented in integrated circuits, as one or more
computer programs running on one or more computers (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems), as one or more programs running on one or more processors (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors),
as firmware, or as virtually any combination thereof, and that designing the circuitry and/or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure.  In addition, those
skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies
regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution.  Examples of a signal bearing medium include, but are not limited to, the following: a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk, a hard disk
drive, a Compact Disc (CD), a Digital Video Disk (DVD), a digital tape, a computer memory, etc.; and a transmission type medium such as a digital and/or an analog communication medium (e.g., a fiber optic cable, a waveguide, a wired communications link,
a wireless communication link (e.g., transmitter, receiver, transmission logic, reception logic, etc.), etc.).
<br/><br/> In a general sense, those skilled in the art will recognize that the various aspects described herein which can be implemented, individually and/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, and/or any combination thereof can
be viewed as being composed of various types of "electrical circuitry." Consequently, as used herein "electrical circuitry" includes, but is not limited to, electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having
at least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific integrated circuit, electrical circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer
configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices described herein),
electrical circuitry forming a memory device (e.g., forms of memory (e.g., random access, flash, read only, etc.)), and/or electrical circuitry forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, optical-electrical equipment, etc.). 
Those having skill in the art will recognize that the subject matter described herein may be implemented in an analog or digital fashion or some combination thereof.
<br/><br/> Those skilled in the art will recognize that at least a portion of the devices and/or processes described herein can be integrated into a data processing system.  Those having skill in the art will recognize that a data processing system
generally includes one or more of a system unit housing, a video display device, memory such as volatile or non-volatile memory, processors such as microprocessors or digital signal processors, computational entities such as operating systems, drivers,
graphical user interfaces, and applications programs, one or more interaction devices (e.g., a touch pad, a touch screen, an antenna, etc.), and/or control systems including feedback loops and control motors (e.g., feedback for sensing position and/or
velocity; control motors for moving and/or adjusting components and/or quantities).  A data processing system may be implemented utilizing suitable commercially available components, such as those typically found in data computing/communication and/or
network computing/communication systems.
<br/><br/> For the purposes of this application, "cloud" computing may be understood as described in the cloud computing literature.  For example, cloud computing may be methods and/or systems for the delivery of computational capacity and/or storage
capacity as a service.  The "cloud" may refer to one or more hardware and/or software components that deliver or assist in the delivery of computational and/or storage capacity, including, but not limited to, one or more of a client, an application, a
platform, an infrastructure, and/or a server The cloud may refer to any of the hardware and/or software associated with a client, an application, a platform, an infrastructure, and/or a server.  For example, cloud and cloud computing may refer to one or
more of a computer, a processor, a storage medium, a router, a switch, a modem, a virtual machine (e.g., a virtual server), a data center, an operating system, a middleware, a firmware, a hardware back-end, a software back-end, and/or a software
application.  A cloud may refer to a private cloud, a public cloud, a hybrid cloud, and/or a community cloud.  A cloud may be a shared pool of configurable computing resources, which may be public, private, semi-private, distributable, scaleable,
flexible, temporary, virtual, and/or physical.  A cloud or cloud service may be delivered over one or more types of network, e.g., a mobile communication network, and the Internet.
<br/><br/> As used in this application, a cloud or a cloud service may include one or more of infrastructure-as-a-service ("IaaS"), platform-as-a-service ("PaaS"), software-as-a-service ("SaaS"), and/or desktop-as-a-service ("DaaS").  As a non-exclusive
example, IaaS may include, e.g., one or more virtual server instantiations that may start, stop, access, and/or configure virtual servers and/or storage centers (e.g., providing one or more processors, storage space, and/or network resources on-demand,
e.g., EMC and Rackspace).  PaaS may include, e.g., one or more software and/or development tools hosted on an infrastructure (e.g., a computing platform and/or a solution stack from which the client can create software interfaces and applications, e.g.,
Microsoft Azure).  SaaS may include, e.g., software hosted by a service provider and accessible over a network (e.g., the software for the application and/or the data associated with that software application may be kept on the network, e.g., Google
Apps, SalesForce).  DaaS may include, e.g., providing desktop, applications, data, and/or services for the user over a network (e.g., providing a multi-application framework, the applications in the framework, the data associated with the applications,
and/or services related to the applications and/or the data over the network, e.g., Citrix).  The foregoing is intended to be exemplary of the types of systems and/or methods referred to in this application as "cloud" or "cloud computing" and should not
be considered complete or exhaustive.
<br/><br/> Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to implement devices and/or processes and/or systems, and thereafter use engineering and/or other practices to integrate such implemented devices and/or processes and/or
systems into more comprehensive devices and/or processes and/or systems.  That is, at least a portion of the devices and/or processes and/or systems described herein can be integrated into other devices and/or processes and/or systems via a reasonable
amount of experimentation.  Those having skill in the art will recognize that examples of such other devices and/or processes and/or systems might include--as appropriate to context and application--all or part of devices and/or processes and/or systems
of (a) an air conveyance (e.g., an airplane, rocket, helicopter, etc.), (b) a ground conveyance (e.g., a car, truck, locomotive, tank, armored personnel carrier, etc.), (c) a building (e.g., a home, warehouse, office, etc.), (d) an appliance (e.g., a
refrigerator, a washing machine, a dryer, etc.), (e) a communications system (e.g., a networked system, a telephone system, a Voice over IP system, etc.), (f) a business entity (e.g., an Internet Service Provider (ISP) entity such as Comcast Cable,
Qwest, Southwestern Bell, etc.), or (g) a wired/wireless services entity (e.g., Sprint, Cingular, Nextel, etc.), etc.
<br/><br/> In certain cases, use of a system or method may occur in a territory even if components are located outside the territory.  For example, in a distributed computing context, use of a distributed computing system may occur in a territory even
though parts of the system may be located outside of the territory (e.g., relay, server, processor, signal-bearing medium, transmitting computer, receiving computer, etc. located outside the territory).  A sale of a system or method may likewise occur in
a territory even if components of the system or method are located and/or used outside the territory.  Further, implementation of at least part of a system for performing a method in one territory does not preclude use of the system in another territory.
<br/><br/> One skilled in the art will recognize that the herein described components (e.g., operations), devices, objects, and the discussion accompanying them are used as examples for the sake of conceptual clarity and that various configuration
modifications are contemplated.  Consequently, as used herein, the specific exemplars set forth and the accompanying discussion are intended to be representative of their more general classes.  In general, use of any specific exemplar is intended to be
representative of its class, and the non-inclusion of specific components (e.g., operations), devices, and objects should not be taken limiting.
<br/><br/> With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or
application.  The various singular/plural permutations are not expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.
<br/><br/> The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components.  It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many
other architectures may be implemented which achieve the same functionality.  In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively "associated" such that the desired functionality is achieved.  Hence, any
two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as "associated with" each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components.  Likewise, any two components so
associated can also be viewed as being "operably connected", or "operably coupled," to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being "operably couplable," to each other
to achieve the desired functionality.  Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and/or physically interacting components, and/or wirelessly interactable, and/or wirelessly interacting components, and/or
logically interacting, and/or logically interactable components.
<br/><br/> In some instances, one or more components may be referred to herein as "configured to," "configured by," "configurable to," "operable/operative to," "adapted/adaptable," "able to," "conformable/conformed to," etc. Those skilled in the art will
recognize that such terms (e.g. "configured to") can generally encompass active-state components and/or inactive-state components and/or standby-state components, unless context requires otherwise.
<br/><br/> This application may make reference to one or more trademarks, e.g., a word, letter, symbol, or device adopted by one manufacturer or merchant and used to identify and distinguish his or her product from those of others.  Trademark names used
herein are set forth in such language that makes clear their identity, that distinguishes them from common descriptive nouns, that have fixed and definite meanings, and, in many if not all cases, are accompanied by other specific identification using
terms not covered by trademark.  In addition, trademark names used herein have meanings that are well-known and defined in the literature, and do not refer to products or compounds protected by trade secrets in order to divine their meaning.  All
trademarks referenced in this application are the property of their respective owners, and the appearance of one or more trademarks in this application does not diminish or otherwise adversely affect the validity of the one or more trademarks.  All
trademarks, registered or unregistered, that appear in this application are assumed to include a proper trademark symbol, e.g., the circle R or [trade], even when such trademark symbol does not explicitly appear next to the trademark.  To the extent a
trademark is used in a descriptive manner to refer to a product or process, that trademark should be interpreted to represent the corresponding product or process as of the date of the filing of this patent application.
<br/><br/> While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing
from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. 
It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as "open" terms (e.g., the term "including" should be interpreted as
"including but not limited to," the term "having" should be interpreted as "having at least," the term "includes" should be interpreted as "includes but is not limited to," etc.).  It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific
number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present.  For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may
contain usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim recitations.  However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or
"an" limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to claims containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or
"an" (e.g., "a" and/or "an" should typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.  In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim
recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers, typically means
at least two recitations, or two or more recitations).  Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, and C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would
understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, and C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.).  In
those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, or C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B,
or C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.).  It will be further understood by those within the art that typically a
disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms unless
context dictates otherwise.  For example, the phrase "A or B" will be typically understood to include the possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B."
<br/><br/> With respect to the appended claims, those skilled in the art will appreciate that recited operations therein may generally be performed in any order.  Also, although various operational flows are presented in a sequence(s), it should be
understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently.  Examples of such alternate orderings may include overlapping, interleaved, interrupted, reordered, incremental,
preparatory, supplemental, simultaneous, reverse, or other variant orderings, unless context dictates otherwise.  Furthermore, terms like "responsive to," "related to," or other past-tense adjectives are generally not intended to exclude such variants,
unless context dictates otherwise.
<br/><br/> While various aspects and embodiments have been disclosed herein, other aspects and embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art.  The various aspects and embodiments disclosed herein are for purposes of illustration and are not
intended to be limiting, with the true scope and spirit being indicated by the following claims.
