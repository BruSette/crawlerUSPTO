       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A method and system for managing a messaging campaign within an
     enterprise are disclosed. Such a method includes generating with a server
     a user interface, the interface being configured to allow a user to
     select a recipient list based upon one or more contextual attributes
     stored in a database, wherein the contextual attributes are based upon
     the interaction of one or more recipients with external systems. The
     method also includes selecting a recipient list using the user interface
     based upon a set of contextual attributes, generating electronic messages
     within a message campaign, and sending the electronic messages to
     recipients on the recipient list.

<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>That which is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method for sending an electronic communication within a message campaign to a plurality of recipients, the method comprising: generating with a server, a user
interface, the user interface being configured, based upon a predetermined context assigned to a first user, to allow the first user to select a recipient list based upon one or more attributes of potential recipients within the predetermined context,
wherein the predetermined context is selected from a plurality of contexts stored in a database, wherein each context stored in the database comprises a set of attributes made available to one or more users, wherein an attribute of the one or more
attributes comprises an online social influence rating, and wherein the first user is restricted from viewing attributes of potential recipients outside the predetermined context;  creating a recipient list using the user interface by selecting among the
one or more attributes, wherein selecting among the one or more attributes comprises randomly sampling from the potential recipients within the predetermined context that have the online social influence rating;  generating electronic messages within a
message campaign;  sending the electronic messages to recipients on the recipient list;  in response to sending the electronic messages to the recipients on the recipient list, generating a new context comprising a new set of attributes, the new set of
attributes comprising the attributes of the predetermined context other than the selected one or more attributes;  and automatically assigning the new context to the first user, wherein the new context restricts the first user from accessing attributes
of potential recipients other than the new set of attributes, wherein the new set of attributes comprises at least one attribute linked to a particular potential recipient, and wherein substantially all attributes of the new set of attributes that are
linked to the particular potential recipient maintain the privacy of the particular potential recipient.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, wherein the electronic messages comprise email.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1, wherein the electronic messages comprise short message service (sms) messages.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving the recipient list.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 4, wherein the one or more attributes comprise an attribute of a social media communication.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 5, wherein the social media communication comprises a post on a website.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 1, further comprising autoconfiguring access to the one or more attributes within the context.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 1, wherein the set of attributes are made available to one or more users based on at least one selected from the group consisting of user permissions, enterprise structure, delivery channel, policy, campaign, and the
preferences of a recipient.
<br/><br/> 9.  The method of claim 1, wherein the predetermined context is assigned to the user based on the user's permissions.
<br/><br/> 10.  The method of claim 1, wherein the predetermined context comprises attributes that are selected based on rules comprising an attribute filter.
<br/><br/> 11.  The method of claim 1, wherein the predetermined context comprises attributes that are selected based on rules comprising an attribute filter;  and wherein the attribute filter is configured to filter based on criteria comprising a
preference of a recipient, an enterprise structure, and a permission of the first user.
<br/><br/> 12.  The method of claim 1, wherein the predetermined context comprises attributes that are selected based on rules comprising an attribute filter;  wherein the attribute filter is configured to filter based on criteria comprising a preference
of a recipient, an enterprise structure, and a permission of the first user;  and wherein an attribute of the one or more attributes is based on an interaction of a recipient with an external system.

<br/><br/> Many corporations, associations, groups, franchisors and other entities, referred to generally as enterprises, send communications to persons who have or might have an interest in receiving communications from such enterprises.  Not all
organizational units of an enterprise have the same need, desire or entitlement to access information regarding any individual person.  For instance, an organizational unit that has developed a customer relationship and obtained permission to send
correspondence (e.g., emails) from a campaign to an individual would have a different level of need, desire or entitlement to access information regarding that individual than another business unit within the enterprise that has had no past dealings and
is unlikely to have future dealings with the individual.  The systems used by enterprises today to manage subscriber information and send communications provide some security protections but fail to provide a user with the ability to take full advantage
of subscriber information.  In fact, the systems used today tend to require a user to utilize a script or other burdensome activity.  According, there exists a need for a system and method for subscriber management that provides security measures and
dynamic information for maximizing the benefit of electronic communication campaigns. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> The features and advantages of this disclosure, and the manner of attaining them, will be more apparent and better understood by reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 shows a system for managing a messaging campaign within an enterprise according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 shows a method for managing a messaging campaign within an enterprise according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 shows a method for managing a messaging campaign within an enterprise according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 shows a method for managing a messaging campaign within an enterprise according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 shows a method for managing a messaging campaign within an enterprise according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure.
<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the present disclosure, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings, and specific language will be used to describe the same.  It will nevertheless
be understood that no limitation of the scope of this disclosure is thereby intended.
<br/><br/> The system and method of the present disclosure provide subscriber management based around attributes within a context, access control of subscriber information of an enterprise, and the ability to send communications to subscribers where the
subscribers are selected based upon attributes within a context.  The system and method of the present disclosure manage attributes through contexts and can send electronic messages to recipients based upon the selection of an attribute or attributes
within the contexts.
<br/><br/> While at times described generally with reference to one-to-one marketing and email campaigns, the system and method of the present disclosure is applicable for use with all forms of electronic messages, including, but not limited to, email,
sms, mms, voice, and social postings.  Also, while the term "subscriber" is used herein, it should be understood that such term, unless otherwise specifically indicated should not be viewed as limiting, but includes all types of recipients or potential
recipients of electronic messages.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 shows one embodiment of a system for managing a messaging campaign within an enterprise 10 according to the present disclosure.  As shown in FIG. 1, the system 10 may include an electronic message provider (e.g., email service provider
(ESP) system) 12, one or more enterprise systems 14, a plurality of recipient devices 16, and a network 18.
<br/><br/> Each enterprise system 14 is typically a computer system or network of computer systems including enterprise level devices 20, second tier devices 22 and third tier devices 24 accessible by differing business units of an enterprise.  The
enterprise system 14 may include one or more networks 30, which may be, for example, a proprietary local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or a public cloud based network.
<br/><br/> Enterprise level devices 20, second tier devices 22, third tier devices 24 and the plurality of recipient devices 16 may be computers, computing devices, or systems of a type well known in the art, such as a mainframe computer, workstation,
personal computer, laptop computer, hand-held computer, cellular telephone, or personal digital assistant.  Enterprise level devices 20, second tier devices 22, third tier devices 24 and the plurality of recipient devices 16 may comprise such software,
hardware, and componentry as would occur to one of skill in the art, such as, for example, one or more microprocessors, memory systems, input/output devices, device controllers, and the like.  Typically, enterprise level devices 20, second tier devices
22, third tier devices 24 and the plurality of recipient devices 16 may also comprise one or more data entry means (not shown) operable by users of the same for data entry.  For example, a pointing device (such as a mouse), keyboard, touchscreen,
microphone, voice recognition, and/or other data entry means may be included.  Enterprise level devices 20, second tier devices 22, third tier devices 24 and the plurality of recipient devices 16 may also comprise a display means which may comprise many
of the well known display means such as, for example, cathode ray tube displays, liquid crystal diode displays, and light emitting diode displays, upon which information may be displayed in a manner perceptible to the user.
<br/><br/> Typically, enterprise level devices 20, second tier devices 22 and third tier devices 24 communicate with each other via network 30.  Enterprise level devices 20, second tier devices 22, third tier devices 24 and the plurality of recipient
devices 16 may communicate with server 40 via computer network 18.  In FIG. 1, computer network 30 and computer network 18 are shown as distinct computer networks.  It should be noted, however, that computer networks 18 and 30 may comprise the same
computer network.  The communication between enterprise level devices 20, second tier devices 22, third tier devices 24 and the plurality of recipient devices 16 and server 40 may be bi-directional.  Computer networks 18 and 30, or both, may comprise the
Internet.  It should be noted that various networks, such as Ethernet networks, cable-based networks, and satellite communications networks, well known in the art, and/or any combination of networks are contemplated to be within the scope of the
disclosed system.
<br/><br/> Server 40 may comprise one or more server computers, computing devices, or systems of a type known in the art.  Typically, server 40 further comprises such software, hardware, and componentry as would occur to one of skill in the art, such as,
for example, microprocessors, memory systems, input/output devices, device controllers, display systems, and the like.  Server 40 may comprise one of many well known servers, such as, for example, IBM.RTM.'s AS/400.RTM.  Server, IBM.RTM.'s AIX UNIX.RTM. 
Server, or a Windows Server.  In FIG. 1, server 40 is shown and referred to herein as a single server.  However, server 40 may comprise a plurality of servers or other computing devices or systems interconnected by hardware and software systems known in
the art which collectively are operable to perform the functions allocated to server 40.  As shown in FIG. 1, the server 40 may be communicatively coupled to the network 18 and configured to generate a user interface for presentation to devices of
enterprise systems 14 such that a user may access and utilize the database (described below) and generally interact with other devices of the system to generate and send electronic communications.
<br/><br/> The messaging engine 44 is configured to send messages (e.g., emails) for campaigns on behalf of enterprises to recipients.  The messaging engine 44 and server 40 are configured to access memory 42 to store information regarding recipients of
emails, email campaigns, enterprises and other relevant information in memory.  In FIG. 1, a database (not shown) is implemented in memory 42 and associated with server 40.  As shown in FIG. 1, the memory 42 is coupled to the server 40 so the database is
also accessible to server 40.  The database may also be associated with server 40 where the database resides on a server or computing device remote from server 40, where the remote server or computing device is capable of continuous bi-directional data
transfer with server 40.  The database retrievably stores information (e.g., attributes) that is communicated to the database from enterprise level devices 20, second tier devices 22, third tier devices 24 and the plurality of recipient devices 16
through computer network 18.  Information related to all of the subscribers of the enterprise marketing campaigns may be stored in memory accessible to the enterprise level system, such as in the database of memory 42.
<br/><br/> While the database referred to herein is a single database, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the database may comprise a plurality of databases connected by software systems of a type well known in the art, which
collectively are operable to perform the functions delegated to database according to the present disclosure.  The database may comprise a relational database architecture or other database including columnar data stores, in memory data stores, and
distributed data processing environment, such as, for example, Apache.TM.  Hadoop.TM..  The database may comprise one of many database management systems, such as, for example, MICROSOFT.RTM.'s SQL.RTM.  Server, MICROSOFT.RTM.'s ACCESS.RTM., or
IBM.RTM.'s DB2.RTM.  database management systems, or the database management systems available from ORACLE.RTM.  or SYBASE.RTM..
<br/><br/> The more data that an enterprise collects about its subscribers, the more targeted and personalized the enterprise can make its communications with the subscribers.  To help consolidate what an enterprise knows about its subscribers, various
attributes can be created.  For example, profile attributes can be created to manage demographic information, and preference attributes can be created to capture such information as the frequency with which the subscriber wants to receive information
from the enterprise.  Profile attributes offer great flexibility in allowing a variety of data to be captured and in controlling the type of data that is captured related to a subscriber.  Once an enterprise has defined its attributes related to its
subscribers, the enterprise can use the attributes to create groups and drive personalized and dynamic content.
<br/><br/> According to the present disclosure, attributes generally represent information that is known about a person.  Attributes can be relatively static like names, customer number, and hair color.  Attributes can also be fleeting such as transaction
ID, item shopped for, or name of the person challenging you to an online duel.  Attributes may be populated from various data sources and may include various external sources (e.g., Klout score).  Attributes may be embodied in various types, including
XML and HTML.
<br/><br/> Attributes can be defined at the enterprise level in the database.  These attributes will apply to all persons contained within the enterprise other than ad hoc lists tied to specific data sources (e.g., an import from a file to support a
one-time send).  Business units can also define attributes that enhance those of the enterprise.  Enterprises typically desire the flexibility to allow people imported into a business unit to be imported into the enterprise at the same time.  The method
and system of the present disclosure has devised a means of combining enterprise and business unit attributes within the context of a business unit so that they seem like a single set of attributes belonging to the business unit.
<br/><br/> Attributes may have a simple set of required metadata, such as, for example, type, data length, default, and support for NULL values.  Attributes may require a rich set of metadata to support advanced analysis and usability.  The ability to
categorize attributes is helpful in accounts that have a large attribute count.  For example, data may be presented as a manageable list of user defined categories such as demographic, business, and personal.  Users can then expand each of these
categories to view the actual attributes (or perhaps more attribute categories).
<br/><br/> According to the system and method of the present disclosure, the model implemented for managing attributes in the database is based around contexts.  In the present disclosure, a context refers to a set of attributes that are made available to
particular user(s).  With contexts, users may effectively utilize the system to reach, send information to, or otherwise communicate with individuals using a variety of communication means without sacrificing the privacy of the individuals.  For example,
suppose user A is a salesperson of a car repair shop and user B is the owner of the car repair shop.  The system may be arranged and contexts set such that when user A accesses the system, user A encounters a user interface that shows the following
attributes: makes and models of cars, work that has been done on those cars, email addresses for those cars, and warranties for those cars.  With this information, user A can send out electronic messages to the car owners regarding the upcoming
termination of warranty information or need to replace a car part.  User B may have a different context when it comes to the stored attributes.  That is, when user B accesses the system, user B may encounter a user interface that shows all of the
attributes that user A can see but also the payments made by each of the customers.  With this information, user B may be able to send out electronic messages, including coupons, to the car owners that have spent the most money or least amount of money
at the car repair shop.  In other words, attributes of people may only be known under certain contexts.  It should also be noted that attributes may have different values in different contexts.
<br/><br/> The model for managing attributes in the database provides for an autoconfiguration.  That is, attribute sets can be assigned to various users and sets of users.  As discussed previously, this provides users with a simple and time efficient
mechanism for accessing and utilizing the applicable attributes to generate and send electronic messages.
<br/><br/> In the database, people (e.g., subscribers) represent the human beings that entities (e.g., companies) are trying to message or otherwise communicate.  Addresses are the key to interacting with the people over some communication medium. 
Addresses include things such as, but not limited to, email addresses, cell phone numbers, Facebook.RTM.  names, or phone numbers.  A person can have no addresses or many addresses associated with him or her.  For example, they might have an email
address and a cell phone number to which SMS messages may be sent.  A user can also have multiple addresses of the same kind.  For example, Joe might have a work email address that would be tagged with "work" and a home email address tagged with "home". 
A user could target a send to Joe to either the home or work address.  It should also be noted that addresses may be associated with no people or many people.  As further discussed below, an address that is not associated with a person or people may
eventually be associated with a person or people based upon activity of the address and the like.
<br/><br/> In the database of the present disclosure, each person generally has a unique Person Key.  A Person Key can be assigned by the user or assigned by the system.  People who enter the system via Web Capture, MO, or Social Forwarding may generally
require a system generated key.  Over time, captured people may be identified as existing persons within the system.  The system can allow users to assign a new key to the captured person and consolidate their history with the existing person (while
providing some level of visibility to the earlier state).
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the attributes in the database may be defined for people to describe where people reside, such as for geo-targeting.  This could be done using user-defined attributes, but may be accomplished
when the attributes are provided by the system.  Some of the location specific attributes may be Zip Code, Country, City, State, Area Code, Latitude/Longitude and Locale.  Typically, in order to support notifications and internal communication, each
Business Unit should have a list that represents the users of that business unit.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the database may be configured for dimensional attributes.  Dimensional attributes involve the use of a key which is stored within the person record.  This key references a metadata store
that defines the attributes unique to that key.  Dimensional attributes allow the system to roll up data about people at different levels of a hierarchy.  For example, a known attribute may be a zip code.  From the zip code, a user may be able to pull
out information regarding city, state, and country.  Dimensional attributes also allow drill down from higher levels into lower levels of the hierarchy.  "Drill paths" can be used to define drill up and drill down relationships between otherwise
disconnected dimensional attributes and to cut across the hierarchy of a dimension.
<br/><br/> The system collects attributes into attribute sets such that each attribute belongs to one and only one attribute set.  An attribute set will commonly group together attributes that are obtained from a single source.  For example, an attribute
set might contain all of the attributes available about Facebook.TM.  users.  Each attribute set is stored in a data structure.  This structure could be a table in a database, a set of rows connected by a common key in a key-name-value store, or as a
semi-structured binary representation (such as xml or json).  Furthermore, these attribute sets can be distributed across multiple data stores for purposes of redundancy, availability, and performance.  Relationships describe the links between people and
attribute sets.  An example of such a relationship is "is a <b><i>facebook</i></b> user".  It relates a person within the system to the attributes about that person sourced from <b><i>Facebook</i></b>.
<br/><br/> The database of the present disclosure may include a relationships capability.  Relationships may be used to tie attribute sets to addresses.  For example, a user might associate an anonymous page view of a web site with the IP address of the
viewer.  An attribute set could be created that stores the attributes tied to an IP address such as user agent, IP Address, cookie data, location, and the viewer's locale.  Attribute sets that are linked to addresses may also be linked to all the persons
tied to the addresses.
<br/><br/> In order to select a group of recipients for a messaging campaign, a user will typically need to generate a list based upon the attributes in the database.
<br/><br/> Lists that are used to describe the targets for a message are called audiences.  Audiences are lists of people and or addresses.  Metadata tied to the audience defines the attributes sets available to messages intended for the audience.  The
audience's associations between people, addresses, and attributes sets are used to define the context of the send.  The attribute sets tied to an audience are determined based upon user preference, user permissions, and recipient preferences.  The
attribute sets tied to an audience represent the attributes that can be used to "safely" generate a message for a person.  It should be noted that "safely" in this context typically means unlikely to give the recipient cause for feeling that his or her
privacy has been invaded.
<br/><br/> Each list provides a context for the people on the list.  Certain information about a person on a list is available due to the person belonging to the list.  In other words, for each list, there is a set of subscriber attributes that we know
about each person on the list.  These attributes are the List's Person Attributes.  It should be noted that some lists may include an attribute regarding whether a potential recipient has opted-in to a campaign or otherwise would like to receive
messages.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the database may be configured for attribute equivalence.  Attribute equivalence allows a user to specify that an attribute found in one context is equivalent to an attribute found in another
context.  For example, suppose Steve A and Stephen A are actually the same person but have separate profiles.  Attribute equivalence may allow users to define an attribute (e.g., work address) of Steve A and Stephen A as being the same.
<br/><br/> A person can have multiple attribute sets.  User permissions, enterprise structure, delivery channel, policy, campaign, and the preferences of the recipient may determine which attribute sets that a user within the enterprise can access.  The
attribute sets available to the user who generates the message provides the context for the electronic message.  Attributes that belong to attribute sets other than the ones within the context are not accessible for purposes of message generation. 
However, the context used for message generation can be different than the context for audience generation.  For example, the system that generates overdraft notices for a bank will have access to attribute sets that contain very sensitive data such as
Account Number and Account Balance.  A user of the bank in the marketing department may want to send a promotional email for overdraft protection to people who have been overdrawn within the last year.  The marketing user will require access to an
attribute set that provides an indicator of the client having been overdrawn in order to develop the audience for this email.  The marketing user will not require access to the attribute sets with sensitive data for targeting.  Once the audience has been
established, the marketing user no longer needs access to the attribute set with the overdraft indicator.  So this attribute set will not be included in the context used for general sending of other messages.  In this way, the attribute information can
benefit the Business Units while still maintaining privacy for the individual.
<br/><br/> A person may be tied to multiple attribute sets.  In general, a person will always be accessible by the system within a specific context that defines what is known about that person within that context.  There may be several levels of context. 
For example, there may be a public data context that contains all of the attribute sets that can be derived from publicly available data sources and a universal context that defines what information about a person is available to users within the system. The universal context can include public data attribute sets based upon configuration and user preference.  An enterprise context may define the attributes of the people that are available throughout the enterprise.  A business unit context may define
the attributes of people that are available to users of that business unit.  A campaign context may define the attributes of people included within the campaign.  It should be noted that each of these contexts can have sub-contexts based upon intent. 
For example, the enterprise context can have sub-contexts of analytic enterprise context and a message generation enterprise context.
<br/><br/> A few attributes may be tied to a particular context.  For example, the universal context may include, for example, the subscriber key, created date, status, source, and linkedto.  "Subscriber key" may be a unique identifier assigned to, for
example, the person by a company or the system.  "Created date" may be when the person entered the system.  "Status" can be "Active", "Inactive", and "Linked".  The "Active" and "Inactive" statuses can be used to indicate whether users can interact with
the person or not.  "Source" may define the manner in which the user was added to the system.  In addition to this simple Source field, the system may also maintain a record of all the ways that a user is brought into the system.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a person with a status of "linked" may be consolidated with another person in the system.  For example, suppose that Joe is a person in the system who receives emails and we have Joe's email address
as well as his person key.  There is another person in the system known as "Mystery Man" who interacted with the system via a mobile originated message.  At some point, it is discovered that Mystery Man is in fact Joe.  Both may be linked together by
setting Mystery Man's status to "Linked" and LinkedTo to point at Joe.  Typically, user defined attributes cannot be added to the universe.
<br/><br/> Filtered audiences are lists that are created from other lists based upon a set of rules.  A segment is a list that is created from one or more source list(s) based upon a formula.  This could be a simple subset (all persons on the source list
who have red hair).  It could be a subset based upon related tables (all persons on the source list who have red hair and have clicked within the last two weeks).  Segments can also be created from the union (all persons on list A with red hair and all
persons on list B and wear glasses) or intersection (all persons on list A with red hair who also are on list B and wear glasses) of the source lists.  Segments can also be created by randomizing functions.  Segmentation rules can include a mixture of
attribute filters and randomizing.  For example, a segment could be created containing a random sample of 100 people who have red hear and wear glasses.  Segments have no attributes of their own, but all the attributes defined in the source lists is
visible within the segment.  If an attribute is added to a segment source list after the segment was generated, the new attribute is visible within the segment.  Segments typically do not support imports.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the disclosed system and method, a user interface generated by the server 40 allows enterprises to manage information regarding subscribers, including the generation of lists.  Enterprises can create as many or as few lists
as necessary by interacting with the user interface.  Enterprises can add subscribers to a list manually (individually) or by importing a collection of subscribers to a given list.  When enterprises wish to have an ESP send emails on their behalf as part
of an email marketing campaign, the enterprise can choose the recipients by selecting the appropriate lists and/or groups.
<br/><br/> The system of the present disclosure allows the enterprise to filter the "All Subscribers" list available to the enterprise level users so that only subscribers that meet the defined filter criteria are displayed to business unit level users. 
Administrators interacting via an administrator device with the User Interface generated by the server may be provided with an action presented on a business unit listing page to allow the user to define the subscriber filter for a Business Unit.  In
other words, the user can set the filter criteria for the specified Business Unit.  It should be noted that the user may define context via permissions or rules to allow different users to view and interact with only some or all of the information or
attributes associated with each person.
<br/><br/> As noted previously, enterprises often utilize an Email service provider (ESP), a company providing Email services, to carry out their Email marketing campaigns.  ESPs often offer many services that permit an enterprise to conduct effective
Email marketing campaigns.  Some ESPs such as, for example, ExactTarget, LLC, provide toolsets to enterprises that include: content creation tools; personalization, segmentation, and viral marketing tools; underlying technology and deliverability tools;
tools facilitating data transfer between the ESP's system and database and other business systems of the enterprise; tracking and graphical reporting tools and management tools allowing account administrator control, customization, and configuration.
<br/><br/> To facilitate implementing an Email campaign, the enterprise will typically provide the ESP with an address or subscriber list of persons or entities that should be presented with Emails contained in the Email campaigns.  This subscriber list
may be in the form of a database including names, Email addresses and other demographic or business related information regarding each potential recipient.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 shows a method of managing a campaign and sending electronic messages 200.  As shown in FIG. 2, the method 200 includes the step 210 of generating with a server a user interface, where the interface is configured to allow a user to select
a recipient list based upon one or more attributes within a particular context stored in a database.  The contextual attributes are based upon the interaction of one or more recipients with external systems.  In FIG. 2, the method 200 also includes the
step 220 of selecting a recipient list using the user interface based upon a set of contextual attributes and the step 230 of generating electronic messages within a message campaign.  The method 200 also includes the step 240 of sending the electronic
messages to recipients on the recipient list.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 shows a method of arranging attributes within various contexts and sending electronic messages to recipients selected based on the attributes 300.  As shown in FIG. 3, the method 300 includes the step 310 of receiving attribute
information.  The method 310 includes the step 320 of storing at least a portion of the attribute information based upon the interaction of a corresponding subscriber with external systems.  The method 300 further includes the step 330 of filtering the
stored attribute information within a context and the step 340 of identifying recipients based upon the filtering of the attributes.  The method 300 also includes the step 350 of generating electronic messages and the step 360 of sending the electronic
messages to the identified recipients.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 shows a method of managing a messaging campaign 400.  As shown in FIG. 4, the method 400 includes the step 410 of receiving a recipient list based upon the filtering of a database with attributes within a context that describe the
corresponding recipient's interaction with external systems.  The method 400 also includes the step 420 of generating electronic messages and the step 430 of sending the electronic messages to the subscribers identified on the list.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 shows a method of managing a messaging campaign 500.  As shown in FIG. 5, the method includes the step 510 of autoconfiguring access to attributes of a database to determine a plurality of contexts.  It should be noted that
autoconfiguring access to attributes of a database generally refers to automatically selecting the attributes and corresponding information that particular users can access.  This configuration may be based upon a variety of factors, including privacy
concerns.  Of course, the access to attributes of a database may also be done by a user.  The method 500 also includes the step 520 of accessing attributes of a database within one of the plurality of contexts and the step 530 of creating a list of
recipients by selecting attributes within the one of the plurality of contexts.  The method 500 further includes the step 540 of generating electronic messages and the step 550 of sending the electronic messages to the subscribers identified on the list.
<br/><br/> The disclosed system and method facilitates management of subscriber information and access to such information in a more efficient manner across the enterprise including all of the business units of the enterprise.  In one example of managing
subscribers across an enterprise comprising multiple business units, a database 42 including all subscribers to one or more campaigns of the enterprise is maintained at, or only fully accessible to, the enterprise only at the enterprise, top or corporate

different sequence of steps may be employed to accomplish the same results.  Each such implementation falls within the scope of the present disclosure as disclosed herein and in the appended claims.  Furthermore, this application is intended to cover
