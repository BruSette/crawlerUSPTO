       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> The present invention is related to a social system and process used for
     bringing virtual social network into real life, which is allowed for
     gathering and analyzing a social message of at least one interlocutor
     from virtual social network so as to generate at least one recommended
     topic, allowing a user to talk with the interlocutor through the
     utilization of the recommended topic, and then capturing and analyzing at
     least one speech and behavior and/or physiological response of the
     interlocutor during talking so as to generate an emotion state of the
     interlocutor. The user is allowed to determine whether the interlocutor
     is interested in the recommended topic through the emotion state of
     interlocutor. Thus, it is possible to bring the social message on virtual
     network into real life, so as to increase communication topics between
     persons in real life.

at least one recommended conversation topic adaptive to the scene recognition result, the selective generation of said at least one recommended conversation topic being based on said suitability determined therefor;  and an emotion analysis processor
portion, analyzing said speech, facial expression, and body movement of the at least one interlocutor so as to determine an emotion state of the at least one interlocutor, wherein said at least one recommended conversation topic and said emotion state
are provided to the user, and said social message processor portion generates a different conversation topic upon determination of inconsistency of said at least one recommended conversation topic with said emotion state of said interlocutor.
<br/><br/> 2.  The social system according to claim 1, wherein information corresponding to said at least one recommended conversation topic and said emotion state of the at least one interlocutor are displayed on an image window.
<br/><br/> 3.  The social system according to claim 2, further comprising a camera, said camera capturing the real scene in which the user talks with the at least one interlocutor, a video content of said real scene being displayed on said image window.
<br/><br/> 4.  The social system according to claim 3, wherein said augmented reality processor portion further includes an unsalient region recognition processor portion, said unsalient region recognition processor portion recognizing at least one
unsalient region from said real scene, said unsalient region remaining visually offset from views of either the interlocutor or complex image contours, said augmented reality processor portion adaptively positioning the information corresponding to said
at least one recommended conversation topic and said emotion state in said at least one unsalient region.
<br/><br/> 5.  The social system according to claim 4, wherein the information corresponding to said at least one recommended conversation topic and said emotion state are drawn in said at least one unsalient region via an object type.
<br/><br/> 6.  The social system according to claim 5, wherein said augmented reality processor portion further comprises: a photorealistic rendering processor portion performing a photorealistic rendering of the information corresponding to said at least
one recommended conversation topic and said emotion state of the object type drawn in said at least one unsalient region;  and a stable rendering processor portion rendering the information corresponding to said at least one recommended conversation

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a system structure chart for a social system bringing virtual social network into real life according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention.  As illustrated in this figure, the social system 100
comprises a social message processing module 11, a video/audio capture module 12, and an emotion analysis module 13.  Wired or wireless network connection may be used for the social system 100 selectively.
<br/><br/> When a user of the system 100 is ready to talk with at least one interlocutor, a social message 110 of interlocutor (such as identity, preferred multimedia information, recommended information, browsed information, shared information and so on
of interlocutor) may be pre-gathered by the social message processing module 11 firstly on social network (such as <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, YouTube, MySpace and so on).  Subsequently, the gathered social message 110 of interlocutor may be analyzed by the
social message processing module 11, so as to generate at least one recommended topic 111, such as traveling, reading, tennis, living topics, for example.
<br/><br/> The recommended topic 111 may be used by the user to talk with the interlocutor.  Speech and behavior 120 of interlocutor, such as tone, facial expression, body movement and/or content of talk, for example, may be detected by the video/audio
capture module 12 during talking.  The speech and behavior 120 of interlocutor is analyzed by the emotion analysis module 13 so as to generate an emotion state 130 of interlocutor.  The emotion state 130 is used to express the emotional response of
interlocutor during talking.
<br/><br/> For instance, one of topics 111 (such as traveling topic) recommended by the system 100 may be utilized by the user to talk with the interlocutor.  If the speech and behavior 120 of high-pitched tone, joyous expression revealed on face, rich
body movement, and/or talking about interesting travel experience is expressed by the interlocutor during talking, the emotion state 130 of a positive response (such as delight), implying the interest of interlocutor in traveling topic, may be generated
by the system 100 correspondingly according to this speech and behavior 120.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, another topic 111 (such as living topic) recommended by the system 100 may be utilized by the user to talk with the interlocutor.  If lifeless tone, expressionless face, drifting eye contact and/or few words are expressed by the
interlocutor, the emotion state 130 of a negative response (such as boredom), implying unwillingness to discuss the traveling topic with the interlocutor, may be generated by the system 100 correspondingly according to this speech and behavior 120.
<br/><br/> As such, whether the interlocutor is interested in the recommended topic 111 or not may be determined by the user through the emotion state 130 of either positive or negative response, and whether talking with the interlocutor about the current
recommended topic 111 continuously or talking with the interlocutor about another recommended topic 111 alternatively may be further determined.
<br/><br/> In practical situation, of course, it is also possible for the interlocutor neither being willing to talk with anyone due to bad mood, nor being willing to talk with the user about any topic basically, in such a way that the emotion state 130 of
interlocutor detected by the social system 100 always shows the negative response.  In this case, the user may be also allowed to further consider stopping any talk with the interlocutor.
<br/><br/> In this embodiment, the social system 100 of the present invention may be allowed to bring social message on virtual network into real life, and provide the user with at least one recommended topic 111 in which the interlocutor may be
interested, allowing the user to talk with the interlocutor about the recommended topic 111, in such a way that the communication topics between persons in real life may be increased, further achieving the object of improving interpersonal relationship.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the social system 100 of the present invention, as shown in FIG. 2, the social system 100 may be also installed in an electronic glasses 200 having an image window 21, the image window 21 being the lens element of the
electronic glasses 200.  The recommended topic 111 and the emotion state 130 of interlocutor generated by the system 100 may be displayed on the image window 21 via characters or pictures.  In practical application, the user may talk with the
interlocutor face-to-face directly when wearing the electronic glasses 200, and may be then notified the recommended topic 111 and the emotion state 130 of interlocutor provided by the system 100 immediately through viewing the image window 21 of the
electronic glasses 200 while talking.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the present invention, referring to FIG. 1 again, the identity of interlocutor may be also known to the user in advance, and then set the identity of interlocutor in the social message processing module 11 manually. 
Afterwards, the social message 110 of interlocutor may be then searched and gathered on social network by the social message processing module 11 based on the identity of interlocutor set by the user manually.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, in another embodiment of the present invention, the video/audio capture module 12 comprises a face recognition unit 121.  On talking face-to-face between the user and interlocutor, the face recognition unit 121 may be allowed to
detect the face feature of interlocutor automatically, and then compare the detected face feature of interlocutor with the personal picture to which each identity account on social network corresponds, so as to ascertain the identity of interlocutor. 
Afterwards, the social message 110 of interlocutor may be then searched and gathered on social network by the social message processing module 11 based on the identity of interlocutor recognized by the face recognition unit 121.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the face recognition unit 121 may be also allowed to recognize face feature of interlocutor of several interlocutors so as to ascertain the identity of several interlocutors simultaneously, further achieving the capability of social
talk with a plurality of interlocutors simultaneously for the user.
<br/><br/> The social system 100 further comprises a camera module 15 and an augmented reality (AR) processing module 16.  The camera module 15 is used to shoot a real scene 150 in which the interlocutor talks with the user, and the video content of the
real scene 150 may be displayed on the image window 21.  Moreover, the recommended topic 111 and the emotion state 130 may be drawn in the real scene 150 through the utilization of augmented reality processing module 16, as shown in FIG. 3.
<br/><br/> The augmented reality processing module 16 comprises an unsalient region recognition unit 161, a photorealistic rendering unit 163 and a stable rendering unit 165.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 3, the unsalient region recognition unit 161 is capable of recognizing at least one unsalient region 1501 from the real scene 150, the unsalient region 1501 being an region of which a viewer (such as the user of the system
mentioned in the present invention) is less aware when viewing the real scene 150.  In this embodiment, for instance, the real scene 150 is a scene shot in a classroom, and the unsalient region 1501 is then a blackboard, a trashcan, a desk or a window. 
The augmented reality processing module 16 may be allowed to draw the recommended topic 111 and the emotion state 130 of interlocutor in the unsalient region 1501 via the means of a virtual object type, in such a way that hiding the salient region (such
as the area where the interlocutor is located or the area where the contours of image is complex) in the real scene 150 by the recommended topic 111 and the emotion state 130 of interlocutor, resulting in visual confusion generated for the user viewing
the real scene 150, may be avoided.
<br/><br/> When the recommended topic 111 and the emotion state 130 of the object type are drawn in the unsalient region 1501 of the real scene 150, the photorealistic rendering unit 163 is used to perform a photorealistic rendering procedure on the
recommended topic 111 and the emotion state 130 of the object type with reference to the background light of the real scene 150 correspondingly, in such a way that the recommended topic 111 and the emotion state 130 of the object type may be blended into
the real scene 150 naturally, so as to achieve the highly realistic effect.
<br/><br/> Moreover, the stable rendering unit 165 is used to draw the recommended topic 111 and the emotion state 130 of the object type in an appropriate place of the unsalient region 1501 steady.  Thus, as shown in FIG. 4, when the unsalient region 1501
within the real scene 150 is moved since the shooting angle changes, the recommended topic 111 and the emotion state 130 of the virtual object type may be adjusted in placement by the stable rendering unit 165 correspondingly, so as to avoid the
positioning of the recommended topic 111 and the emotion state 130 of the virtual object type drawn to the salient region due to varied shooting angles.  The unsalient region 1501, of course, may be also possibly disappeared or decreased in the real
scene 150 due to the variation of shooting angle, such that the recommended topic 111 and the emotion state 130 of the virtual object type may be not drawn.  Therefore, a new unsalient region 1501 may be recognized from the current shot real scene 150
again by the unsalient region recognition unit 161.
<br/><br/> The recommended topic 111 and the emotion state 130 of the virtual object type may be joined seamlessly with and then integrated naturally with the real scene 150 through the image processing procedure performed by the unsalient region
recognition unit 161, the photorealistic rendering unit 163 and the stable rendering unit 165.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment of the present invention, additionally, the augmented reality processing module 16 further comprises a scene recognition unit 167.  The scene recognition unit 167 is used to recognize and analyze the content of scene,
location of scene and/or shooting time of the real scene 150, so as to generate a scene recognition result 1671.  In addition to the gathered social message 110 of interlocutor, the social message processing module 11 of the present embodiment further
analyzes the scene recognition result 1671 so as to generate the recommended topic 111 in which the interlocutor may be interested and which is suitable for the occasion.
<br/><br/> For instance, if the content of scene of the real scene 150 is recognized as, by the scene recognition unit 167, populousness, a hospital of location of scene and a daytime of shooting time, it is found, in the analysis provided by the social
message processing module 11 according to this scene recognition result 1671, that this occasion is not suitable for talking about excessively joyous and private matter, so as to avoid the generation of inopportune recommended topic 111.
<br/><br/> Continuously, the social system 100 of the present invention may be installed not only in the electronic glasses 200, but also in a mobile phone, a computer, or an electronic device capable of displaying data message, selectively.  Moreover, the
social system 100 may be applied in face-to-face talking between the user and interlocutor, but also selectively applied in the case of video talk between the user and interlocutor.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 5, there is shown a system structure chart for a social system bringing virtual social network into real life according to another embodiment of the present invention.  The social system 300 of the present embodiment is similar
to the social system 100 of the above embodiment in system structure, with the difference therebetween being as follows.  The speech and behavior 120 of interlocutor is captured by the social system 100 in the above embodiment through the usage of the
video/audio capture module 12, so as to analyze whether the interlocutor is interested in the recommended topic 111; while a physiological response 310 of interlocutor is captured by the social system 300 of the present embodiment alternatively through
the usage of a physiology capture module 31, so as to analyze whether the interlocutor is interested in the recommended topic 111.
<br/><br/> Same as above, when a user of the system 300 is ready to talk with at least one interlocutor, a social message 110 of interlocutor may be pre-gathered by the social message processing module 11 firstly on social network.  Subsequently, the
gathered social message 110 of interlocutor may be analyzed by the social message processing module 11, so as to generate at least one recommended topic 111.
<br/><br/> The recommended topic 111 may be used by the user to talk with the interlocutor.  The physiological response 310 (body temperature, breath, blood pressure, heartbeat, brain waves, pupil) generated on the body of interlocutor may be detected by
the physiology capture module 31 during talking.  Afterwards, the physiological response 310 of interlocutor is analyzed by the emotion analysis module 13 so as to generate an emotion state 130 of interlocutor correspondingly.
<br/><br/> In this embodiment, whether the interlocutor is interested in the recommended topic 111 may be also found in the analysis provided by the social system 300 of the present embodiment when the physiological response 310 generated on the body of
interlocutor is detected by the physiology capture module 31.
<br/><br/> In addition, the physiology capture module 31 mentioned in the present embodiment may also comprise a body temperature sensor, a blood pressure monitor, a breath monitor, a brain waves inspector, a pupil detector and/or an equipment capable of
detecting the physiological response of body.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, elements, except for the physiology capture module 31 of the social system 300 of the present embodiment, are essentially the same as those of the social system 100 of the above embodiment in the way to embody and in the application
thereof, and thus should not be explained repeatedly herein.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 6, there is shown a flow chart of a social process bringing virtual social network into real life according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the social process being applied in an electronic device (such as
an electronic glasses, a mobile phone, a computer, for example).  In step S51, firstly, as shown in this figure, networking is performed by a user through the electronic device, and the social message 110 of at least one interlocutor is gathered form
virtual social network.  The gathered social message 110 of interlocutor is analyzed to generate at least one recommended topic 111 correspondingly.
<br/><br/> In step S52, one of the recommended topics 111 is selected and the selected recommended topic 111 is then used by the user to talk with the interlocutor.  In step S53, the speech and behavior 120 of interlocutor and/or the physiological response
310 on the body of interlocutor may be captured during talking.  In step S54, subsequently, the speech and behavior 120 and/or the physiological response 310 of interlocutor may be analyzed so as to generate the emotion state 130 of interlocutor.
<br/><br/> Afterwards, whether the interlocutor is interested in the recommended topic 111 may be determined by the user through the emotion state 130 of interlocutor, and then talking with the interlocutor about whether the current recommended topic 111
continuously or another recommended topic 111 alternatively may be further decided.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 7, there is shown a flow chart of a social process bringing virtual social network into real life according to another embodiment of the present invention, the social process being applied in an electronic device.  In step S61
firstly, as shown in this figure, a user is allowed to shoot the real scene 150 in which the user talks with an interlocutor by means of the camera module 15 of the electronic device.
<br/><br/> In step S62, the content of scene, location of scene and/or shooting time of the real scene 150 may be recognized, so as to generate a scene recognition result 1671.
<br/><br/> In step S63, further networking is performed by the user through the electronic device, and the social message 110 of at least one interlocutor is gathered from virtual social network.  The gathered social message 110 of interlocutor and the
scene recognition result 1671 are analyzed to generate at least one recommended topic 111.
<br/><br/> In step S64, one of the recommended topics 111 is selected and the selected recommended topic 111 is then used by the user to talk with the interlocutor.  In step S65, the speech and behavior 120 of interlocutor and/or the physiological response
310 on the body of interlocutor may be captured during talking.  In step S66, subsequently, the speech and behavior 120 and/or the physiological response 310 of interlocutor may be analyzed so as to generate the emotion state 130 of interlocutor.
<br/><br/> Afterwards, whether the interlocutor is interested in the recommended topic 111 may be determined by the user through the emotion state 130 of interlocutor, and then talking with the interlocutor about whether the current recommended topic 111
continuously or another recommended topic 111 alternatively may be further decided.
<br/><br/> To sum up, the social system and process of the present invention may be allowed for bringing social message on virtual network into real life, and provided for increasing communication topics between persons in real life, whereby a better
social effect is achieved, further improving interpersonal relationship.
<br/><br/> The foregoing description is merely one embodiment of the present invention and not considered as restrictive.  All equivalent variations and modifications in shape, structure, feature, and spirit in accordance with the appended claims may be
