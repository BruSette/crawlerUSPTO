     with a transactional server, a plurality of listeners being configured to
     monitor interactions during a play of the game for communication to the
     transactional server, and means for displaying notifications from the
     transactional server. The transactional server is at least configured for
     processing received interactions in conjunction with a progressive
     jackpot contest associated with the game and communicating notifications
     regarding the processing to the contest framework. A communicating with
     the transactional server at least comprises associating the game with a
     progressive jackpot contest and setting parameters for the progressive

<br/><br/>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> One or more embodiments of the invention generally relate to a mobile-gaming platform.  More particularly, the invention relates to an application interface (API) and software-development kit (SDK) that allows third-party developers to generate
gaming revenue for their online and mobile games.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The following background information may present examples of specific aspects of the prior art (e.g., without limitation, approaches, facts, or common wisdom) that, while expected to be helpful to further educate the reader, are not to be
construed as limiting the present invention, or any embodiments thereof, to anything stated or implied therein or inferred thereupon.
<br/><br/> In the $24 billion mobile-gaming industry, a majority of in-application (in-app) revenue is generated from purchases of virtual currencies and goods; mobile players spend tens of billions of dollars each year for the challenge to accumulate the
most virtual items, which hold zero value outside of the games that they play, and to add their names at the top of the leader boards.  At best, this tendency is a testament to "game stickiness", which arises from any factor that encourages a player to
stay longer and to return.  However, to remain relevant in the gaming industry, third-party developers must not only promote the mirage of value associated with virtual incentives, they must also continuously update their games as well as try to retain
users while monetizing their games at the same time.  In view of the foregoing, it is clear that this approach is not perfect and leaves room for more optimal approaches.
<br/><br/> The following is an example of a specific aspect in the prior art that, while expected to be helpful to further educate the reader as to additional aspects of the prior art, is not to be construed as limiting the present invention, or any
embodiments thereof, to anything stated or implied therein or inferred thereupon.  One such aspect of the prior art is believed to show a methods and systems for interfacing with a third-party application.  Although it appears that the systems and
methods disclosed are directed primarily to gaming machines and systems, some of the apparatuses, systems and methods disclosed might be adaptable for use in other types of devices, systems or environments, as applicable, such that their use is not
restricted exclusively to gaming machines and contexts.  At least one display device may be a mobile display device, such as a PDA or tablet PC that enables play of at least a portion of the primary or secondary game at a location remote from the gaming
machine.  For example, it is believed that the remote host or another host may provide a progressive game with a progressive jackpot to a group of gaming machines and that the gaming machine to which the remote host is sending content may be operable to
play the progressive game but may not be currently participating in the progressive game at a particular time and thus not contributing to the jackpot, which in this example is one indicator of the group state of the gaming machine in the group.  It is
believed that when the progressive jackpot reaches a certain level or a game participant/player completes a certain task or a user creates qualifying notification settings, the remote host may send information to the gaming machine to indicate that the
jackpot has reached a certain threshold to entice a player on the gaming machine to join the progressive game.  Thus, it appears that the remote host may dynamically adjust content sent to the gaming machine based upon a group state for a group of gaming
machines that the gaming machine is currently not affecting.  Additionally, in other embodiments, it is believed that the request sent by third-party device may include a request to obtain a SDK from server-based system.  It appears that in these
embodiments, the SDK is used by third-party user to develop the content approval application or the graphical element creation application.  Moreover, it is believed that in other embodiments, the SDK is used by third-party user to develop content that
is displayed on gaming display device where the SDK includes the graphical element creation application.
<br/><br/> By way of educational background, another aspect of the prior art generally useful to be aware of is that of what appears to be a gaming reality system and a mobile device that features the application of providing the player with many
opportunities to win awards, such as cash or prizes to maintain a player's interest in a gaming machine.  The application also appears to teach of using progressive jackpots for more experienced players, which may cause strategy to vary depending upon
the current progressive amount.  The application appears to make calls to the augmented reality technology SDK to determine if a tag is present in the current live camera image, and if so, the SDK returns the position of the tag relative to the user in
3D space.  Additionally, the SDK appears compatible with Unity plugin, an Android or Apple smartphone/tablet with a rear-facing camera and ARM processor, and a video gaming machine with LCD or other flat screen displays.
<br/><br/> As a point of educational reference, such approaches may not provide a progressive jackpot rewards system where gamers are allow to make as many attempts as they wish (no cap) at attaining the high score of a contest given that they have
sufficient funds in their account and the contest time has not expired.  Additionally, such approaches may not provide a dynamic rewards structure that may be manipulated by, for example, a web-based dashboard to perform varies functions such as create
contests, implement different payout structures, adjust contest parameters, and send content, messages, and notifications to players.  Furthermore, such approaches may not provide a social element that allows players to share contests and statuses, such
as jackpot amounts, with others.
<br/><br/> In view of the foregoing, it is clear that these traditional techniques are not perfect and leave room for more optimal approaches. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

provided separately or in any suitable subcombination.  The Applicants hereby give notice that new Claims may be formulated to such features and/or combinations of such features during the prosecution of the present Application or of any further
Application derived therefrom.
<br/><br/> References to "one embodiment," "an embodiment," "example embodiment," "various embodiments," etc., may indicate that the embodiment(s) of the invention so described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but not every
embodiment necessarily includes the particular feature, structure, or characteristic.  Further, repeated use of the phrase "in one embodiment," or "in an exemplary embodiment," do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment, although they may.
<br/><br/> Headings provided herein are for convenience and are not to be taken as limiting the disclosure in any way.
<br/><br/> The enumerated listing of items does not imply that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive, unless expressly specified otherwise.
<br/><br/> The terms "a", "an" and "the" mean "one or more", unless expressly specified otherwise.
<br/><br/> Devices or system modules that are in at least general communication with each other need not be in continuous communication with each other, unless expressly specified otherwise.  In addition, devices or system modules that are in at least
general communication with each other may communicate directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.
<br/><br/> A description of an embodiment with several components in communication with each other does not imply that all such components are required.  On the contrary a variety of optional components are described to illustrate the wide variety of
possible embodiments of the present invention.
<br/><br/> As is well known to those skilled in the art many careful considerations and compromises typically must be made when designing for the optimal manufacture of a commercial implementation any system, and in particular, the embodiments of the
present invention.  A commercial implementation in accordance with the spirit and teachings of the present invention may configured according to the needs of the particular application, whereby any aspect(s), feature(s), function(s), result(s),
component(s), approach(es), or step(s) of the teachings related to any described embodiment of the present invention may be suitably omitted, included, adapted, mixed and matched, or improved and/or optimized by those skilled in the art, using their
average skills and known techniques, to achieve the desired implementation that addresses the needs of the particular application.
<br/><br/> A "computer" may refer to one or more apparatus and/or one or more systems that are capable of accepting a structured input, processing the structured input according to prescribed rules, and producing results of the processing as output. 
Examples of a computer may include: a computer; a stationary and/or portable computer; a computer having a single processor, multiple processors, or multi-core processors, which may operate in parallel and/or not in parallel; a general purpose computer;

<br/><br/> Those of skill in the art will appreciate that where appropriate, some embodiments of the disclosure may be practiced in network computing environments with many types of computer system configurations, including personal computers, hand-held
devices, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like.  Where appropriate, embodiments may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where
tasks are performed by local and remote processing devices that are linked (either by hardwired links, wireless links, or by a combination thereof) through a communications network.  In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located
in both local and remote memory storage devices.
<br/><br/> "Software" may refer to prescribed rules to operate a computer.  Examples of software may include: code segments in one or more computer-readable languages; graphical and or/textual instructions; applets; pre-compiled code; interpreted code;
compiled code; and computer programs.
<br/><br/> The example embodiments described herein can be implemented in an operating environment comprising computer-executable instructions (e.g., software) installed on a computer, in hardware, or in a combination of software and hardware.  The
computer-executable instructions can be written in a computer programming language or can be embodied in firmware logic.  If written in a programming language conforming to a recognized standard, such instructions can be executed on a variety of hardware
platforms and for interfaces to a variety of operating systems.  Although not limited thereto, computer software program code for carrying out operations for aspects of the present invention can be written in any combination of one or more suitable
programming languages, including an object oriented programming languages and/or conventional procedural programming languages, and/or programming languages such as, for example, Hyper text Markup Language (HTML), Dynamic HTML, Extensible Markup Language
(XML), Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL), Document Style Semantics and Specification Language (DSSSL), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL), Wireless Markup Language (WML), Java.TM., Jini.TM., C, C++,
Smalltalk, Perl, UNIX Shell, Visual Basic or Visual Basic Script, Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML), ColdFusion.TM.  or other compilers, assemblers, interpreters or other computer languages or platforms.
<br/><br/> Computer program code for carrying out operations for aspects of the present invention may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the
like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the "C" programming language or similar programming languages.  The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software
package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server.  In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area
network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).
<br/><br/> A network is a collection of links and nodes (e.g., multiple computers and/or other devices connected together) arranged so that information may be passed from one part of the network to another over multiple links and through various nodes. 
Examples of networks include the Internet, the public switched telephone network, the global Telex network, computer networks (e.g., an intranet, an extranet, a local-area network, or a wide-area network), wired networks, and wireless networks.
<br/><br/> The Internet is a worldwide network of computers and computer networks arranged to allow the easy and robust exchange of information between computer users.  Hundreds of millions of people around the world have access to computers connected to
the Internet via Internet Service Providers (ISPs).  Content providers (e.g., website owners or operators) place multimedia information (e.g., text, graphics, audio, video, animation, and other forms of data) at specific locations on the Internet
referred to as webpages.  Websites comprise a collection of connected, or otherwise related, webpages.  The combination of all the websites and their corresponding webpages on the Internet is generally known as the World Wide Web (WWW) or simply the Web.
<br/><br/> Aspects of the present invention are described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention.  It will be understood
that each block of the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions.  These computer program instructions may be
provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data
processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.
<br/><br/> The flowchart and block diagrams in the figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments.  In this regard, each block
in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s).  It should also be noted that, in some alternative
implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures.  For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse
order, depending upon the functionality involved.  It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special
purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.
<br/><br/> These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable medium that can direct a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored
in the computer readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instructions which implement the function/act specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.
<br/><br/> Further, although process steps, method steps, algorithms or the like may be described in a sequential order, such processes, methods and algorithms may be configured to work in alternate orders.  In other words, any sequence or order of steps
that may be described does not necessarily indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order.  The steps of processes described herein may be performed in any order practical.  Further, some steps may be performed simultaneously.
<br/><br/> It will be readily apparent that the various methods and algorithms described herein may be implemented by, e.g., appropriately programmed general purpose computers and computing devices.  Typically a processor (e.g., a microprocessor) will
receive instructions from a memory or like device, and execute those instructions, thereby performing a process defined by those instructions.  Further, programs that implement such methods and algorithms may be stored and transmitted using a variety of
known media.
<br/><br/> When a single device or article is described herein, it will be readily apparent that more than one device/article (whether or not they cooperate) may be used in place of a single device/article.  Similarly, where more than one device or article
is described herein (whether or not they cooperate), it will be readily apparent that a single device/article may be used in place of the more than one device or article.
<br/><br/> The functionality and/or the features of a device may be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices which are not explicitly described as having such functionality/features.  Thus, other embodiments of the present invention need not
include the device itself.
<br/><br/> The term "computer-readable medium" as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing data (e.g., instructions) which may be read by a computer, a processor or a like device.  Such a medium may take many forms, including but not
limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media.  Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory.  Volatile media include dynamic random access memory (DRAM), which typically
constitutes the main memory.  Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise a system bus coupled to the processor.  Transmission media may include or convey acoustic waves, light waves and
electromagnetic emissions, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications.  Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other
magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or
any other medium from which a computer can read.
<br/><br/> Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying sequences of instructions to a processor.  For example, sequences of instruction (i) may be delivered from RAM to a processor, (ii) may be carried over a wireless transmission
medium, and/or (iii) may be formatted according to numerous formats, standards or protocols, such as Bluetooth, TDMA, CDMA, 3G.
<br/><br/> Where databases are described, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that (i) alternative database structures to those described may be readily employed, (ii) other memory structures besides databases may be readily employed. Any schematic illustrations and accompanying descriptions of any sample databases presented herein are exemplary arrangements for stored representations of information.  Any number of other arrangements may be employed besides those suggested by the
tables shown.  Similarly, any illustrated entries of the databases represent exemplary information only; those skilled in the art will understand that the number and content of the entries can be different from those illustrated herein.  Further, despite
any depiction of the databases as tables, an object-based model could be used to store and manipulate the data types of the present invention and likewise, object methods or behaviors can be used to implement the processes of the present invention.
<br/><br/> A "computer system" may refer to a system having one or more computers, where each computer may include a computer-readable medium embodying software to operate the computer or one or more of its components.  Examples of a computer system may
include: a distributed computer system for processing information via computer systems linked by a network; two or more computer systems connected together via a network for transmitting and/or receiving information between the computer systems; a
computer system including two or more processors within a single computer; and one or more apparatuses and/or one or more systems that may accept data, may process data in accordance with one or more stored software programs, may generate results, and
typically may include input, output, storage, arithmetic, logic, and control units.
<br/><br/> A "network" may refer to a number of computers and associated devices that may be connected by communication facilities.  A network may involve permanent connections such as cables or temporary connections such as those made through telephone or
other communication links.  A network may further include hard-wired connections (e.g., coaxial cable, twisted pair, optical fiber, waveguides, etc.) and/or wireless connections (e.g., radio frequency waveforms, free-space optical waveforms, acoustic
waveforms, etc.).  Examples of a network may include: an internet, such as the Internet; an intranet; a local area network (LAN); a wide area network (WAN); and a combination of networks, such as an internet and an intranet.
<br/><br/> As used herein, the "client-side" application should be broadly construed to refer to an application, a page associated with that application, or some other resource or function invoked by a client-side request to the application.  A "browser"
as used herein is not intended to refer to any specific browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, FireFox, or the like), but should be broadly construed to refer to any client-side rendering engine that can access and display Internet-accessible
resources.  A "rich" client typically refers to a non-HTTP based client-side application, such as an SSH or CFIS client.  Further, while typically the client-server interactions occur using HTTP, this is not a limitation either.  The client server
interaction may be formatted to conform to the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and travel over HTTP (over the public Internet), FTP, or any other reliable transport mechanism (such as IBM.RTM.  MQSeries.RTM.  technologies and CORBA, for transport
over an enterprise intranet) may be used.  Any application or functionality described herein may be implemented as native code, by providing hooks into another application, by facilitating use of the mechanism as a plug-in, by linking to the mechanism,
and the like.
<br/><br/> Exemplary networks may operate with any of a number of protocols, such as Internet protocol (IP), asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), and/or synchronous optical network (SONET), user datagram protocol (UDP), IEEE 802.x, etc.
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the present invention may include apparatuses for performing the operations disclosed herein.  An apparatus may be specially constructed for the desired purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose device selectively activated
or reconfigured by a program stored in the device.
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the invention may also be implemented in one or a combination of hardware, firmware, and software.  They may be implemented as instructions stored on a machine-readable medium, which may be read and executed by a computing
platform to perform the operations described herein.
<br/><br/> More specifically, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product.  Accordingly, aspects of the present invention may take the form of an
entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a "circuit," "module" or
"system." Furthermore, aspects of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable medium(s) having computer readable program code embodied thereon.
<br/><br/> In the following description and claims, the terms "computer program medium" and "computer readable medium" may be used to generally refer to media such as, but not limited to, removable storage drives, a hard disk installed in hard disk drive,
and the like.  These computer program products may provide software to a computer system.  Embodiments of the invention may be directed to such computer program products.
<br/><br/> An algorithm is here, and generally, considered to be a self-consistent sequence of acts or operations leading to a desired result.  These include physical manipulations of physical quantities.  Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities
take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated.  It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values,
elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers or the like.  It should be understood, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities.
<br/><br/> Unless specifically stated otherwise, and as may be apparent from the following description and claims, it should be appreciated that throughout the specification descriptions utilizing terms such as "processing," "computing," "calculating,"
"determining," or the like, refer to the action and/or processes of a computer or computing system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulate and/or transform data represented as physical, such as electronic, quantities within the computing
system's registers and/or memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computing system's memories, registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.
<br/><br/> In a similar manner, the term "processor" may refer to any device or portion of a device that processes electronic data from registers and/or memory to transform that electronic data into other electronic data that may be stored in registers
and/or memory.  A "computing platform" may comprise one or more processors.
<br/><br/> Embodiments within the scope of the present disclosure may also include tangible and/or non-transitory computer-readable storage media for carrying or having computer-executable instructions or data structures stored thereon.  Such
non-transitory computer-readable storage media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer, including the functional design of any special purpose processor as discussed above.  By way of example, and
not limitation, such non-transitory computer-readable media can include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to carry or store desired
program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions, data structures, or processor chip design.  When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or combination
thereof) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a computer-readable medium.  Thus, any such connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium.  Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of the
computer-readable media.
<br/><br/> While a non-transitory computer readable medium includes, but is not limited to, a hard drive, compact disc, flash memory, volatile memory, random access memory, magnetic memory, optical memory, semiconductor based memory, phase change memory,
optical memory, periodically refreshed memory, and the like; the non-transitory computer readable medium, however, does not include a pure transitory signal per se; i.e., where the medium itself is transitory.
<br/><br/> Some embodiments of the present invention may provide means and/or methods for storage, analysis, and/or management of data.  In some of these embodiments, data may be provided by users and/or received from external software.  Many embodiments,
and variations thereof, may provide for a framework for contests.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a software-development kit (SDK) and application interface (API) that can be integrated into third-party games, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, the SDK 104 is accessed
through a transactional server 110.  In some embodiments, the SDK 104 may also be accessed via a cloud network, a storage device, such as, but not limited to, a cd, disc or flash drive, or any kind of computer/CPU, processor or server that is capable of
hosting the SDK 104.  The SDK 104 may integrate with the third-party gaming platform with mobile, PC, or console programming, computer code, or script 106.  In a non-limiting example, the integrated SDK 104 allows uninterrupted game play.  In the present
embodiment, the third-party programming, computer code, or script 106 may be accessed by player(s) 102, contest attempts 108, the SDK 104 and the gaming server 112.  In an alternate embodiment, transactional server 110 may directly access or host the
third-party programming 106 or connect with the gaming server 112 to retrieve needed data.  In a non-limiting example, player(s) 102 interact through the third party gaming interface 106 but are connected to the SDK 104 behind the scenes.  In the present
embodiment, the SDK 104 may have a series of tools called listeners that may communicate with the third-party programming, computer code, or script 106 and report results and data involving any contest attempts 108 made by player(s) 102 to the
transactional server 110.  In another embodiment, the third-party gaming server 112 may report results to the SDK 104 or the transactional server 110 when a contest attempt 108 is made.  In many embodiments, the transactional server 110 may take the
results from any contest attempt 108 and use the data to perform functions such as, but not limited to, rank the contest attempt 108 results in relevant or associated contest(s) and apply the result to the player's 102 profile and gaming history.  In the
present embodiment, the SDK 104 and the third-party gaming framework 106 communicate in the backend to ensure that gaming quality and user experience remains fluid.  In the present embodiment, the SDK 104 may have `listeners` embedded throughout the
software to monitor and report user interaction data, metrics, and trip actions that notify the SDK 104/server 110 to perform a certain action.  A listener may be generally known as a collection of nested interfaces with callbacks that captures the
player(s) 102 interaction within the third-party gaming framework 106.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates a system architecture, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, server 110 provides the infrastructure upon which the software runs.  In a non-limiting example, server 110 may be a
dedicated infrastructure.  In another non-limiting example, server 110 may be a cloud-based or shared infrastructure that is leased from a provider of cloud-based services.  The web application 205 provides the software that runs on the server and
contains the application and business logic of the innovation.  The web application 205 may take data received from contest attempts 108 and may apply it to the correlating contest.  The web application 205 is the engine that runs the platform,
performing many different functions such as, but not limited to, holding, tracking and scoring contests, determining winner(s), and all other logic needed to operate such as, but not limited to, managing accounts of player(s) 102, deposits, contest
attempt 108 histories, and more.  The SDK 104 may be provided to a third-party developer 210 to be integrated into its apps, and once the SDK 104 is integrated, the administrator 215 may be given full control of the software via a web dashboard 220.  The
third-party developer 210 may have access to tools 225 that enhance the function of the software.  Tools 225 may include, but are not limited to, integration instructions, debugging tools, plugins, sample integrations and other helpful resources that
help simplify the integration process or supplement SDK 104 performance.  In a non-limiting example, the third-party developer 210 may use an IP address to verify the location, primarily, without limitation, to ensure that the player(s) 102 are playing
within a jurisdiction that allows the usage of this software.  A database 230 provides storage for all persistent states of the software.  Finally, the players 102 as "users" may be able to utilize the SDK 104 in the apps and games in which the
third-party developer 210 has integrated the SDK 104.  In a non-limiting example, players may still play the third-party game, even if the SDK is not integrated.  In this example they may not be able to compete in progressive jackpot contests provided by
the SDK.  In another non-limiting example, if the SDK is integrated, players may still play the game without playing in a contest.  In this example their game attempts and results simply are not reported or factored in to the contest(s) and only go
towards that game's own internal leaderboard, if any.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an exemplary method 300 for integrating the SDK, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, the third-party developer 210 signs up by creating a profile in a step 305, and,
using the web dashboard, generates an app name in a step 310, and creates a new app and receives a unique API key for the game/app 106 in a step 315.  In an alternate embodiment, third-party developer 210 may be assigned a unique API key that they may
embed in each of their games along with the SDK and use for authentication while talking with the SDK within the game.  After the API key is displayed in a step 320, the third-party developer 210 may elect, in a step 325 to integrate the API key with the
SDK 104 via, without limitation, a Gradle, an Ant, or a Maven build system.  For a Gradle build system, the third-party 210 may use the Gradle repository link (build.gradle) to add dependency in the settings and build, in a step 330; for a Maven build
system, the third-party developer 210 may add the Maven repository and dependency in the pom.xml settings, in a step 335; and, for an Ant build system, the third-party developer 210 may download Assets, Res, and Jar files from the web dashboard 220
server 110 and integrate the files into the code or game 106, in a step 440.  In other embodiments, the API key may be integrated with the SDK 104 by other means such as, but not limited to, other alternate programming languages.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates a player using deposited funds to pay an attempt fee architecture, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, a player 102 may make a contest attempt 108 at any time during a contest
405 as long as he has sufficient funds to pay the attempt fee 410 and the contest time 415 has not expired.  An unlimited number of players 420 may make unlimited contest attempts 425 during unexpired contest time 415.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates the fee-splitting architecture, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, for each contest attempt 108 by a player 102, the attempt fee 410 may be held in escrow 505 until the
result of the attempt 108 has been reported to the server 110.  When the result of the attempt 108 is reported to the server 110, the funds may be released from escrow into the appropriate accounts, according to the parameters set in the web dashboard
220.  The attempt fee 410 is split between a fixed percentage 510 going toward the progressive jackpot 515 and a fixed percentage 510 going toward the administrator account 520 to be split between the administrator 215 and the third-party developer 210
of the game 405.  In a non-limiting example, the fee-splitting percentages are, in the web dashboard 220, defined by either the administrator 215 or the third-party developer 210.  In the present embodiment, the administrator 215, without limitation, may
implement a minimum and a maximum percentage of each attempt fee 410 that either the administrator 215 or the third-party developer 210 may receive or a minimum and a maximum percentage of each attempt fee 410 that goes to the progressive jackpot 515 of
the contest 405.  The administrator 215 may have access and overriding control over aspects in the web dashboard 220, including, but not limited to, contests 405, parameters of contests 405, and level of access granted to the third-party developer 210. 
The attempt fee 410 may be refunded if a contest 405 is not available when the results of a contest attempt 108 are reported.  The administrator 215 may also manually administer a refund if the administrator 215 deems it appropriate.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a flowchart of an exemplary method 600 for reporting scores, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, when a contest attempt 108 is completed, the SDK 104 reports results in a step 605. 
The SDK then determines whether the contest 405 is still available in a step 610.  If the SDK 104 determines that the contest 405 is not available, then the SDK 104 determines whether a new contest 108 is available in a step 620.  If the SDK 104
determines that a new contest 108 is not available, then the SDK 104 refunds the attempt fee to the account of player 102 in a step 630.  If the SDK 104 determines that the contest 405 is still available in a step 610, then the SDK 104 ranks the
performance of player 102 in a step 640, releases the attempt fee 410 in a step 645, displays the score of player 102 in a step 650, and displays the "Play again?" prompt in a step 655.  If, however, the SDK 104 determines that the contest 405 is not
available and that a new contest is available in a step 620, the SDK reports and applies relevant metrics from the attempt 108 made to the new contest in a step 635, ranks the performance of the player 102 in a step 640, releases the attempt fee 410 in a
step 645, displays the score of player 102 in a step 650, and displays the "Play again?" prompt in a step 655.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 illustrates a contest lobby, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, a player 102 may access the contest lobby 700 through a web dashboard 220 or app/website.  In some embodiments, the
app/website may provide the user with a list of apps/games that have integrated the SDK 104 along with a list of current contests.  The contest lobby 700 displays a list of current games 705 that have integrated with the SDK 104.  In a non-limiting
example, the game 705 may include Angry Birds, Tank Battles, Words with Friends, and X racing.  In the present embodiment, the lobby 700 also displays, without limitation, for each game 705, the contest time 415 as "time remaining", the contest type 710,
the attempt fee 410, the progressive jackpot 515 as "current jackpot", the current leader and score 720, and the current score 640 of player 102.  In a non-limiting example, the remaining contest time 415 may be displayed in days, hours, and/or minutes. 
In another non-limiting example, the contest type 710 may include, without limitation, highest score, most kills, fastest time, longest time duration, highest level, ect. In another non-limiting example, the jackpot 515 is displayed in american currency. In other embodiments, the jackpot may be displayed in another currency or virtual currency.  In the present embodiment, a player 102 may join any contest 405 via the "play" button 730.  In other embodiments, player 102 player may also join, without

contest standings and jackpot information.  The player 102, at a step 1015, selects the notification display 900.  When the player 102 selects the notification display 900, the SDK 104 connects with the web server 110 parameters, in a step 1020.  In a
non-limiting example, the web server 110 parameters may be the current user level, age, location, account authentication, account status and whether the player 102 is eligible for that particular contest.  The web application 220 responds with the
current ongoing contest, in a step 1025 and accordingly, the SDK 104 displays to the player 102 contest details 1030.  In some embodiments, if the player does not have sufficient funds to participate, a deposit prompt may appear.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 illustrates an in-game notification registration prompt, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, a general notification display 900 may prompt the player 102 of a new contest.  In some
embodiments, other means of electronic communications including, but not limited to, email (link provided), text (link provided), social media (link provided), QR code (link provided), etc. may notify the player.  The player 102, through the "play"
button 730 must register or login via the in-game notification registration prompt 1100 if they chose to play or click on the "no" button 1190 to exit.  In some embodiments, the player may exit to normal game third-party gameplay as if they simply
continued with the game as if the prompt never appeared.  In some embodiments, notification may pop up again in the future should they keep playing the third-party game.  The registration prompt 1100 accommodates both new user registration 1105 and
existing registered users 1110.  The prompt 1100 has, without limitation, fields for existing players 102 to type their username 1115 and password 1120, and a "login" button 1125 to enter the game lobby 700.  The prompt 1100 for a new player has, without
limitation, fields for new player to type full name 1135, email 1140, birthdate 1145, password 1150, username 1155 and a continue button 1160.  The registration prompt 1100 may also contain legal terms of use 1165.  In a non-limiting example, the legal
terms may be consenting that player 102 over age of 18 1170, agreeing to the terms and conditions 1175, a link embedded to the terms and conditions 1180, and an embedded help link 1185.  In some embodiments, user registration 1105 may include, without
limitation, the player's phone number and address.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 is a flowchart of an exemplary method 1200 for player registration, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, a player 102 may sign up through the administration dashboard 120, in a step 1205
by electing to use in a step 1210 a Twitter/Google Plus account in a step 1215, or, a <b><i>Facebook</i></b> account in a step 1220 or, by manually entering an email and password in a step 1225.  In other embodiments, other social media accounts may be linked.  The
registration system, in a step 1230, may verify if that email is available and, if yes, in a step 1235, continue to prompt player 102 to deposit funds.  If the email is not available, the player 102 may be prompted for email again in a step 1240 and the
system may again verify the email availability in a step 1230.  In a non-limiting example, the system may automatically ping the given email address to ensure it exist or email availability may be checked through database 230 on transactional server 110. If the player 102 elects to deposit funds, in a step 1235, the deposit prompt notification 1300 may assist the player 102 in making deposit, in a step 1250.  Once the deposit is successful, or if the player 102 elects not to deposit funds, at a step
1255, the registration process concludes.  In some embodiments, the player may be prompted to deposit when he/she tries to enter a contest or make an attempt but doesn't have sufficient funds.  The user may also go into his/her account details via web
dashboard and/or app/website and deposit.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 illustrates an in-game notification deposit prompt, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, following the registration prompt 1100 continue button 1160, the player 102 is taken to the

the deposit prompt may have a link to start over for new users 1375 and to register 1380.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 is a flowchart of an exemplary method 1400 for the player deposit, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  A player 102, may input the amount of funds to be deposited through the deposit prompt 1300 in the amount to
be deposited field 1345 in a step 1405.  The player 102 may elect in a step 1410 to deposit funds using, without limitation, a credit card, PayPal, or virtual currencies.  For a credit card deposit, in a step 1415, the player 102 enters credit card
information.  For a PayPal deposit, in a step 1420, the player 102 enters PayPal information.  For a virtual currency deposit, in a step 1425, the player 102 enters their email address and password.  In a non-limiting example, third parties such as, but
not limited to, Stripe and PayPal may process payments into an admin bank account.  The players may be credited the amount to their account.  Should a player wish to withdraw a remaining amount or withdraw winnings, admin may pay out from the admin bank
account.  Additionally, third-party developers may be paid their % from the admin bank account as well.  In a non-limiting example, a virtual currency may be Bitcoin.  Once the player 102 enters their payment details, the system prompts the player 102 to
save the player's payment information for future uses in a step 1430.  If the player elects to have the payment information saved, in a step 1435, the SDK 104 may store the payment information.  In a non-limiting example, payment information may be
stored on transactional server 110 and database 230.  Once the payment information is successfully stored, or if the player 102 elects not to store payment information, at a step 1440, the payment will be securely processed and authorized and credit the
funds to the player's 102 account.
<br/><br/> FIG. 15 illustrates a post-attempt notification display, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, the post-attempt notification display 1500 displays contest information to the player 102.  The
displayed information, without limitation, may include message across the top 1505, a "try again" button 1510, the attempt fee 410 to try again 1515, a "no" button 1190, view other contests 930, the player's 102 score 650, the leader's score and name

leaders 1610 displayed in order by each leader's respective score 1615 and may include the leaders username 1620.
<br/><br/> FIG. 17 is a flowchart of an exemplary method 1700 for the third-party developer account creation, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, a third-party developer 210 may create an account with an
administrator 215 via web dashboard 220 in a step 1705.  In a non-limiting example, the third-party developer 210 may create the account without the assistance of the administrator 215.  The third-party developer 210 may elect to use, in a step 1710,
Twitter/Google Plus in a step 1715, or, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> in a step 1720, or by manually entering an email and password in a step 1725 to connect to the web dashboard 220.  In a non-limiting example, their Email<b><i>/Facebook</i></b>/Twitter/Google+ is associated with their
developer account in the web dashboard which is used to connect their games with embedded SDK to their developer account in the web dashboard.  The registration system, in a step 1730, may verify the email address and, if yes, in a step 1735, conclude
the account creation.  After the email account is verified and the developer account is created, the third-party developer 210 may add games developed by the third-party developer 210 to its developer account via the web dashboard 220.  For each game
added, the web dashboard 220 may generate a unique API key for the developer to embed in the game/code/script 106 along with the SDK 104 in order to sync it with the third-party developer's account in the web dashboard 220.  If the email is not available
or verifiable, in a step 1740, the third-party developer 210 may be prompted for email again and if available, in a step 1735 conclude the account creation.
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 is a flowchart of an exemplary method 1800 for the third-party developer creating a contest, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, the third party developer 210 logs into the API or
dashboard 220 account in a step 1805.  The third-party developer 210 creates and starts a contest by selecting the game/app 106 in a step 1810, and, in a step 1815, establishes the parameters for the contest.  In a non-limiting example, the third-party
developer 210 may establish parameters such as attempt fee amount 410, metric to guide or rank participants, results, contest type, payout structure, notifications, notification settings, and the start and end time.  In another non-limiting example, the
game types 710 may be most kills, most points, and fastest times.  In another non-limiting example, the payout structure may be set as one winner takes all, top 5 payout, top 10 payout, or a percent of the jackpot 515 paid to any capped placing order. 
As a non-limiting example, a percent payout might be, 50% to 1st place, 30% to 2nd place, and 20% to 3rd place.  After the third-party developer 210 has input the parameters, they are saved through the server 110 and onto the database 230, in a step
1820.
<br/><br/> FIG. 19 is a flowchart of an exemplary method 1900 for the platform synchronization, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment the SDK 104 may retrieve the data connection when a game/attempt 108 is
started, in a step 1905.  As a non-limiting example, the third-party developer may need to code in the game script 106 on the game server 112 to push data to the listeners (receptors) of the integrated SDK 104.  The listeners in the embedded SDK 104 may
be triggered and relay any relevant data to the transactional server 110.  The mobile, PC, or console programming, computer code, or script 106 may push every milestone via SDK 104 that has been integrated.  In a non-limiting example, milestones may
include attempt started, finished attempt, current and final score, or results.  In the present embodiment, the SDK 104 immediately scans for any updated information available in the game 106 and/or attempt 108 to push, in a step 1910.  If the SDK 104
recognizes updated information, it attempts to push the updated milestones to the transactional server 110 in a step 1915.  In alternate embodiments, the SDK 104 may push the data to the web dashboard 220 which may relay data to the transactional server
110, or the SDK 104 may push the data to the transactional server 110 which may then relay data to the web dashboard 220.  If the push, in a step 1920 was successful, then the SDK 104 may check to verify if the contest 415 has ended by the time the push
occurred, in a step 1975.  If the contest 415 has not ended, then the platform synchronization may conclude.  However, if the contest 415 has ended, the SDK 104 may verify if a new contest is available, in a step 1980.  If a new contest is available, the
results may be applied to the current or new contest in a step 1985 and the SDK 104 may verify if the contest has ended when pushed again, in a step 1975.  If, in a step 1980, there is not a new contest and, in a step 1990, the attempt fee 410 was held
in escrow, the attempt fee 410 may be refunded to the account of player 102 in a step 1995.  If there is no updated information the platform synchronization may conclude in a step 1999.  However, if the push, in a step 1920 was unsuccessful, the SDK 104
may retry, in a step 1925, using an exponential back off based algorithm, in a step 1930, pushing the milestone, in a step 1915.  If the exponential back off based algorithm is successful, in a step 1925, then, in a step 1999, the platform
synchronization may conclude.  If the push still fails after the exponential back off based retries, then the data may be attempted to be stored into a secure database on the player's 102 device to retry later, in a step 1940.  The data may be attempted
to be saved onto the internal storage of the player's 102 device such as, without limitation, a phone, until the player 102 connects to the internet in a step 1945.  If the data is not saved onto the player's 102 device, in a step 1950, the data may
attempt to be saved on the external storage of the player's 102 device for a future retry, in a step 1955.  If the external data save is successful in a step 1960, then when the player 102 connects to the internet, all the data waiting to be pushed and
the platform synchronization concludes.  If the external data save was unsuccessful, the SDK 104 may use an exponential back off based algorithm in a step 1965 to push the data and retry, in a step 1970.  If the retry is unsuccessful, then the data may
be stored on external storage to retry again later, in a step 1955.  If the retry was successful, then the platform synchronization concludes.
<br/><br/> FIG. 20 is a flowchart of an exemplary method 2000 for the player participation contest, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In the present embodiment, once a player 102 receives a notification about the contest via,
without limitation, a push notification, an in-game notification, email, SMS, advertisement, web dashboard 220, or social media link, the player 102 may click on the participate button.  The player 102 may enter the required registration information or
returning player username and password to authenticate the account information from the player 102, in a step 2005.  The player 102 elects to make a contest attempt 108 in a step 2010 and if the contest 410 is still open, in a step 2015, then, the SDK
104 may verify if there sufficient funds available in the player's 102 account, in a step 2020.  If the contest 410 is not open, then the SDK 104 may check for new contest availability, in a step, 2025.  If a new contest is available, the SDK 104 may
verify if there sufficient funds available in the player's 102 account, in a step 2020.  If there is not a new contest available, the player participation concludes.  If, there are sufficient funds in player's 102 account, then the player 102 may verify
his or her intent to proceed with the attempt fee 410 deduction, in a step 2030.  If then player 102 declines the attempt fee 410 deduction, the player participation concludes.  If the player agrees to the deduction, the attempt fee 410 may be deducted
from the player's 102 account, in a step 2035 and split 510 according to the defined parameters in web dashboard 220, in a step 2040.  The attempt fee 410 is held in escrow 505 until the results from the attempt 108 are recorded in a step 2045 and the
player 102 may proceed to the game 106 to make an attempt 108, in a step 2050.  If there are not sufficient funds in a player's account, the player 102 may be sent to the deposit prompt 1300 to obtain payment authentication from the player 102, in a step
2055.  The player may be taken through the payment process 1400, at a step 2060, and funds may be deposited into the player's 102 account, at a step 2065.  The player 102 may be prompted to make a contest attempt 108, in a step 2070.  If a contest is
available, in a step 2015, then the SDK 104 may verify if there are sufficient funds available in the player's 102 account, in a step 2020 and the player 102 may verify the intent to proceed with the attempt fee 410 deduction, in a step 2030.

<br/><br/> Finally, CPU 2126 optionally may be coupled to network interface 2146 which enables communication with an external device such as a database or a computer or telecommunications or internet network using an external connection shown generally as
communication channel 2116, which may be implemented as a hardwired or wireless communications link using suitable conventional technologies.  With such a connection, CPU 2126 might receive information from the network, or might output information to a
network in the course of performing the method steps described in the teachings of the present invention.
<br/><br/> FIG. 22 is a block diagram depicting a conventional client/server communication system.  A communication system 2200 includes a multiplicity of networked regions with a sampling of regions denoted as a network region 2202 and a network region
2204, a global network 2206 and a multiplicity of servers with a sampling of servers denoted as a server device 2208 and a server device 2210.
<br/><br/> Network region 2202 and network region 2204 may operate to represent a network contained within a geographical area or region.  Non-limiting examples of representations for the geographical areas for the networked regions may include postal zip
codes, telephone area codes, states, counties, cities and countries.  Elements within network region 2202 and 2204 may operate to communicate with external elements within other networked regions or within elements contained within the same network
region.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, global network 2206 may operate as the Internet.  It will be understood by those skilled in the art that communication system 2200 may take many different forms.  Non-limiting examples of forms for communication system
2200 include local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), wired telephone networks, cellular telephone networks or any other network supporting data communication between respective entities via hardwired or wireless communication networks. 
Global network 2206 may operate to transfer information between the various networked elements.
<br/><br/> Server device 2208 and server device 2210 may operate to execute software instructions, store information, support database operations and communicate with other networked elements.  Non-limiting examples of software and scripting languages
which may be executed on server device 2208 and server device 2210 include C, C++, C# and Java.
<br/><br/> Network region 2202 may operate to communicate bi-directionally with global network 2206 via a communication channel 2212.  Network region 2204 may operate to communicate bi-directionally with global network 2206 via a communication channel
2214.  Server device 2208 may operate to communicate bi-directionally with global network 2206 via a communication channel 2216.  Server device 2210 may operate to communicate bi-directionally with global network 2206 via a communication channel 2218. 
Network region 2202 and 2204, global network 2206 and server devices 2208 and 2210 may operate to communicate with each other and with every other networked device located within communication system 2200.
<br/><br/> Server device 2208 includes a networking device 2220 and a server 2222.  Networking device 2220 may operate to communicate bi-directionally with global network 2206 via communication channel 2216 and with server 2222 via a communication channel
2224.  Server 2222 may operate to execute software instructions and store information.
<br/><br/> Network region 2202 includes a multiplicity of clients with a sampling denoted as a client 2226 and a client 2228.  Client 2226 includes a networking device 2234, a processor 2236, a GUI 2238 and an interface device 2240.  Non-limiting examples
of devices for GUI 2238 include monitors, televisions, cellular telephones, smartphones and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants).  Non-limiting examples of interface device 2240 include pointing device, mouse, trackball, scanner and printer.  Networking
device 2234 may communicate bi-directionally with global network 2206 via communication channel 2212 and with processor 2236 via a communication channel 2242.  GUI 2238 may receive information from processor 2236 via a communication channel 2244 for
presentation to a user for viewing.  Interface device 2240 may operate to send control information to processor 2236 and to receive information from processor 2236 via a communication channel 2246.  Network region 2204 includes a multiplicity of clients
with a sampling denoted as a client 2230 and a client 2232.  Client 2230 includes a networking device 2248, a processor 2250, a GUI 2252 and an interface device 2254.  Non-limiting examples of devices for GUI 2238 include monitors, televisions, cellular
telephones, smartphones and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants).  Non-limiting examples of interface device 2240 include pointing devices, mousse, trackballs, scanners and printers.  Networking device 2248 may communicate bi-directionally with global
network 2206 via communication channel 2214 and with processor 2250 via a communication channel 2256.  GUI 2252 may receive information from processor 2250 via a communication channel 2258 for presentation to a user for viewing.  Interface device 2254
may operate to send control information to processor 2250 and to receive information from processor 2250 via a communication channel 2260.
<br/><br/> For example, consider the case where a user interfacing with client 2226 may want to execute a networked application.  A user may enter the IP (Internet Protocol) address for the networked application using interface device 2240.  The IP address
information may be communicated to processor 2236 via communication channel 2246.  Processor 2236 may then communicate the IP address information to networking device 2234 via communication channel 2242.  Networking device 2234 may then communicate the
IP address information to global network 2206 via communication channel 2212.  Global network 2206 may then communicate the IP address information to networking device 2220 of server device 2208 via communication channel 2216.  Networking device 2220 may
then communicate the IP address information to server 2222 via communication channel 2224.  Server 2222 may receive the IP address information and after processing the IP address information may communicate return information to networking device 2220
via communication channel 2224.  Networking device 2220 may communicate the return information to global network 2206 via communication channel 2216.  Global network 2206 may communicate the return information to networking device 2234 via communication
channel 2212.  Networking device 2234 may communicate the return information to processor 2236 via communication channel 2242.  Processor 2246 may communicate the return information to GUI 2238 via communication channel 2244.  User may then view the
return information on GUI 2238.
<br/><br/> In the present embodiment, the software has a backend web dashboard that third-party developers 210 log into in order to manage the integration and parameters associated with their integrated game(s) 106 and contests 405.  The dashboard, without
limitation, may allow third-party developers 210 to perform functions such as create new contests, set parameters of contests 405, and view analytics of contests 405 held.  In a non-limiting example, the third-party developer 210 may set contest metrics
in determining winner, prize allocation and details.  In the present embodiment, through the dashboard, the third-party developer 210 may, without limitation, set the fee per attempt amount 410 for each contest 405, adjust the percent of each attempt fee
410 that goes toward jackpot 515 and revenue split 510 by the third-party developer 210 and the administrator 215, customize jackpot notification displays in their app, send a message to all users, send in-app notifications real-time, view player
analytics and other controls.  The dashboard 220 may provide the administrator 215 with an executive account that oversees and manages, without limitation, all the third-party developers 210 and player 102 accounts.  The administrator 215 may be able to
adjust accessibility rights for all parties on the platform, including freezing or terminating third-party developer 210 accounts.  The dashboard 220 also communicates with the SDK 104 and the transactional server 110 in order to maintain and display
real-time data.  In an alternate embodiment, dashboard 220 may communicate directly with gaming server 112.
<br/><br/> In the present embodiment, the web dashboard may have an analytics section that allows third-party developers 210, without limitation, to view contest and user participation data through, without limitation, the number of attempts made, the
amount wagered, the estimated revenue generated based on percentage set, and other metrics and graphs.  In the present embodiment, the analytics section may enable players 102 to view a complete detailed profile that includes, without limitation, the
player's 102 performance history, contests played, number of plays, amount wagered, attempt results and high scores, and the suggested contests and/or games based on historical data.  If a player 102 has synced one of their social media accounts, for
example, but not limited to, completing the sign-up process using a <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, Google+ account, or any other social media account or linking a social media account in the player's 102 profile settings, the player 102 may also view their friends
profiles and view how well they are performing.  In some embodiments, the player 102 may also import his or her email contacts to see which of his or her friends are members and automatically connect with them via the web dashboard 220.  In a
non-limiting example, a social graph that ranks a users' performance(s) against his/her friends' performance(s) within different games and contests may be viewed.  In another non-limiting example, players 102 may be able to view a news feed that lists
integrated games &amp; current contests with the progressive jackpot sizes across the platform.  In the present embodiment, the Administrator 215 may have the highest level of visibility in the analytics section.  The Administrator 215 may be enabled to find
out how the system is performing on the basis of different parameters, including, without limitation the following: number of attempts 405 made by players 102, number of contests created by third-party developer 210, the total money flow, adoption rates,
geographical distribution of players 102 and third-party developers 210, any exceptions or errors in the SDK 104 or web dashboard, response times of APIs, active player 102 counts, and screen wise dropouts.
<br/><br/> In the present embodiment, the web application may immediately update the milestones in the database and may recalculate the standings of each user.  In a non-limiting example, once data from an attempt 108 is received by the transactional
server 110, the web dashboard 220 may then refresh to include and display the most recent attempt 108 data and most updated version of a leaderboard 1605 along with all other pertinent contest 405 information and details 1030.  In the present embodiment,
to synchronize the platforms, the communications may utilize https to ensure each transaction is secured through SSL certificates.  When a third-party developer 210 intends to display and promote a custom version of the leaderboard of a contest, the API
may be provided to the third-party developer 210 in a JSON format to use for a custom leaderboard.  Otherwise, in the present embodiment, the third-party developer 210 may be provided with a generic UI to use one function of the SDK 104 to get the latest
leaderboard from the server using API.  In a non-limiting example, the UI leaderboard may be customizable to include colors and logo of the third-party developer 210.
<br/><br/> In the present embodiment, a contest winner is based on the predefined rules established through the parameters.  In a non-limiting example, the parameters may be start and end time, type of contest, metric used for ranking purposes such as, but
not limited to, fastest time, most points, most kills, etc., and an attempt fee amount 410.  The contest end is based upon the contest end-time parameter 410 with the winner(s) calculated by the web application.  In alternative embodiments, the end of
the contest may be based on when a player reaches a certain milestone, such as, but not limited to, a certain high score, instead of time.  As a non-limiting example, first one to get 40 kills in one attempt wins the progressive jackpot amount at that
point in time.  The results are pushed 900 using in-app notifications 1000, push notifications and email addresses.  Winner(s) account(s) may be credited with winning amount of the progressive jackpot based on the payout structure parameters 500
established in the web dashboard 220 and the associated payout with their position on the leaderboard.
<br/><br/> In the present embodiment, players 102 may be able to share statuses such as, without limitation, a current contest with jackpot amount, performance and/or attempt score, winnings, and other messages via social media, email, and SMS.
<br/><br/> In the present embodiment, the software automatically populates, updates, and keeps track of each contest 405 leaderboard 1605.  Each attempt 108 that is reported, either by the SDK 104 or by the third party gaming server 112, is graded or
ranked against all previous attempts 108 made in the contest 405, respectively.  The third party gaming server 112 and/or SDK 104 know which data from the attempt 108 results to report to server 110 because the parameters of the contest 405 were defined
by either the developer 210 or administrator 215 in the web dashboard 220.
<br/><br/> In the present embodiment, the SDK 104 may be optimal for use in online and mobile games of skill.  In a non-limiting example, games of skill are those in which a player 102 is ranked predominantly by in-game abilities as opposed to games whose
outcomes are predominantly dependent on chance.  In another non-limiting example, games of skill may include, without limitation, racing, sports, fighting, strategy, trivia, and word games.
<br/><br/> In the present embodiment, when the contest time 415 has expired, the contest 405 closes and players 102 may not able to enter the contest 405 by making another attempt 108; however, players 102 who entered the contest 405 before the contest
time expired 415 are given a preset extension of time to allow the player to finish the game attempt 108 and have the player's score reported and factored into the final leaderboard 1605 and prize ranking.  The preset extension is set in web dashboard
220.
<br/><br/> In the present embodiment, all players 102, developers 210, and administrator 215 accounts are universal amongst all integrated apps.  In a non-limiting example, if a user accesses their account playing Game A, the account, such as, but not
limited to, an account balance, if attempts were made, is updated and in sync when they go to play and enter contests in Game B.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, third party developers 210 may have the ability, via the web dashboard 220, to auto-repeat expired contests if desired or may create a new contest to begin as soon as the previous contest ends, or the option to not run a new
contest at all.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, third party developers 210 may create custom notifications that may be designed for and delivered to a developer's 210 user base via the web dashboard 220.  The custom notifications may, without limitation, notify users of
updates, such as deposit bonuses, jackpot statuses and/or an ad to participate in a contest including a link that directs them to the initial verification/authentication process.  Developers 210 may also set notifications to, without limitation, pop-up
automatically, interstitially throughout the game/app based on defined parameters as assigned in the web dashboard 220, and/or as a notification sent out to all of the participants and users notifying them of the end of the contest 405.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the software may deliver contests, notifications and updates to users via its own app, website, dashboard, or game.  In a non-limiting example, users interested in learning more about different contests and games that have
integrated the SDK 104 may download the app or visit the website that displays all running contests or upcoming contests in a contest lobby 700 and displays the status of each including, without limitation, the current jackpot amount 515 and the current
high score and leader 720.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, users may be directed to the contest lobby from a notification within a third party game which has integrated the SDK 104.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments the leaderboard 1605 is customizable by the developers 210 to help fit in with their game design.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the software may have listeners embedded throughout to monitor and report user interaction data including, without limitation, metrics and trip actions that notify the SDK 104, dashboard 220, and server 110 to perform a
certain action.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the SDK 104 may be linked, without limitation, to online gaming sites for skill and/or chance, apps and machines, sports or events wagering, arcade games, virtual reality games, auction apps and/or website and funding
platforms.  In a non-limiting example, funding platforms may include crowd funding sites.
<br/><br/> In an alternative embodiment, the SDK 104 may be linked with fantasy sports games.  In a non-limiting example, Yahoo Fantasy football may be linked to create a jackpot payout for specified leaders.
<br/><br/> In an alternative embodiment, user may register as "guests" to use the platform on a trial basis.
<br/><br/> Those skilled in the art will readily recognize, in light of and in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, that any of the foregoing steps and/or system modules may be suitably replaced, reordered, removed and additional steps
and/or system modules may be inserted depending upon the needs of the particular application, and that the systems of the foregoing embodiments may be implemented using any of a wide variety of suitable processes and system modules, and is not limited to
any particular computer hardware, software, middleware, firmware, microcode and the like.  For any method steps described in the present application that can be carried out on a computing machine, a typical computer system can, when appropriately
configured or designed, serve as a computer system in which those aspects of the invention may be embodied.
<br/><br/> It will be further apparent to those skilled in the art that at least a portion of the novel method steps and/or system components of the present invention may be practiced and/or located in location(s) possibly outside the jurisdiction of the
United States of America (USA), whereby it will be accordingly readily recognized that at least a subset of the novel method steps and/or system components in the foregoing embodiments must be practiced within the jurisdiction of the USA for the benefit
of an entity therein or to achieve an object of the present invention.  Thus, some alternate embodiments of the present invention may be configured to comprise a smaller subset of the foregoing means for and/or steps described that the applications
designer will selectively decide, depending upon the practical considerations of the particular implementation, to carry out and/or locate within the jurisdiction of the USA.  For example, any of the foregoing described method steps and/or system
components which may be performed remotely over a network (e.g., without limitation, a remotely located server) may be performed and/or located outside of the jurisdiction of the USA while the remaining method steps and/or system components (e.g.,
without limitation, a locally located client) of the forgoing embodiments are typically required to be located/performed in the USA for practical considerations.  In client-server architectures, a remotely located server typically generates and transmits
required information to a US based client, for use according to the teachings of the present invention.  Depending upon the needs of the particular application, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, in light of the teachings of the
present invention, which aspects of the present invention can or should be located locally and which can or should be located remotely.  Thus, for any claims construction of the following claim limitations that are construed under 35 USC .sctn.112 (6) it
is intended that the corresponding means for and/or steps for carrying out the claimed function are the ones that are locally implemented within the jurisdiction of the USA, while the remaining aspect(s) performed or located remotely outside the USA are
not intended to be construed under 35 USC .sctn.112 (6).  In some embodiments, the methods and/or system components which may be located and/or performed remotely include, without limitation: web site hosting and cloud storage for databases.
<br/><br/> It is noted that according to USA law 35 USC .sctn.112 (1), all claims must be supported by sufficient disclosure in the present patent specification, and any material known to those skilled in the art need not be explicitly disclosed.  However,
35 USC .sctn.112 (6) requires that structures corresponding to functional limitations interpreted under 35 USC .sctn.112 (6) must be explicitly disclosed in the patent specification.  Moreover, the USPTO's Examination policy of initially treating and
searching prior art under the broadest interpretation of a "mean for" claim limitation implies that the broadest initial search on 112 (6) functional limitation would have to be conducted to support a legally valid Examination on that USPTO policy for
broadest interpretation of "mean for" claims.  Accordingly, the USPTO will have discovered a multiplicity of prior art documents including disclosure of specific structures and elements which are suitable to act as corresponding structures to satisfy all
functional limitations in the below claims that are interpreted under 35 USC .sctn.112 (6) when such corresponding structures are not explicitly disclosed in the foregoing patent specification.  Therefore, for any invention element(s)/structure(s)
corresponding to functional claim limitation(s), in the below claims interpreted under 35 USC .sctn.112 (6), which is/are not explicitly disclosed in the foregoing patent specification, yet do exist in the patent and/or non-patent documents found during
the course of USPTO searching, Applicant(s) incorporate all such functionally corresponding structures and related enabling material herein by reference for the purpose of providing explicit structures that implement the functional means claimed. 
Applicant(s) request(s) that fact finders during any claims construction proceedings and/or examination of patent allowability properly identify and incorporate only the portions of each of these documents discovered during the broadest interpretation
search of 35 USC .sctn.112 (6) limitation, which exist in at least one of the patent and/or non-patent documents found during the course of normal USPTO searching and or supplied to the USPTO during prosecution.  Applicant(s) also incorporate by
reference the bibliographic citation information to identify all such documents comprising functionally corresponding structures and related enabling material as listed in any PTO Form-892 or likewise any information disclosure statements (IDS) entered
into the present patent application by the USPTO or Applicant(s) or any 3.sup.rd parties.  Applicant(s) also reserve its right to later amend the present application to explicitly include citations to such documents and/or explicitly include the
functionally corresponding structures which were incorporate by reference above.
<br/><br/> All the features disclosed in this specification, including any accompanying abstract and drawings, may be replaced by alternative features serving the same, equivalent or similar purpose, unless expressly stated otherwise.  Thus, unless
expressly stated otherwise, each feature disclosed is one example only of a generic series of equivalent or similar features.
<br/><br/> It is noted that according to USA law 35 USC .sctn.112 (1), all claims must be supported by sufficient disclosure in the present patent specification, and any material known to those skilled in the art need not be explicitly disclosed.  However,
35 USC .sctn.112 (6) requires that structures corresponding to functional limitations interpreted under 35 USC .sctn.112 (6) must be explicitly disclosed in the patent specification.  Moreover, the USPTO's Examination policy of initially treating and
searching prior art under the broadest interpretation of a "mean for" claim limitation implies that the broadest initial search on 112 (6) functional limitation would have to be conducted to support a legally valid Examination on that USPTO policy for
broadest interpretation of "mean for" claims.  Accordingly, the USPTO will have discovered a multiplicity of prior art documents including disclosure of specific structures and elements which are suitable to act as corresponding structures to satisfy all
functional limitations in the below claims that are interpreted under 35 USC .sctn.112 (6) when such corresponding structures are not explicitly disclosed in the foregoing patent specification.  Therefore, for any invention element(s)/structure(s)
corresponding to functional claim limitation(s), in the below claims interpreted under 35 USC .sctn.112 (6), which is/are not explicitly disclosed in the foregoing patent specification, yet do exist in the patent and/or non-patent documents found during
the course of USPTO searching, Applicant(s) incorporate all such functionally corresponding structures and related enabling material herein by reference for the purpose of providing explicit structures that implement the functional means claimed. 
Applicant(s) request(s) that fact finders during any claims construction proceedings and/or examination of patent allowability properly identify and incorporate only the portions of each of these documents discovered during the broadest interpretation
search of 35 USC .sctn.112 (6) limitation, which exist in at least one of the patent and/or non-patent documents found during the course of normal USPTO searching and or supplied to the USPTO during prosecution.  Applicant(s) also incorporate by
reference the bibliographic citation information to identify all such documents comprising functionally corresponding structures and related enabling material as listed in any PTO Form-892 or likewise any information disclosure statements (IDS) entered

functionally corresponding structures which were incorporate by reference above.
<br/><br/> Thus, for any invention element(s)/structure(s) corresponding to functional claim limitation(s), in the below claims, that are interpreted under 35 USC .sctn.112 (6), which is/are not explicitly disclosed in the foregoing patent specification,
Applicant(s) have explicitly prescribed which documents and material to include the otherwise missing disclosure, and have prescribed exactly which portions of such patent and/or non-patent documents should be incorporated by such reference for the
purpose of satisfying the disclosure requirements of 35 USC .sctn.112 (6).  Applicant(s) note that all the identified documents above which are incorporated by reference to satisfy 35 USC .sctn.112 (6) necessarily have a filing and/or publication date
prior to that of the instant application, and thus are valid prior documents to incorporated by reference in the instant application.
