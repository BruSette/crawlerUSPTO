including selection and legible display prevention of at least one copy of all stored user account object data in the subset of the user account object data. <hr/> <center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> The present disclosure relates to a computer-implemented method for one or more of increasing data processing efficiency and improving data security, of one or more computers communicatively connected to a digitally stored and operated social
network site computer network; and a terminal, a system and a computer-readable medium for the same.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Current attempts to control the shear amount, the digital manipulation, the aggregation, and the dissemination of sensitive personal information stored across computer-implemented social network site storage networks are resource, energy, and
time consuming.  These attempts consume resources, energy, and time--on all three of individual, organizational and large-and-mega-scale digital computer server and non-server networks.
<br/><br/> Some advocate abstinence or discontinued use, which negates the technological advantages of social network site computer networks.
<br/><br/> Others suggest sacrificing security by allowing all information to proliferate without reservation or with minimal reservation, which causes an overabundance of distributed content.
<br/><br/> Still others teach identification management by identifying Facebook.RTM.  and Twitter.RTM.  content containing text (e.g., profanity) or objects in photos (e.g., beer cans), which have been previously defined in a blacklist Blacklist techniques
suffer from several problems such as the inability to technically scale them for network-wide use, such that large volumes of data cannot be managed.  They also lead to false positives, wherein valued objects are unduly deleted.
<br/><br/> On an individual scale, it is estimated that, for example, an average <b><i>Facebook</i></b> user account stores nearly 8500 new data objects per year, which it is estimated would take more than two days to identify and delete on an item-by-item basis
assuming that it takes about 5 seconds to identify and remove each object.
<br/><br/> It would be desirable to provide a more effective method of creating more efficient digital privacy management, which would reduce the storage space required to store, the bandwidth to aggregate and calculate, and/or the computing resources,
time, and energy previously required, especially as regarding management of redundant and private, sensitive personal data.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> As used herein, an "account user terminal" is a terminal authorized, via a unique set of social network site account user-held access credentials, to control a particular social network site user data profile assigned or related to a particular
social network site account user.
<br/><br/> First and second aspects of the disclosure may or may not be directed to respective method and computer readable medium (or alternately throughout "computer storage apparatus") causing operations, for each comprising any one or more of:
collecting or accessing data uniquely representative of, or uniquely indicating, one or more social network site user account(s) and transmitting data necessary to access and control the one or more digitally stored and operated social network site user
account(s) to at least one computer(s); establishing direct or indirect communication access and linkage between the terminal and the at least one computer(s) on which are stored, or by which access is available to control, stored user account object
data that were input or modified during prior access to and control over the one or more social network site user account(s) or associated social network site user account(s) that at some prior time had permission to edit data in, or append data to, the
stored user account object data of the one or more social network site user account(s), the stored user account data of the one or more user account(s) uniquely accessible based on access data digitally pre-assigned to the one or more social network site
user account(s); displaying indicia, or broadcasting data, representative of or indicating one or more predetermined criteria for selecting a subset of the stored user account object data; collecting data representative of, or indicating, the subset of
the stored user account object data based on the one or more predetermined criteria for selecting the subset of the stored user account object data that were input or modified during prior access to and control over the one or more user account(s) or
associated social network site user account(s) that at some prior time had permission to edit data in, or append data to, the user account object data of the one or more user account(s); and transmitting instructions to prevent display of the subset of
the stored user account object data at every user account terminal in the social network site computer networks, according to the collected data representative of, or indicating, the one or more predetermined criteria for selecting the subset of the
stored user account object data, from the terminal to the at least one remote computer(s); wherein the instructions are calculated to prevent the display of the selected subset of the stored user account object data at at least one user account terminal
in the social network site computer network, based on the one or more predetermined criteria.
<br/><br/> Third and fourth aspects of the disclosure may or may not be directed to respective processor-based terminal and processor-based system, each comprising any one or more of: a first module arranged to collect or access data uniquely
representative of, or uniquely indicating, the one or more social network site user account(s) and transmitting data necessary to access and control the one or more digitally stored and operated social network site user account(s) to at least one remote
computer(s); a second module arranged to establish direct or indirect communication access and linkage between the terminal and the at least one remote computer(s) on which are stored, or by which access is available to control, stored user account
object data that were input or modified during prior access to and control over the one or more social network site user account(s) or associated social network site user account(s) that at some prior time had permission to edit data in, or append data
to, the stored user account object data of the one or more social network site user account(s), the stored user account data of the one or more user account(s) uniquely accessible based on access data digitally pre-assigned to the one or more social
network site user account(s); a third module arranged to display indicia, or broadcast data, representative of or indicating one or more predetermined criteria for selecting a subset of the stored user account object data; a forth module arranged to
collect data representative of, or indicating, the subset of the stored user account object data based on the one or more predetermined criteria for selecting the subset of the stored user account object data that were input or modified during prior
access to and control over the one or more user account(s) or associated social network site user account(s) that at some prior time had permission to edit data in, or append data to, the user account object data of the one or more user account(s); and a
fifth module arranged to transmit instructions to prevent display of the subset of the stored user account object data at every user account terminal in the social network site computer networks, according to the collected data representative of, or
indicating, the one or more predetermined criteria for selecting the subset of the stored user account object data, from the terminal to the at least one remote computer(s); wherein the instructions are calculated to prevent display of the selected
subset of the stored user account object data at at least one user account terminal of the social network site computer network, based on the one or more predetermined criteria.
<br/><br/> Additional or alternative aspects of the disclosure are found in the appended claims.  Further aspects, embodiments, features, and advantages of the embodiments, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments are described in

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the disclosure are concerned with the calculation of one or more data set transformation instructions, in certain cases the transmission of those instructions to at least one remote computer(s) (e.g., but not limited to, any
combination of one or more of, a bank of, and geographically disparate communicatively connected, server(s) that manipulate user data).  Ultimately, though not in certain method, terminal, system and computer-readable media embodiments, these
instructions may or may not also be executed at one or more server(s), storage device(s) or other computer hardware holding or capable of selectively preventing display of the data set(s) being operated on.
<br/><br/> The data available for viewing on a user account terminal of a social network site computer network are reduced by one or more of deleting data from one or more storage devices or data structures, restricting data transmission through the
network, disabling receipt of transmitted data, and non-legible display or data to one or more user account terminals in the social network site computer network.
<br/><br/> Though un-expectantly, it becomes apparent that data security and technological leveraging seemingly cannot coexist, creating a technically derived tension.  For example, the social network website, Facebook.RTM.  boasts about 829 million daily
active users.  Every day, these users upload more than 4.75 billion items of content (e.g., status updates, wall posts, photos, videos, comments, tags and other metadata), `like` more than 4.5 billion items, and send more than 10 billion messages,
--contributing to the 600 terabytes of data collected by Facebook.RTM.  every day.  This unprecedented deluge of information revelation can be attributed to the technical efficiencies provided by its particular digital interaction platform.  Other social
network sites present similar challenges, including but not limited to Twitter.RTM., LinkedIn.RTM., Instagram.RTM., Snapchat.RTM., etc.
<br/><br/> It is also realized un-expectantly that, yet, because the advantage of widespread identity revelations require an audience, leveraging the technical advances necessarily means relationships, which are impossible without others--sometimes others
who on a wide-scale network at some point tend to misuse or compromise such data.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, certain of the below-indicated non-limiting technical advantages and/or others, each of which depend upon what particular combination of features disclosed herein is found in an embodiment, are realized only upon persistent and
arduous study through both (a) discovering the very existence of the above-indicated technical tension, and (b) inventing the technical solutions disclosed in part herein.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, resulting deletion, non-transmission, non-receipt, or non-legible display, and/or non-display of user-designated private or personal data thereby frees up processing resources both at an individual level such as at a terminal,
and all the more so collectively, across even a global network of data storage and processing infrastructure facilitating the ebb and flow of personal and business related data of millions, if not even billions, of social network site users.  These
embodiments quite un-expectantly provide the unpredictable result(s) of reducing unwanted, unnecessary, and privacy-compromising data flow to and from various terminals and other computers communicatively connected to one or more digitally stored and
operated social network site(s).
<br/><br/> In embodiments, operations by which data set transformations are made improve data security by preserving or reclaiming the privacy of certain user account data objects.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, operations by which data set transformations are made increase system operational efficiency at each terminal.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, operations by which data set transformations are made strike an optimal balance between improving data security by preserving or reclaiming the privacy of certain user account data objects on the one hand, and increasing system
operational efficiency, on the other hand, all the while allowing continued data exchange and aggregation between one or more user computers communicatively connected to at least one digitally stored and operated social network site.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, the outcomes (alternately or additionally) affect quite unpredictable technical advantages of continued connectivity to one or more such sites (full utilization of these sites' own inherent communication and data transfer
efficiencies), while reducing the computing time and energy required to receive individual or step-by-step implementations of merely small batch instructions to remove or otherwise secure relatively very little user account information.
<br/><br/> The following describes a system for managing social networking site computer network data, according to embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 1-5.  FIG. 1 is a diagram of computer network 451 including three exemplary environments, in which
embodiments may be implemented.  While the following is described in terms of FIG. 1, the embodiments are not limited to the environment(s) illustrated in FIG. 1.  For example, any system having generally the structure of FIG. 1, or that would benefit
from the operation, methods and functions as described herein may be used.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, system 451 shows terminal clients 201-251 each or collectively comprising one or more browser(s) 10 of terminal 247 (browser also in each of other terminals, but not shown), which is/are used to connect to server(s) 500
over one or more networks W13, W14, and W15.
<br/><br/> According to embodiments, browser 10 may include any device, application or module that enables a user or computer to navigate and/or retrieve data from another data source, typically over a network.  Browser 10 may include any conventional web
browser such as those that are widely available.  According to further embodiments, browser 10 may also be configured to use any number of protocols, known now or developed in the future, including protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and underlying protocols
such as TCP/IP or UDP.  In embodiments, browser 10 is configured to run (or execute) web applications without a GUI as a headless browser.  Web applications are applications that can be hosted within a web browser or those that can be accessed, for
example, over a network such as the Internet or an intranet.
<br/><br/> Browser 10 can further communicate with an input (not shown) to allow a user to input data, to input commands, or to provide other control information to browser 10.  Browser 10 may request content from one or more server(s) 50, based on prior
user input that is stored at one or more terminal(s) or server(s) 50 before accessing server(s) 50, and upon which instructions later sent to server 50 are calculated.  Server(s) 50 may respond to the request by providing content back to browser 10 and
client 201 via network W13.  Browser 10 may also be configured to retrieve content from server(s) 50 without user intervention.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, network(s) W13, W14, and W15 can be any type of data network or combination of data networks including, but not limited to, a local area network (LAN) accessed locally or remotely such as via a VPN, a medium area network, or a
wide area network such as the Internet.  Network W13, for example, can be a wired or wireless network that allows client 247 and server(s) 50 to communicate with each other.  Network W13 can further support world-wide-web (e.g., Internet) protocols and
services.
<br/><br/> Server(s) 50 provides content (e.g., web pages, applications (or "apps"), audio, video, etc.) that can be retrieved by client 247 over network W13.  Content retrieved by client 247 can be disseminated via browser 10.  In various embodiments,
server(s) 50 and/or browser 10 includes one or more features of content manager 200, which is described further below.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 1, in embodiments, terminal and/or system data flow configurations selectively delete (or otherwise prevent(s) legible display of) user account data with an unexpected technical efficiency not previously seen, in view of
the above seemingly irreconcilable tensions.  A base functional component of one aspect of the disclosure is composed of at least one of a plurality of terminals 201 to 251, configured to be ordered by predetermined default settings or user-selected
settings and/or software instructions into one or more dynamically changing and rearranging user terminal groupings.  Certain network terminals and/or systems, e.g., system 451, connect and allow exchange of information between local or far flung
terminals within and from at least, but not limited to, three distinct types of networks W13, W14, and W15.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, terminal group 401 comprises terminals 201 to 215, terminal group 403 comprises terminals 217 to 233, and terminal group 405 comprises terminals 235 to 251, each group and collective groups illustrating flow of data, albeit on a
very small scale, among and across varied networks, such as clear network W13, darknet or darkweb W14 (e.g., employed via The Onion Router (Tor)), and peer-to-peer network W15 via at least one (or more) server(s) 50.  Server(s) 50 receive, store,
retrieve and deliver, across and at numerous and geographically disparate locations, user account data on one or more databases 600.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, terminal and system operations may or may not in whole or in part be effectuated, executed, or implemented on or via clear network W13 (comprising at least all of, or just a portion of, terminal groups 403 and 405) whereby
individual terminals, server(s) 50, or a combination thereof, calculate the actions to be taken on respective data sets, and propagate(s) those actions out to the network via server(s) 50 and beyond to all other users.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, terminal and system operations may or may not in whole or in part effectuated, executed, or implemented on or via dark net W14 (comprising at least all of, or just a portion of, terminal groups 401 and 405) whereby individual
terminals, server(s) 50, or a combination thereof calculate the actions to be taken on respective data sets, and propagate(s) those actions out to the network via server(s) 50 and beyond to all other users.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, terminal and system operations may or may not in whole or in part effectuated, executed, or implemented on or via a peer to peer network W15 (comprising at least all of, or just a portion of, terminal groups 401 and 403) whereby
one or more terminals, server(s) 50, or a combination thereof, calculate the actions to be taken on respective data sets, and propagate(s) those actions out to the network.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, server(s) 50 execute instructions for user account data deletion after a retention period--and not immediately upon server(s) 50 receiving the instructions to delete certain data from one or more terminals, and/or not immediately
upon terminal(s) receiving the instructions to delete certain data at one or more terminals.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, at least one of terminals 201 to 251 transmit instructions to server(s) 50 to execute instructions causing successful deletion of associated user account object data from database(s) 600.  In turn, associated account terminals,
such as used by "friends" on Facebook.RTM., may (or may not) receive alerting data indicating the effectiveness of one or more of the herein disclosed embodiments, thereby creating an acceleration and scaling of at least several of the technical
advantages of various herein disclosed embodiments.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, each terminal may or may not be geographically remote from or local to the computers that access and control the storage devices on which social network site user data are stored.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, each terminal may or may not be part of one or more device set(s), the one or more device set(s) that may or may not comprising only one or multiple-single user, entity (e.g., informal group) or participant-controlled, owned or
used device(s).
<br/><br/> In embodiments, any one or more of these terminal(s) or device set(s) may or may not include for example remote log-on and/or remote usage via any Web-capable device to a Web-based ASP or peer-to-peer decentralized network even though device
ownership, possession and/or control is only temporary and/or through established via other-user-owned or installed applications, such as by embedded or remote implementation via a widely used social media site application or website.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, client terminal 247 and server 50 can each be implemented on a computing device.  Such a computing device includes, but is not limited to, a personal computer, mobile device such as a mobile phone, workstation, embedded system,
game console, television, set-top box, or any other computing device that can support web browsing.  Such a computing device may include, but is not limited to, a device having a processor and memory for executing and storing instructions.  Such a
computing device may include software, firmware, and hardware.  The computing device may also have multiple processors and multiple shared or separate memory components.  Software may include one or more applications and an operating system.  Hardware
can include, but is not limited to, a processor, memory and graphical user interface display.  An optional input device, such as a mouse or touch screen, may be used.
<br/><br/> Software Modules
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates content manager 200, according to embodiments.  Content manager 200 may include one or more modules 1, 3, 5, and 7.  The term "module" as used herein shall mean software, such as instructions or code, but not hardware, such as
a semiconductor hardwired logic circuit in a processor.
<br/><br/> Content manager 200 enables embodiments to delete server 50 and/or database 600 content selections.  In embodiments, content manager 200 can be implemented in server 50 (e.g., as a server side component).  In other embodiments, content manager
200 can be implemented in browser 10.  In yet other embodiments, content manager 200 can be implemented in both server 50 and browser 10.  As shown in FIG. 2, content manager 200 may or may not include, access module 1, deletion indicia collection module
3, deletion module 5, and calculation module 7.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, access module 1 optionally includes displaying or broadcasting a request for credentials to access a social network site user account 11.  It then may include accessing and/or collecting data representing the account or accounts
such as credentials 13.  It may also include transmitting or receiving instructions to create a communication link between the relevant social network owned, controlled and/or operated servers and/or social network site owned, controlled or operated
databases on which a social network site stores user data on one hand, and a terminal used to access the site on the other hand, in accordance with an embodiment herein disclosed 15.  It may also include communication and data transfer to access both
objects uploaded to the social network site by a user and/or friends, or one or more users associated by the site to the account user 17.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, the displaying, broadcasting and or transmitting instructions to obtain or access user account credentials may be made from any one or more of an account user operated and/or controlled terminal, a third party operated and/or
controlled terminal, and a social network site operated and controlled terminal or server(s).
<br/><br/> As used herein, display or displaying are respectively a type of broadcast or a type of broadcasting, and broadcast and broadcasting each include any digital data signal transduction into one or more readily-understandable-by-human form, and
which may be limited to broadcast by only one device or more than one device.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, indicia collection module 3 includes display or broadcast of indicia or data that seek entry of what type of criteria are to be used to determine what account object data are to be deleted 19.  It may then include collecting or
searching for object data that meet the criteria selected 21.  It may then determine whether all such data are collected by verifying through a secondary search on a webserver portal such as Google.RTM.  and comparing the collected data with what is
found in the secondary search 23.  If not, the request for what type of data is to be deleted 19 and the search and collection 21 are performed again.  Once no additional secondary (or subsequent) search object data are found or identified, the results
of the items in terms of their type identity, upload and/or storage-date marking, size, and/or total number of items, may be calculated and/or stored in a data structure, such as in a table in a store at the terminal (or local to the data and/or under
the control of the social network site operators) 25.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, deletion module 5 may include preparing instructions to delete data including, but not necessarily limited to, all text objects defined according to the deletion criteria 27, all photographic objects defined according to the
deletion criteria 29 and all video objects defined according to the deletion criteria 31.  Module 5 may determine if all objects previously and optionally stored in, for example, a terminal data structure table are identified in the transmitted
instructions 33, and if not, another request for the desired deletion criteria is solicited 19 to confirm what objects are to be deleted, followed by reprocessing.  If all stored objects types or identities are accounted for deletion module 5 may then
transmit the requests to delete and display that requests to delete the objects have been transmitted 56, or continue to further optionally to calculate what objects to delete in accordance with the specific requirements of the social network site to
delete at least one copy of the selected objects.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, calculation module 7 may include specific calculation in accordance with specific API and other requirements particular to each social network site computer network, which may vary over time, vary from object to object, vary from
object type to object type, vary from O/S to O/S, and/or vary from account user to account user.  These calculations may include, for example, separate determinations for text 35, photographs 37, and videos 39.  The required calculation(s) (such as a
particular set of instructions) may be available only internally to the operators of the social network site, to account users, and/or to the public at large, for example.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, calculation module 7 may for example cause a terminal(s), upon failure to remove one or more data object(s), to report the failure to one or more update computer(s) (either operated and/or controlled by or not operated and/or
controlled by those who operate and/or control the social network site), e.g., but not limited to one or more of Google.RTM.  Analytics server(s).  These failure results may be one or more of digitally corrected by widely broadcasting update(s) (e.g.,
pushing out a revised version of instructions) such as to non-limiting content manager 300 below.  User notification(s) of the update(s) may or may not occur in either foreground or background embodiments.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, where a social network site computer network server or database data undergo change(s), e.g., in one or more data structures, thereby causing failure(s), instructions from one or more terminal(s) cause broadcasting of
report of the failure to one or more of (1) other use terminal(s) and (2) the one or more update computer(s), either (a) on the social network site computer network or (b) interfacing with one or more computers that are one or more of never, previously,
currently, and subsequently, on the social network computer network.  In embodiments, update instructions transmitted by the one or more update computer(s) may be broadcast via, e.g., but not limited to, Google.RTM.  Play and Apple.RTM.  App Store.
<br/><br/> For example, in one or more of both foreground and background mode(s), when a calculating module or other module(s) encounter(s) one or more change to Facebook.RTM.'s website that prevents execution of data deletion or other instruction, one or
more error description(s) of the problem(s) is/are transmitted to one or more update server.
<br/><br/> Such description(s) may include, but need not include nor be limited to include, transmission of metadata such as regarding date, time, application version number for a particular terminal O/S (e.g., Android or iOS) and/or level or type of
service.
<br/><br/> For example, instructions to perform a task of one or more module from the terminal(s) have corresponding specific instructions that may or may not vary from, that may or may not depend on, and/or that may or may not be based on, one or more
metadata characteristic(s), such as the O/S or other characteristics of each terminal or set of terminals found in a current or prior report associated with that terminal(s).  These variances and characteristics for example may or may not include, when a
terminal transmits instructions requesting action at Facebook.RTM.  servers, those instructions/request(s) may be based on an expectation that the request should contain certain pieces of information to have an intended effect.
<br/><br/> In particular non-limiting embodiments, instructions may or may not include determining whether the expected one or more piece(s) of information are present in the instructions.  If so, then instructions proceed.  If not, at least one error
report is calculated and/or transmitted from the terminal(s) that fail to send (directly or indirectly) successful instructions, to the update computer(s).
<br/><br/> In embodiments, if determining whether the expected one or more piece(s) of information are not present in the instructions, at least one error report is calculated and/or transmitted from a computer(s) other than the terminal(s) that fail to
send (directly or indirectly) successful instructions (e.g., from computer(s) on which one or more of text, terminal model and/or O/S-specific features of error report, etc., are stored), to the update computer(s).  Where many common sets of terminal
instructions--for example, regarding massive numbers of data objects deleted according to instructions from the same or like-featured phone or O/S-specific web application--confront the same basic failures for the same basic reasons; having such
designated first party, second party or third party servers will help allow scaling.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, instructions, e.g. to connect to or select data from a general or specific data structure of Facebook.RTM.'s server or database, that do not receive a response or otherwise fail (after analysing a response to request access or
data), cause further instructions to transmit an error report.  In embodiments, problem description(s) and/or reports may be in part or in whole, pre-defined and pre-stored based on any one or more of (but not limited to), pre-defined message(s)
describing the problem, filename(s) containing the instruction(s) that led to the error(s), and the line number(s) in the filename containing the instruction(s) that led to the error(s).  If an error arises, then the module(s) may or may not proceed.
<br/><br/> In foreground or background mode embodiments, the terminal(s) may present a terminal user(s) with the message "This app is currently unavailable." In alternate foreground or background mode embodiments, terminal(s) may or may not ignore some
errors and reschedule the task for a later time, until one or module instructions are patched before a next run (see below).
<br/><br/> In embodiments, when an update computer(s) (e.g., Google.RTM.  Analytics) receives an error report from a user terminal(s), the update computer(s) sends the report(s) to another terminal(s) (optionally one or more of never, previously, currently
and subsequently) on the social network site computer network, indicating the error(s) and/or source of the error(s).  This error report(s) is then used to identify one or more of the precise module instruction(s) that fail to work.  One or more module
may or may not be updated by one or more module that recalculate instructions to create patch or new module instructions, which are distributed to user terminal(s), e.g. as a new version available (e.g., but not limited to, via Google.RTM.  Play for
Android or Apple.RTM.  App Store).
<br/><br/> In embodiments, a terminal's O/S will periodically check for app updates (e.g., via Google.RTM.  Play or Apple.RTM.  App Store) and may automatically download and install such updates.  Hence, by creating and distributing new module version(s)
to user terminal(s), terminal(s) include up-to-date versions of modules.  It follows that many terminal users will never know that modules encountered a problem, because module(s) will be automatically or manually fixed before a user notices any failure.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, one or more modules include at least one reporting mechanism instructions to manage statistics, e.g., a module reports how many statuses have been deleted, to Google.RTM.  Analytics.
<br/><br/> In alternate or additional embodiments, a terminal operating system automatically discovers the revised instructions transmitted due to the failure(s) and update the instructions on the terminal.
<br/><br/> After (or as soon as) calculating module 7 instructions for one or more of connecting to, accessing or selecting data at, and deleting data from, a social network site server/database are calculated and transmitted, a secondary search is made on
the social network site, either immediately or at a time appropriate to account for any time delay caused by a particular social network site in deleting objects, to verify whether each object is deleted 41.  If not, the process begins again with any
aspect of indicia collection module 3.  If so, a message to broadcast to the user to indicate any expected time delay, as necessary 9.
<br/><br/> Once complete deletion is independently verified, a message is displayed or otherwise broadcast to indicate successful object deletion 56.  In alternate embodiments, partial success, and for example, object by object reporting may be broadcast
to a user.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, any one or more of the modules above or other modules in accordance with other embodiments, may alternately be replaced by individual means for performing one or more functions of the modules, steps, and individual features
disclosed herein.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, objects are deleted based on how long ago they are posted to an account.  The terminal displays an adjustable object retention selection period.  For instance, it can be variously extended as recently as one day, and as far back
in time as 10 or even 20 years, though any time in years, months, days may be selected.  Selection and setting of the retention time affects what objects are deleted, such that all objects or all objects of a certain type are subjected to deletion when
an instruction to delete objects is transmitted to the at least one remote or local servers or storage devices on which the objects are stored.
<br/><br/> Non-limiting examples of object data that may be deleted include account user status text, videos, photographs, and URLs originally self-uploaded by an account user to an individual user account (which may or may not be reported to other user
accounts), and account user-identifying tags that are associated with photographic or video content.  Non-limiting specific examples are one or more of photographs and/or accompanying text object(s); videos and/or accompanying text object(s); URLs and/or
accompanying text object(s); self-posted comments and other user comments on status text objects, videos, photographs, and URLs.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, after objects are deleted instructions may be transmitted to search for the deleted object(s) either individually, immediately after its deletion is instructed, or only after all objects in the selected subset are deleted.  In
accordance with whether an object is found, a notification is displayed or broadcast, accounting for each undeleted and/or deleted object is, either collectively or individually (on an object-by-object basis).
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates method 300, which is an exemplary overall operation of content manager 200, according to embodiments in one or more terminal (or alternately in one or more server, or in any combination thereof).  The following workflow can,
for example, be instantiated solely or collectively by any combination of instructions from one or more of an app GUI, and the terminal's O/S (as a background process).  In embodiments, categories of object data to be deleted are loaded from a storage
device (step 1), if previously stored.  (At first or subsequent installation of content manager 200 the steps of method 300, username and password or other social network site credentials may be previously obtained and stored in the terminal or a remote
store, for example before a terminal is disconnected and reconnected to the social network site computer network).  Whether deletion categories are marked or selected is determined (step 3).  If not, the terminal displays or otherwise broadcasts that no
items are marked for deletion (step 5).  Then, the terminal receives input of data that indicate or select what categories of data are to be deleted.  (step 7), and such categories are again loaded or otherwise accessed.
<br/><br/> If the deletion categories (and/or non-default retention period) are successfully accessed, whether a network connection is established is determined (step 9).  If no network connected is established, the terminal displays or otherwise
broadcasts that the network is unavailable (step 11) and optionally continues to determine whether the network connection is established, until it is established.
<br/><br/> After (or as soon as) a network connection is established, method 300 determines whether a user subscription is current and available (step 13).  If not, then the terminal displays or otherwise broadcasts that the subscription is not current
(step 15) and the method waits to proceed until the subscription is up-to-date in payment and having valid standing and or updates.
<br/><br/> If the application subscription is current and valid, the method determines if errors are to be handled (step 17) and if so the terminal displays or otherwise broadcasts instructions to re-enter relevant missing or incorrect information (step
19).  These and other error determination(s) may alternately be performed at any one or more earlier or later stage(s), be variously repeated, and/or be split into various types and performed separately or concurrently at once or at various stages and in
various orders.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, error handling may alternately or additionally include, optionally at any terminal user's option, reporting to a server information such as metadata about batch or specific object data related failed connections or tasks
regarding any one or more of the steps (or features of steps) undertaken by method 300.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, though not required in the same sequence as method 300, access to a social network site user account is initiated (step 21), either by acquiring social network site access (such as, but not limited to, login user name and
password) credentials at a GUI or by accessing preloaded or pre-stored access credentials from a store (located in the terminal or from an external device such as a remote store).
<br/><br/> Method 300 then determines whether the credentials are defined, i.e. are stored as a set of user credentials associated with content manager 200 or the subscription (step 23).  If not, the terminal displays or otherwise broadcasts that no
credentials are found, entered or exist (step 25).  If so, the retention period defined by the user and stored in the terminal or elsewhere are loaded, or a default retention period is loaded if no user-supplied value is stored, accessed or retrieved
(step 27)
<br/><br/> In embodiments, social network site access credentials are transmitted to servers or databases on which access permission may be granted, to authenticate and establish digital communication connection with the social network site server(s) (step
29).  This step (and/or other steps) may be performed directly from one terminal to a server or indirectly from a terminal to several other terminals or servers.  In embodiments, method 300 sends requests that search for items not dated within the
designated retention period (step 31).  In embodiments, found objects that fall outside of the retention period are deleted from the store, such as database 600, on which they are stored (step 33).
<br/><br/> Steps 29, 31, and 33 differ depending on each social network site accessed and managed.  In an exemplary method regarding a Facebook.RTM.  account, a headless browser performs step 29.  Then, the method searches for the designated or selected
objects using either Facebook.RTM.'s API or headless browsing.  Finally, headless browsing is used to delete items identified in the search.  The precise way in which objects are deleted will depend upon the object type, e.g., deletion of a user name
photograph tag will differ from status update texts on Facebook.RTM..
<br/><br/> In embodiments, method 300 includes causing the terminal to display or otherwise broadcast results of the prior steps (step 35).
<br/><br/> In embodiments, the sequence of the above steps may be altered as suitable to achieve any one or more of the functionality and effects indicated herein.  For example, collection of access information such as login credentials may occur
intermittently between instructions being sent to server 50 (or database 600 if via a LAN).
<br/><br/> In embodiments, various steps and various combinations of features of steps of content manager 200 may be running in the same or different sequences, either in the foreground or background.  If, for example, running in the foreground, all
feedback is provided directly to a user via the content manager's 200 GUI as data are deleted, for example on an object-by-object basis.  When content manager 200 is running in the background, all feedback is provided via a phone or PC O/S, for example
after all data within a manually set expiration date are deleted.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, more (or less) detailed feedback may be provided in the foreground mode, because a GUI provides a relatively higher (or lower)-bandwidth channel.  By comparison, feedback may be more limited (or less limited) in background mode,
because an O/S provides a relatively lower (or higher)-bandwidth information channel (e.g., limiting display of results and updates to one to a few lines of text).
<br/><br/> System and Digital Communications Network Hardware
<br/><br/> Another aspect of the disclosure is a computer system.  Referring to FIG. 4 and according to at least one embodiment, the techniques described herein are implemented by one or more special-purpose computing devices.  The special-purpose
computing devices may be hard-wired to perform the techniques, or may include digital electronic devices such as one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) that are persistently programmed to
perform the techniques, or may include one or more general purpose hardware processors programmed to perform the techniques pursuant to program instructions in firmware, memory, other storage, or a combination.  Such special-purpose computing devices may
also combine custom hard-wired logic, ASICs, or FPGAs with custom programming to accomplish the techniques.  The special-purpose computing devices may be desktop computer systems, portable computer systems, handheld devices, networking devices or any
other device that incorporates hard-wired and/or program logic to implement the techniques.
<br/><br/> For example, FIG. 4 is a block diagram that illustrates a computer system 500 upon which an embodiment may be implemented.  Computer system 500 includes a bus 502 or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a hardware
processor 504 coupled with bus 502 for processing information.  Hardware processor 504 may be, for example, a general purpose microprocessor.
<br/><br/> Computer system 500 also includes a main memory 506, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to bus 502 for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor 504.  Main memory 506 also may be
used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor 504.  Such instructions, when stored in non-transitory storage media accessible to processor 504, render computer system
500 into a special-purpose machine that is customized to perform the operations specified in the instructions.
<br/><br/> Computer system 500 further includes a read only memory (ROM) 508 or other static storage device coupled to bus 502 for storing static information and instructions for processor 504.  A storage device 510, such as a magnetic disk or optical
disk, is provided and coupled to bus 502 for storing information and instructions.
<br/><br/> Computer system 500 may be coupled via bus 502 to a display 512, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user.  An input device 514, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus 502 for
communicating information and command selections to processor 504.  Another type of user input device is cursor control 516, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to
processor 504 and for controlling cursor movement on display 512.  This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.
<br/><br/> Computer system 500 may implement the techniques described herein using customized hard-wired logic, one or more ASICs or FPGAs, firmware and/or program logic which in combination with the computer system causes or programs computer system 500
to be a special-purpose machine.  According to at least one embodiment, the techniques herein are performed by computer system 500 in response to processor 504 executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory 506. 
Such instructions may be read into main memory 506 from another storage medium, such as storage device 510.  Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory 506 causes processor 504 to perform the process operations described herein. 
In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions.
<br/><br/> The terms "storage media" and "storage device" as used herein refer to any non-transitory media that store data and/or instructions that cause a machine to operate in a specific fashion.  Such storage media may comprise non-volatile media and/or
volatile media.  Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device 510.  Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory 506.  Common forms of storage media include, for example, a floppy disk, a
flexible disk, hard disk, solid state drive, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic data storage medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical data storage medium, any physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, NVRAM, any other
memory chip or cartridge.
<br/><br/> Storage media and storage device are distinct from but may be used in conjunction with transmission media.  Transmission media participates in transferring information between storage media/devices.  For example, transmission media includes
coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus 502.  Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red data communications.
<br/><br/> Various forms of media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor 504 for execution.  For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk or solid state drive of a remote
computer.  The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem.  A modem local to computer system 500 can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red
transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal.  An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus 502.  Bus 502 carries the data to main memory 506, from which
processor 504 retrieves and executes the instructions.  The instructions received by main memory 506 may optionally be stored on storage device 510 either before or after execution by processor 504.
<br/><br/> Computer system 500 also includes a communication interface 518 coupled to bus 502.  Communication interface 518 provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link 520 that is connected to a local network 522.  For example,
communication interface 518 may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, cable modem, satellite modem, or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line.  As another example, communication
interface 518 may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN.  Wireless links may also be implemented.  In at least one such implementation, communication interface 518 sends and receives one or more
of electrical, electromagnetic and optical signals (as with all uses of "one or more" herein implicitly including any combination of one or more of these) that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.
<br/><br/> Network link 520 typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices.  For example, network link 520 may provide a connection through local network 522 to a host computer 524 or to data equipment operated by
an Internet Service Provider (ISP) 526.  ISP 526 in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the "Internet" 528.  Local network 522 and Internet 528 both use
electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams.  The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link 520 and through communication interface 518, which carry the digital data to and from computer
system 500, are example forms of transmission media.
<br/><br/> Computer system 500 can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link 520 and communication interface 518.  In at least one embodiment of the Internet example, a server 530 might transmit a
requested code for an application program through Internet 528, ISP 526, local network 522 and communication interface 518.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, the received code may be one or more of executed by processor 504 as it is received, and/or stored in storage device 510, or other non-volatile storage for later execution.
<br/><br/> Now referring to FIG. 5, in at least one embodiment a device used in accordance with this disclosure is or comprises mobile display or touch screen input smart phone or tablet 535, which is shown displaying direct user-to-device input message
text and or image(s), or remotely received message text and/or image(s) 540.
<br/><br/> Computer-Readable Medium
<br/><br/> Another aspect of the disclosure is one or more computer-readable media (or computer storage apparatus) having a program, which when executed by one or more processors, such part of one or more of the systems described herein, causes the one or
more processors to enable, allow or cause devices to perform any one of the methods as variously comprising any one or more of its various embodiments or sub-embodiments described above or otherwise covered by the appended claims.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, the one or more computer-readable media are non-transitory media such as, but not limited to HDD and SSD disk drives, thumb and other flash drives, DVDs, CDs, various static and dynamic storage devices and other numerous storage
media.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, the one or more computer-readable media comprise or are one or more transitory electronic signals.
