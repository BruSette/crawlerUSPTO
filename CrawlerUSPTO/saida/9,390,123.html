     collection and real-time injection
</font><br/>
       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> In one aspect, data, such as information articles, is sorted and
     prioritized based on a plurality of factors, such as user interest and
     popularity of data with respect to other users. The data is sorted by
     initial personal (i.e., user) data, sorted by the most relevant to the
     user, while passive interaction data is used to continually reorder the
     articles in real-time, while new stories are being injected into the
     stream in real time, all while other articles are increasing/decreasing
     in stature based on popularity with regard to other users and time decay.
     As such, the system provides that the information is fed to users in an
     efficient manner, in a manner based on time relevance, assumed interest
     with regard to that given user based on past actions by that user or
     information otherwise known about that user, as well as interest in the
     articles demonstrated by other users.

<br/><br/> The present invention generally relates to data and/or information collection, sorting and presentation.
<br/><br/> A problem generally encountered by publishers is, while much information (such as information files, including articles, videos, audios, images, and the like) may have been collected or is otherwise in possession of the publisher, the publisher
must determine the best and the most suitable information and manner to present such information to a given user.  For example, a user who has no interest in politics would not be well-served by a publisher to be bombarded with news stories about
politics.  In contrast, a user who is a sports fanatic would be well-served by a publisher to be presented with interesting stories about sports.  While a publisher can certainly request that a user complete a questionnaire to identify interests in
advance of presenting that user with stories and/or other information, or request that a user provide feedback after reading an article, such methods are cumbersome and may not be appreciated by all users.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> An objective of an embodiment of the present subject matter, including the systems, media, devices, methods, and platforms described herein, is to provide an efficient and effective manner of sorting and presenting information to a user.  To
avoid the time-consuming, inefficient and ineffective traditional information collection and information sorting which relies largely on papers (e.g., newspapers or magazines), the subject matter disclosed herein provides a novel computing application to
collect information from all publishers.  For example, after collection, the system identifies the best match information with the user.  In certain embodiments, the system is based on novel computational algorithms and mobile technologies which
transform the traditional information collection and collection into mobile, real-time, on-the-go, and ubiquitous.
<br/><br/> Specifically, in one embodiment of the present invention, one or more information processing servers are used to collect data (such as files, including news stories, images, videos, and audios, etc.) from a plurality of sources.  These sources
may include, but may not be limited to, RSS feeds, application program interfaces (API's) from publishers, and data from social media (such as Twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> and Instagram).  The information processing server(s) assigns attributes (such as location,
popularity, etc.) to the data, and stores the data and attributes in one or more databases.  Also stored in the one or more databases (or one or more other databases) is information about individual users, such as user preferences and other user-related
information.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, users are provided access to one or more applications, such as access to an application which may be loaded by the user onto computing device, such as a desktop computer, a mobile or tablet device.  A user then uses the
application to request information from the system.  This request is received by one or more computers running one or more API's, and articles, images, videos, audios, etc. stored in the one or more databases are matched up and delivered to that
particular user.
<br/><br/> Regarding which information, including articles and the like are delivered to a given user, the data is preferably sorted and prioritized based on a plurality of factors, such as user interest and popularity of data with respect to other users. 
Preferably, information articles are graphed or sorted by initial personal (i.e., user) data, sorted by the most relevant to the user, while passive interaction data is used to continually reorder the articles in real-time, while new stories are being
injected into the stream in real time, all while other articles are increasing/decreasing in stature based on popularity with regard to other users and time decay.  In the embodiments where information images, audios and/or videos are being presented,
one or more snapshots are graphed or sorted by initial personal (i.e., user) data, sorted by the most relevant to the user; the same passive interaction data is used to continually reorder the articles in real-time, while new images/audios/videos are
being injected into the stream in real time, all while other images/audios/videos are increasing or decreasing in stature based on popularity with regard to other users and time decay.  As such, the systems, methods, media, devices, and platforms
described herein provide that information, such as articles, which are fed to users in an efficient manner, in a manner based on time relevance, assumed interest with regard to that given user based on past actions by that user or information otherwise
known about that user, as well as interest in the articles demonstrated by other users.

<br/><br/> System Design
<br/><br/> Traditionally, information collection and information sorting relied largely on newspapers or magazines.  Publishers publish information on paper-based newspapers or magazines, and the subscribers purchased or subscribed the newspapers or
magazines of interest.  However, when the information becomes too expansive, it is not efficient, practical or even possible to subscribe all the newspapers or magazines of interest to a user, nor is it workable for the user to view each and every single
piece of information (articles, videos, audios, and the like).  The inventor has identified a new way to collect and sort information of interest to a user, which is the subject matter of this application.  The subject matter disclosed herein is based on
a computer-implemented system, methods, devices, and platforms.  In contrast to the traditional manner, which cannot collect and sort all the information from all publishers or efficiently provide it to the user, the computer-implemented systems,
methods, media, devices, and platforms disclosed herein, in certain applications, collects and sorts all relevant information.  Furthermore, unlike the traditional methods that take an exorbitant amount of time for information collection and sorting, the
systems, methods, media, devices, and platforms described herein, in certain applications, are instantaneous or require only seconds.  Moreover, it is impossible for the traditional, paper-based collection and sorting to identify interested information
with high accuracy.  The subject matter disclosed herein incorporates computing systems, media, methods, devices, and platforms to analyze the information that best matches with readers and viewers of content.  In addition, the subject system described
in this application utilizes mobile technologies and computing power to make information collection and sorting mobile, real-time, on-the-go, and ubiquitous.
<br/><br/> While the technology presented in the subject matter may be susceptible to embodiment in different forms, there are shown in the drawings and will be described herein in detail, specific embodiments with the understanding that the present
disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the principles of the invention, and is not intended to limit the invention to that as illustrated.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a flow chart which illustrates steps of a computerized method of collecting, sorting and presenting information and/or articles to a user, where the method is in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  FIG. 2 is a
diagram which illustrates a system or architecture which can be used to practice the method illustrated in FIG. 1.  As shown, the method provides that information, such as a plurality of information articles, is collected, such as by one or more
computers in a network, from one or more information sources.  As shown in FIG. 2, the information may be collected from, for example, RSS feeds, application program interfaces (API's) from publishers, and data from social media (such as Twitter,
<b><i>Facebook,</i></b> and/or Instagram, or other social media platform), as well as other or alternative sources.  Attributes (such as location, popularity, source, etc.) are assigned to the data by one or more computers, and the one or more computers store the data
and associated attributes in one or more databases.  Also stored in one or more databases, either in the same database(s) or in other databases as the collected information, is information about users.  An application is made available to users for use
on a mobile device or tablet (see FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B, which illustrates the graphic user interface).  Information articles are presented to the user via the application.  User interaction with the application is tracked to determine user preferences
with regard to the articles which are presented.  This user interaction which has been tracked is thereafter used to determine what information to present to that user in the future via the application, and/or what information should be presented to
other users, such as users in the same or similar location, or users in the same or similar demographic, etc., using the application.  Because information is prioritized before it is sent to the users, the users have more incentive to use the application
to obtain information (such as view news stories).
<br/><br/> With regard to the tracking of user interaction, as shown in FIG. 4, the application may be configured such that a user swipes one way (such as right) to indicate interest in the information being displayed (such as a news story), and swipes
another way (such as left) to indicate a lack of interest in the information being displayed (such as a news story).  Note that the directions (up, left, right, down) of the swipes can be easily adapted based on the need of system designs; for example,
an embodiment uses "up" to indicate like and "down" to indicate dislike.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the systems, methods, media, devices, and platforms described herein track the user swipes to provide that information, such as articles, news stories, video clips, and/or audio files, and the like, which are fed to users in
an efficient manner, in a manner based on time relevance, assumed interest with regard to that given user based on past actions by that user or information otherwise known about that user, as well as interest in the articles demonstrated by other users. 
Of course, the applications, methods, media, platforms, devices, and systems described herein can be configured such that some other action taken by the user is tracked instead of, or in addition to, swipes by the user.  Regardless, user interaction
regarding the application is tracked and used to effectively sort and prioritize the information in the database, such that user interaction with the application affects what information is delivered to that particular user, or even other users, in the
future.  Non-limiting examples of user interactions tracking include eyeballs tracking, face tracking, expression tracking, gestures tracking, and motion tracking In an embodiment, any motion or movement taking place by a portion or the whole of the
human body is used to track the reaction of the reader.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the user reaction is not binary (i.e., like or dislike), but in a scale.  For example, the user reaction ranges from 1 to 10 in certain applications.  For example, the user can click a meter between 1 and 10 to indicate the
degree of likeness.  The range of the scale can be adapted on the need of embodiments.  In some embodiments, a combination of binary and scaled (i.e., degree) of reactions is used.
<br/><br/> The methods, devices, media, platforms, and systems described herein are effectively configured to passively collect user data to display the most relevant results of a query.  Swiping (for example) through results on the interfaces of a
computing device (e.g., desktop computers, mobile and tablet devices) represents a low impact action on users that allows for a high level of data collection that can be used to filter and improve future query results automatically.  For example, for a
query on news, results based on passively collected data combined with the most recent stories results in a news feed which a given user will more likely find interesting, rather than just feeding a user random news stories.  For a general search query,
rating results by swiping left or right passively collects data on user feedback on each result which improves the search algorithm for future queries.  Swiping through results in different directions not only allows a user to quickly move through
results using the application, but also allows the publisher to gather information on what results are bad and which are satisfactory by forcing users to swipe in one direction or the other.  For example, swiping left would denote a poor experience,
while swiping right would denote a positive experience.  This passive, low impact data collection method is then preferably used in real time to sort future results in the graphic user interface (i.e., the mobile device or tablet running the
application).  Preferably, a constant feedback and results query loop is implemented to graphically order results that are more relevant or more satisfactory in general.  The system provides that overtime (i.e., news stories which are too old), bad
results notated by many users swiping left are weeded out of the results or at least seriously devalued.  Other results that get many swipes to the right are valued higher in the results.  Preferably, not only are results sorted per person (i.e., user)
individually, but global feedback is taken into account.  Preferably, the system provides that information articles/images/videos/audios (and the like) are graphed by initial personal data (i.e., information about the user, either actively supplied by
the user or other discerned about the user (such as location, etc.), while using passive interaction data to continually reorder the articles in real-time, while new stories are being injected into the stream, all while other stories are
increasing/decreasing in stature based on popularity and time decay.  Preferably, by the time a single piece of information is shown to the user (i.e., via the application), the information has effectively competed against other information based on
popularity, time relevance, what is known about the user based on, for example, initial signup interest data and how the user has responded to all the other articles with which the user has interacted (i.e., did the user swipe right or left?), as well as
what their friends (such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b> friends) and other local data have indicated vis-a-vis the system.  Preferably, the system uses technology to effectively touch on all the historical qualities of what makes a given piece of information relevant in
order to separate the best and most relevant information from what other users may think is relevant.  Preferably, the system effectively eliminates the guesswork of determining what not only an audience in interested in, but what a given user will find
interesting, based on how that user and other users have interacted with the application as they were being shown the information.  Preferably, the system constantly weighs, for example, the following attributes before determining which specific article
should be presented to a given user via the application: what a user's friends are reading (i.e., what articles have they swiped right to), locale, time, personal interests (i.e., personal readership interaction history), popularity graph and trending
status of article, time decay function, quality of content, integrity and bias of writer and publisher, etc.
<br/><br/> In certain applications, the methods, devices, platforms, media, and systems described herein re-order pieces of information (e.g., articles, images, videos, audios, and the like) in real-time.  For example, assuming a user is running the
application and requests a piece of information , the system method, device, or platform may have all the information articles/images/videos/audios in order and prioritized from, say, number 1 to 10,000.  Upon receiving a query from the user using the
application, information number one is depicted on the display (of the mobile device, desktop, or tablet) using the application.  Before the user even has a chance to view information number one, read the headline and decide if they are interested in
reading the article or not, the global environment has changed in that other users have effectively indicated an interest or a lack of interest in given information which was presented to them, or within seconds a new piece of information may have been
added to the numerous, for example10,000, pieces of information and that new information may contain more contents than a past information (including for example in the 10,000 on the same subject).
<br/><br/> For example, assume that Publisher A posts an article about an automobile accident and the article begins trending in the corresponding local area.  By the time that article may have been shown to a user via the application, a new article could
have been posted by Publisher B that reports not only that there was an accident, but that there were major injuries were involved.  Perhaps minutes later Publisher C posts an article providing the same information, but also providing the names of the
victims in the accident.  In this example, a social network (such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or Twitter) may have given a larger weight to the story from Publisher A because the first story and report has a tendency to be shared the most, despite the fact that the
story from Publisher A no longer contains the best information.  On the other hand, assume the article from Publisher C is weighed in (i.e., assessed against the other articles).  While it can be assumed that the article from Publisher C has the best
information because it contains the names of the victims, perhaps history (i.e., tracked information regarding user interaction) indicates that users do not like Publisher C because their information has been inaccurate.  In this case, the article from
Publisher C would be weighed down by the system.  Preferably, the system weighs quality and integrity of stories on the same topic against each other in order to determine the best information to present to users.  This is important given the increasing
amount of citizen journalism on social media, which results in inaccurate stories traveling quickly before or even while the correct information is being released or published.  Furthermore, in this example, perhaps a given user has always clicked out of
(i.e., swiped left after briefly viewing) an article about automobile accidents and tragedies because that given user has found such stories to be too negative or sad.  The system preferably takes that into account.  As such, the system may have
determined that none of the stories about the automobile accident should be presented to that given user.  On the other hand, despite the fact that a given user has indicated a lack of interest when it comes to stories about automobile accidents (i.e.,
by swiping left), the system may determine that an article about an accident should still be presented to the user because, for example, the user may be travelling through the area and the information may be relevant to the user's traffic route.  In this
case, the system would give the article priority with regard to that user, despite that user having indicated a lack of interest with regard to similar stories.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, one or more of the algorithms (e.g., re-ordering) are dynamic.  It utilizes statistics, probabilistic modeling, machine learning, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence analysis.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is an illustration which shows how the methods, devices, media, platforms, and systems described herein are used to effectively funnel information to a given user, and is self-explanatory.  The system, method, device, or platform collects
all the information (in any types of formats) from the world.  Features of information are analyzed first, e.g., location, time, and popularity.  To filter the information best match with a user, the system utilizes the user's personal data to identify
the best match.  The personal data includes the demographic data, and the historical passive feedback provided by the user.  In some embodiments, the personal data includes family information and friend information, which are provided in the personal
profiles or from one or more social media.  The analysis funnels the most preferred information.
<br/><br/> As discussed, feedback in news is often cumbersome and requires extra user input.  However, it can be extremely valuable given the sheer frequency and size of information being pointed at an individual nowadays through social networks and a
myriad of platforms.  A system which is in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention provides that information is presented and feedback is collected effectively simultaneously.  In turn, this real time feedback is used to determine what
information to present to users.
<br/><br/> For example, as shown in FIG. 4, the systems, methods, media, devices, and platforms described herein may be configured such that if an article is presented to a user (via the application), and the user swipes left (thereby indicating to the
system a lack of interest in the article), preferably the subject matter operates such that the article disappears for that particular user (via the application), and the system, method, device, or platform is configured such that articles with similar
attributes are de-valued for that particular user.  Additionally, preferably the system, method, device, or platform described herein provides that the more users that swipe left for a particular article, the more the article is devalued globally (i.e.,
with regard to other users).  Additionally, preferably the system, method, device, or platform provides that the more times a specific publisher or author's article is swiped left, the system, method, device, or platform responds by effectively devaluing
that specific publisher or author's articles.  Preferably, this devaluing occurs in real time and effectively deter lines or affects the rankings of the articles.
<br/><br/> On the other hand, if an article is presented to a user (via the application), and the user swipes right (thereby indicating to the system an interest in the article), preferably the system, method, device, or platform described herein operates
such that the article is added to a reading list for that user, and articles with similar attributes are valued higher for that particular user.  Additionally, preferably the system, method, device, or platform provides that the more users that swipe
right for a particular article, the more the article is valued globally (i.e., with regard to other users).  Additionally, preferably the system, method, device, or platform provides that the more times a specific publisher or author's article is swiped
right, the system, method, device, or platform responds by effectively valuing higher that specific publisher or author's articles.  Preferably, this increased valuing occurs in real time and effectively determines of affects the rankings of the
articles.
<br/><br/> Another embodiment of the present invention relates to content discovery searches.  In a content discovery search, an individual seeking information based on a query is presented with results.  The results are presented as a list of links.  The
results are not as relevant as they should be, given that conventional search programs do the following for the user: present a user with results based on some query or algorithm, the user clicks on a link to a third party web site, and the results are
rated based on antiquated quantifications such as estimated time spent on the website and estimated bounce rate of the users (in reality, these two are merely estimated because search engines do not have any direct access to the result itself).
<br/><br/> In a computerized method, device, platform, and system described herein which is in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, results of the query are displayed within a search user interface (such as on the screen of a mobile
device or tablet running the application previously discussed), allowing the search engine itself to, in its most basis embodiment, have full analytics over the quality of the result.  However, the more advanced provides that the user can effectively
offer active feedback by one click, swipe or arrow movement, for example.  As an example, as shown in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B, a user queries news stories about the Supreme Court.  Stories are shown in a list.  The user clicks the first result, which is an
article on CNN.com.  The CNN.com article is displayed within a frame or in application browser.  The user can then arrow left to indicate that the result was not worthy and move on to the next result, or arrow right to indicate that the result was worthy
and move on to the next result.  Regardless, active feedback is communicated back to the system which appends results globally and per user.  Preferably, the system provides that information and external site links are sorted in search results and on
feeds for users based on active feedback obtained by other users who have visited those external third party sites.  As such, this embodiment is much like the first described, except that instead of presenting the user with articles, having the user
indicate an interest in the article (by swiping right, for example) or a lack of interest in the article (by swiping left, for example), and adjusting the ranking of articles based on user feedback, this second embodiment (or add on to the first
embodiment) allows the user to query, provides the user with a list of links or articles that match the query, has the user select an item in the list of results and indicate an interest in the selected item (by swiping right, for example) or a lack of
interest in the item (by swiping left, for example), and adjusts the ranking of items based on user feedback, where the ranking at least helps determines what information is presented to users in the future.  FIG. 6 illustrates the steps of this
alternative method and is self-explanatory given the foregoing discussion.  Generally, both embodiments described herein provide that users are presented with information.  The users use a user interface to indicate an interest or lack of interest in the
different items of information.  The user indications are tracked and employed to determine what information is to be presented to that user and/or other users in the future.
<br/><br/> In the description above, the example was given of having the user swipe right (vis-a-vis the user interface) to indicate an interest in information, and having the user swipe left (vis-a-vis the user interface) to indicate a lack of interest in
information; however, alternative types of user feedback can be requested via the user interface.  Regardless, preferably the feedback which is received by the computerized system, method, device, or platform is used to determine which items to present
(and in what order to present the items) to one or more users in the future.
<br/><br/> While specific embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it is envisioned that those skilled in the art may devise various modifications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Data Analysis
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the analyses of collected information and personal data are based on statistics, machine learning, and/or artificial intelligence.  FIG. 13 presents a classifier for information sorting.  The system, method, device, or
platform collects information from the world, and converts the information into machine readable formats.  The formats are further verified.  In addition, the system, method, device, or platform processes the information contents to extract one or more
keywords.  For text information, the system, method, device, or platform is able to analyze the context and extract crucial keywords.  For non-text information, the system, method, device, or platform is able to process images, videos, audio to utilize
machine learning techniques to understand the contents, followed by keywords extractions.  In certain embodiments, the analysis includes removing variations of contents (e.g., words, images, voices, sounds) and reduces the contents to simplest form. 
Furthermore, the redundant information/contents (e.g., stop words, or transitioning images/sounds/voices) are removed.  In further embodiments, the contents are classified; for instance, one or more statistical algorithms are used to search contents to
recommend the defined categories/topics of the information.  Then, the system, method, device, or platform chooses top recommendations for categories/topics, which are assigned to the information articles/images/videos/audios.  Finally, additional
information data is then processed and added to the data model.
<br/><br/> Another embodiment is presented in FIG. 14, where the human knowledge and machine learning are integrated for information sorting.  The system, method, device, or system collects all types of information from the world and stores the information
in a local storage.  The statistical counts and metrics are used to inform choices for defined category list.  Then, samples of independently classified content for each defined category are chosen.  In a further embodiment, the system, method, device,
or platform converts the collected information into machine readable formats and verifies the formats.  For example, the system, method, device, and/or platform described herein processes the information contents to extract one or more keywords.  For
text information, the system, method, device, and platform is able to analyze the context and extract crucial keywords.  For non-text information, the system, method, device, or platform processes images, videos, audio, or other data files to utilize
machine learning techniques to understand the contents, followed by keywords extractions.  In certain embodiments, the analysis includes removing variations of contents (e.g., words, images, voices, sounds) and reduces the contents to simplest form. 
Furthermore, the redundant information/contents (e.g., stop words, or transitioning images/sounds/voices) are removed.  Additionally, the technology described herein trains a recognition module to recognize similar contents as the independently
classified category.  The knowledge is then stored for use as part of the content (text, images, videos, audios) classification step.

<br/><br/>Example 1
<br/><br/>Graphic User Interface
<br/><br/> FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B illustrates an example of the graphic user in an embodiment.  Referring to FIG. 7(a), component 701 comprised a function of search.  The user could use this to search publishers, people, or any particularities.  Component 702
was the place to display sorted information; in this example, the system was performing sorting, so an image of "shuffling" was displayed.  Components 703 and 704 were buttons for the user to provide feedback, where 703 indicated a dislike and 704
indicated a like.  Components 705, 706, 707, and 708 were particular categories (interests, popular, nearby, and following, respectively) to narrow the search.
<br/><br/> Component 709 allowed a display of the user's picture.  Component 710 recorded the amount of liked information the user had indicated.  Component 711 was a button where the user could clickto share the current information with friends via social
media (<b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, email).
<br/><br/> During the shuffling, the system utilized a learning algorithm to explore the best match between information and the user's interest.  The exploration was based on machine learning algorithms.  The device that was installed with the learning
technology described herein became a special purpose computing device dedicated to information learning device.  First, the contents of information were analyzed to identify representative features.  The features were modeled as random variables.  A
classifier based on probabilistic modeling was used classify the category (or categories) the information should belong to.  On the other hand, the user data (e.g., demographics, locations, interests, etc) was also modeled probabilistically.  The match
between the content features and the user was based on various machine learning algorithms.  The user's feedback was treated as prior human knowledge, which was used to predict the most relevant categories to the user.  The prediction was based on
statistical analyses, such as Bayesian statistics and regression analysis.  The information within the categories was further distilled by the statistical analyses to identify the best information articles/images/videos/audios for the user.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 7B, once a sorting was completed, the display region 712 presented a snapshot of an information to the user.  The user could click on the display region to access the detailed information.  Later on, the user could provide a
feedback to indicate like or dislike.
<br/><br/>Example 2
<br/><br/>Information Video
<br/><br/> FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B illustrates an example of an embodiment where the user liked an information video.  The system analyzed the profile information of the user and identified information which was of the user's interest with high probability. 
In this example, an interview video with Forbes CMO was presented to the user, shown as 803 in FIG. 8A.  When the user would like to move on to the next information message, the system required the user to provide a binary indication which either liked
or disliked the information.  The user could click the "check" or "cross" button in order to express "like" or "dislike," respectively.  Alternatively, the user could swipe the information to the right or to the left, in order to express "like" or
"dislike," respectively.  In FIG. 8B, the user swiped the information 804 to the right, corresponding to an indication of liking the information.  Referring FIG. 8B, when the user was wiping the information video, the next information message 805 which
was a news titled "Fans Get Too Turnt When Gareth Bale Scores Winner, Start Wrecking shit" was popping up.
<br/><br/> Once the user liked the information 804, the number of liked information changed from 6 (shown in component 801) to 7 (shown in component 802).
<br/><br/>Example 3
<br/><br/>Information Article
<br/><br/> FIG. 9A and FIG. 9B illustrates an example of an embodiment where the user disliked an information article.  The system analyzed the profile information and the past like/dislike history of the user to sort an information message of interest. 
In this example, an article "Happy 350.sup.th Birthday, New York!" published by USA Today with was presented to the user, shown in FIG. 9A.  When the user would like to move on to the next information message, the system required the user to provide a
binary indication which either liked or disliked the information.  In this example shown in FIG. 9B, the user wiped the information to the left, an indication of disliking the information article.  Furthermore, referring FIG. 9B, when the user was wiping
the information article, the system was searching the best information match with the user's interests.
<br/><br/>Example 4
<br/><br/>Narrow Information Sorting Using Categories
<br/><br/> FIGS. 10A-C illustrate an example of an embodiment using category "interest" to further sort the information.  As illustrated in FIG. 7, there were various categories (components 705 to 708) which can enhance the sorting accuracy.  Referring to
FIG. 10A, the category "interests" (1001) was not enabled.  After the user clicked the icon, the icon became highlighted as 1002 in FIG. 10B, and then the system generated a shuffling icon 1003 to indicate the system was undergoing sorting.  Once the
sorting completed, see FIG. 10C, the system presented the best information; in this case, an article from Forbes was identified.
<br/><br/> The categories were modeled probabilistically.  A category was treated as a random variable.  A classifier based on learning algorithms was used to classify information contents into categories.  When the user narrowed the information sorting
within certain categories, the device described herein further analyzed statistically the information contents within the categories of the user's interest.  Furthermore, the learning algorithms mapped the information features to the user's data, or vice
versa, to find the information aligning best with the user.
<br/><br/>Example 5
<br/><br/>Search Publishers
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 illustrates an example of an embodiment using the search function to find publishers of interest.  Referring to FIG. 11A, component 1101 allowed the user to enable the search function, which changed the user interface, shown in FIG. 11B. In FIG. 11B, a text box 1102 was displayed to enable the user to type the keywords of the search.  In FIG. 11C, the user attempted to find New York Times; he typed "new y" and the system immediately identified The New York Times 1104 as a most likely
candidate.  The user then clicked the icon of The New York Times, moving to another screen shown in FIG. 11D, where a list of articles relevant to the user's interest was presented.  When the user click one item, the full access to the article "For
RadioShack, a History of Misses" was displayed, as shown in FIG. 11E.
<br/><br/>Example 6
<br/><br/>Share Information
<br/><br/> FIG. 12A and FIG. 12B illustrates an example of an embodiment using the share function to share the information on social media.  Referring to FIG. 12A, the system presented an article "Under Armour missed out on Kevin Durant, but signed Gisele"
to the user.  The user loved this article and he was eager to share this article with his friends.  When clicking the button 1201, the system moved to another screen FIG. 12B where the user could choose which social media (<b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, email)
and/or which friends to share the article.
