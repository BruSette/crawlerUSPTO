       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> Systems and methods presenting digital images utilizing an infinite
     cylinder user interface that includes a plurality of modes of movement to
     variously display the digital images in an efficient and convenient
     manner. An image viewing system utilizing an infinite cylinder user
     interface includes a data store storing a plurality of images in a local
     visual dictionary, each of the plurality of images configured to convey a
     message to at least one additional user as a replacement for words; a
     network interface communicatively coupled to a network; a processor
     communicatively coupled to the data store and the network interface; and
     instructions executable by the processor, and in response to such
     execution causes the processor to: present a set of the plurality of
     images in an infinite cylinder user interface; and manipulate the
     infinite cylinder user interface in a plurality of movement modes based
     on user input.

<br/><br/> The present disclosure relates generally to electronic communications.  More particularly, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods presenting digital images utilizing an infinite cylinder user interface.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The ability for individuals and groups to communicate and carry on a conversation has been dramatically transformed by personal computing/memory devices, easy to use software, the Internet, wireless communications, and the like.  For example,
consumer communications have evolved over the past twenty years from almost solely using land-based home phone lines for oral communications and discussions to mobile phone devices which enable both oral communications and the use of written words as
messages in the form of text messages, electronic mail, video chat, etc. In this interconnected Internet world, oral communication is taking a back seat to software that manipulates words enabling text and email messaging.  In this new abbreviated-text,
quick-phrase Internet world, meaning can be lost, or the electronic message can be easily misinterpreted.
<br/><br/> Since the evolution of written communications, natural language words have dominated communication and dialogue, while descriptive pictures have been used to provide ad hoc insertions to words and stories.  Even in the current electronic digital
age of the Internet, natural language words dominate dialogue, as witnessed by the almost universal use of email and the more recent explosion of text messaging on computers and cell phones.
<br/><br/> The continued investment in (1) advanced computer processor and memory technology with the vast manipulation capabilities they provide, and (2) the electronic communication networks that carry the message from one computer, personal digital
assistant (PDA), cell phone, smart phone, tablet, or other electronic device to another computer, PDA, cell phone, smart phone, tablet, or other electronic device is the modern day equivalent to investment in the word printing press.  More and more
efficient natural language word communication is happening at electron speed to instantly connect one user to another user almost anywhere in the world.  Yet, the understandable meaning being conveyed may be confused, as words do not always carry enough
information for full meaning.  For example, when a user texts "Bring home an apple for me," it is not all that clear what type of apple that the user wants: red/green, small/large, juicy/dry, sweet/sour, etc, so the apple that the user gets may not be
the one that the user wanted.
<br/><br/> Current word based communication systems operate on a built in conversation control principle of "I talk, you listen, then respond", where a leader starts the conversation (because in speaking only one can talk and everyone else listens) and
waits for a response from the listener or audience, and the leader receives feedback and responds, thus continuing the cycle of "I talk, you listen" on and on (or called "post and wait" method in word emails, chats or blogs).  Computer email and text
messaging systems mimic this approach as they developed from a vocal speech paradigm and imitated how we speak in real life.  So, email and text messaging communication systems tend to list initiator-then responses-then initiator response--and so on. 
Further, once a word sentence is constructed and used (stated), there is little need to save the word sentence and reuse it in another word sentence or word paragraph as is, so the word sentences are used in the one flow they were first, and only
designed for.  The conversation control paradigm of "I talk, you listen" does not apply to conversations using images sequenced together to send message(s) amongst many (tens to millions) participants simultaneously in real time.  Each participant uses
their own images and image sentences to communicate at any time in the conversation.  New, flexible communication rules (styles) are required to manage the new visual talking not bounded by the conventional paradigm of "I talk, you listen" control.  It
is desirable to provide a system and method that allows for the selection of a communication style for visual sentences from a palette of styles, for the sequencing of these styles in a desired conversation flow in a community, and for the selection of
members in the community, and for the members to participate in the discussions using the various styles.
<br/><br/> With respect to content distribution, conventional content distribution systems and methods require selecting on line content (e.g., television, movies, music, videos, etc.) in a tedious manner where individual pieces of content are seen one at
a time (as opposed to all in relation to each other) or some limited set to view, with no interaction (i.e., ability to select, edit and redirect, etc.) and only a limited way to view (with limited action).  Further, users can create activities and
license associated content only for short times, because online communities are like "soaps bubbles", where they rise up and grow, and then pop and disappear, so the selection system must be bigger and more lasting than soap bubbles.
<br/><br/> With respect to viewing, displaying, and managing content, i.e. digital images, as visual communicators grow, more efficient systems and methods are needed for viewing, selecting, adding, editing, and reading visual images.  Conventional user
interfaces include flat spaces in all directions that are too slow, cumbersome, difficult to manage, etc. Such conventional user interfaces are typically constrained to a two dimensional view with modes of movement in the x-y plane only, i.e. scrolling
up and down or sideways.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> In an exemplary embodiment, an image viewing system utilizing an infinite cylinder user interface includes a data store storing a plurality of images in a local visual dictionary, each of the plurality of images configured to convey a message to
at least one additional user as a replacement for words; a network interface communicatively coupled to a network; a processor communicatively coupled to the data store and the network interface; and instructions executable by the processor, and in
response to such execution causes the processor to: present a set of the plurality of images in an infinite cylinder user interface; and manipulate the infinite cylinder user interface in a plurality of movement modes based on user input.  In another
exemplary embodiment, an image viewing portal providing an infinite cylinder user interface includes a network interface communicatively coupled to at least one user via a network; a data store storing a plurality of images in a local visual dictionary
for each of the at least one user, each of the plurality of images configured to convey a message to at least one additional user as a replacement for words; a processor communicatively coupled to the data store and the network interface; and
instructions executable by the processor, and in response to such execution causes the processor to: present a set of the plurality of images in an infinite cylinder user interface to the at least one user over the network; and manipulate the infinite
cylinder user interface in a plurality of movement modes based on user input from the at least one user.  In yet another exemplary embodiment, an image viewing method includes presenting a plurality of images in a cylindrical format on a user interface,
each of the plurality of images configured to convey a message to at least one additional user as a replacement for words; moving the cylindrical format on the user interface longitudinally about an x-axis of the user interface based on user input;
rotating the cylindrical format on the user interface about the x-axis; and drilling down to a cylinder within a cylinder. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> Given the rapid increase in memory capacity of computers, mobile devices, and networks, current image/picture practice focuses entirely on manipulating images for the passive purpose of image presentation and broadcasting, and has not been used
heretofore for structuring a continuing communication dialogue, with connections to a responding community of people or a lasting relevant image and word dictionary.  Current software programs having varying levels of ability to name images, search
images, manipulate images as for adding to and changing the image, and rank images.  Certain Internet web sites allow for the collection of images produced from various sources (e.g., digital cameras) for the purposes of storage and simple display or
even printing.  As with the printing press, these image storage systems are similar to individual letters in the printing press drawer waiting to be assembled into a template for distribution to the community.  And once distributed to the community, the
community can respond in kind and carry the discussion forward, saving any components of the discussion they may like, in any form, such as a paragraph, a book, workflow, a manual, or any manner of conversation.
<br/><br/> The current natural language word system of dialogue could be enhanced to deliver clearer meaning by a system and method that adds pictures or primarily uses pictures as a fundamental component to the sentence dialogue structure (and other
structure templates that can be used to communicate), e.g., inserting the picture of a green, small, granny smith apple enhances the apple text message and better ensures that the user gets the right apple.  Therefore, it is desirable to build a
communication system and method that uses pictures as the primary mode of dialogue (and words for enhancement).
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a system and method for electronic communications dialogue between and among a plurality of users.  Embodiments include building image dictionaries defined by words, sequencing the images and
associated words into certain communication templates, and publishing the templates to select individuals and communities or groups for response and discussion.  To initiate a conversation, a user first selects a preferred communication template and
inserts sample words, then sample images are selected from a visual dictionary and inserted into the appropriate location in the template until the template is completed.  Alternatively, the images can be selected without sample words.  The user selects
the method of sending the template, identifies the recipients, and presses send on a user interface.  The user may perform this functionality through a web portal, an application operating on a mobile device or the like, etc. As described herein, a
portal may include one or more servers, the "cloud", a wireless provider, or the like.  Specifically, portal may refer to any device communicatively coupled to a network such as the Internet that is configured to provide the functionality described
herein.
<br/><br/> In an exemplary embodiment, a visual dictionary is created for each user using a facility which takes images from any electronic source (e.g., photos such as from a mobile device, websites, drawings, etc.), makes an image therefrom, and allows
users to apply naming tags to store the image for later retrieval.  A visual library is created for each user to save completed and partially completed templates (e.g., visual sentences, paragraphs, etc.) to retrieve them for further editing or use.  In
one exemplary embodiment, the visual dictionary is stored at the portal.  In another exemplary embodiment, the visual dictionary is contained in memory, data storage, etc. associated with a mobile device.  Here, the visual dictionary may synchronize or
update through the web portal.
<br/><br/> The Overall Integrated System
<br/><br/> FIG. 1A illustrates an overview of exemplary processing logic to create, save, and send sentences and templates.  This exemplary processing logic shows the major activities of sentence/template creation, saving, and sending.  Embodiments are
directed to a portal system that allows the user to enter the web portal (block 10) and view an example "sentence of the day" (block 20).  If the user wants to create his own dialogue, he can log in, and have a number of options to participate in a
dialogue (block 40).  In a first option, the user could create a new sentence or a new template (block 42).  In a second option, the user could respond to a message sent to him from another user (block 44).  In a third option, the user could go to his
saved templates library (block 46), and select an item to edit.  In each case, the user selects a message into which images are added according to the template.  To input images, the user either extracts images from sources external to the portal or
searches for images in the user's stored visual dictionary.  Once an image is selected (block 58), the user can store the image in a "visual dictionary" (block 62) by assigning a word or words to the image, and by assigning a unique random number and
other tags that the user defines.  Once the user saves the image in a personal visual dictionary (block 62), the user then inserts the image into the template (block 64).  The user repeats this image insertion method (blocks 56-64) until the template has
been completed, and then moves to save the template in the user's library (blocks 68, 70) or goes directly to send the message (block 76).  If the user decides to save the message (block 66), the user defines how to save it in his library (block 70), and
can decide to save it as private or public for other users to see (block 72).  After saving the message (block 74), the user has the option to send it to someone, or to return to the home portal to insert it into a bigger template, via the send option. 
Using the send option (block 76), the user can decide to submit the message to the "sentence of the day" (block 78).  The user then sends the message to selected individuals and/or groups in the portal (blocks 80, 82), and can send an alert to others
outside the portal via electronic means like email.  After sending the message (block 76), the user returns to the home portal and can repeat the process (block 90).  In an exemplary embodiment, the alert may also be a full visual message, such as with
using an app on a mobile device.
<br/><br/> The web portal for electronic communications dialog between a plurality of users using digital images can be accessed via any computing device having a networking capability including, but not limited to, mainframe computers, portable computers,
workstations, personal digital assistants, cell phones, and other mobile computing devices.  Furthermore, the web portal may be realized in a server, such as depicted in FIG. 10.  Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the present
disclosure may also be implemented as an application on a device, e.g. mobile phone, smart phone, computer, etc. Here, the web portal functionality described herein may be performed locally at the device via the application.  The web portal functionality
may be further implemented in a cloud-based architecture across various servers.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1B illustrates an overview of the flow between major user interface displays.  The various templates including sentences, paragraphs, books, etc. that are used in exemplary embodiments of the disclosure are described more fully below.  User
interface 100 enables the new user to view pictorial sentences in section 110 as examples to familiarize the new user with preparing pictorial sentences, or other templates, from scratch, and allows the experienced user ("visual talker") to access any
template (200) from section 120, or to respond to recently received dialogue via respond user interface (600).  If the user wants to create a new simple sentence of six words or less, the user can use the simple "design your sentence" template (120).  To
input pictures into the simple "design your sentence" template, the user selects a picture via insert pictures user interface (300) from an external source or from the user's own visual dictionary and then submits the picture to be inserted into the
sentence (120).  Each picture submitted to template (120) has the option to add descriptive words such that when all the words are combined, they create a simple sentence (or another template).  Once the simple sentence is fully completed with pictures
and words, the user can save the work via save user interface (400).  After saving the work in a visual library using save user interface (400), the user can send the work to be communicated to another user by selecting various sending methods and user
types available via send user interface (500).
<br/><br/> Similar to a new simple sentence described above, a user can create any pictorial communication using any number of templates available in expanded templates (200).
<br/><br/> The user can select either to use a respond user interface (600) sending the user to view and highlight messages to respond to, or to view more templates and select which template to use.  Once the template is selected, the user inserts pictures
via insert pictures user interface (300), saves the completed template via save user interface (400), and sends the template using send user interface (500) similar to the method for a simple sentence.
<br/><br/> Accessing the System
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 2, the home portal page (100) can be found by the user by typing in the URL of the service provider's website.  Once at the home page, the user can view the entire page including sections 110 and 120.  Without logging in,
the user can view all the examples simply by accessing the list of examples in "View More" (101).  A user may login, by pressing the login button (102).  If the user presses any other button (121-126, 140, 150, 160, or 170), the user will be prompted
automatically to login.  Once login occurs, the user has access to all buttons on the user interface 100.
<br/><br/> Selecting a New Template
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 1, after a user logs in, the user can select only one working template: (1) as a simple sentence (120), (2) as a larger template by pressing "View More" (170), or (3) as a "Respond" (160) using specific response user
interface (600).  Once the user selects the template, the home page (100) converts to the appropriate user interface, and the user can begin to insert pictures (300) in the appropriate locations.  If the user selects "View More" (170), the user will be
presented with the user interface illustrated in FIG. 3.  With reference to FIG. 3, the user can select a longer sentence (210), a personal (social) template (220, 230, 240, 250), or a business template (260, 270, 280, 290).
<br/><br/> Inserting Pictures and Words into a Template
<br/><br/> Words are added into a template simply by typing into the word box (131-136).  Pictures are added by clicking on the appropriate visual box (121-126, depending on the template chosen) and being transported to the "insert pictures" portal (300)
that is illustrated in FIG. 5.  Within the insert pictures portal (300), the user can input a new picture into the work area (350) by one of two main methods: by linking (310) to an external site and selecting a picture for insertion, or by "searching
terms" (380) in the visual dictionary and selecting a picture for insertion.  Once the picture is inserted in the work area (350), the user can enter descriptive data into the appropriate data locations (320).  Entering descriptive data into the data
locations and saving this for later search creates a personal visual dictionary for the user.  As with a word dictionary and a word associated with definitions, this visual dictionary has images and can be searched by a simple word from a word dictionary
or can be searched by the other defined data tags (320).  Once the user feels he has the right picture and all the data entered to index the picture in a visual dictionary, the user selects the "insert" button (330).  This causes the picture to be
inserted into the appropriate location in the template (121-126), and simultaneously into the visual dictionary with descriptive data.
<br/><br/> Saving the Template
<br/><br/> Prior to sending (150) a completed template (120), a user can save the template by pressing the save button (140).  The user then enters the save portal user interface (400) as illustrated in FIG. 6.  The user inputs data into the appropriate
fields creating a visual library record (410).  Then, the user must decide to save the record as a public (421) or as a private (422) record.  Finally, the user "saves" (430) the completed template in the library and is immediately returned to the home
portal (100).  At any time while in the save portal, the user may search (450) all previously saved entries in the library, and when completed, return to the save portal with no changes from when the user left the save portal.
<br/><br/> Sending the Completed Template
<br/><br/> With the template complete and saved (140), the user sends (150) the completed template using the send portal (500).  FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary send portal.  If the template is a sentence template, the user can select "Public Submit" (510)
to be considered for "sentence of the day" and be published on the home portal (100) for viewing by other users.  The user must choose who can review the message after login to the portal (520).  The user can select individuals (521) or groups (522).  If
the user wants to send an external alert outside of the portal to the intended recipient (530), the user selects the appropriate alert system (531, 532).  After the user selects the send button (590), the user is returned to the original home portal
(100) automatically.  Note, FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary send portal that may be used over a network.  Alternatively, FIG. 7 may be modifier to provide a send user interface on a mobile device with similar functions.
<br/><br/> Responding to a Message
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 2, the user knows that there is a message awaiting the user's response by seeing the "Respond" button (160) highlighted.  When the user selects the respond button (160), the user is presented with the user interface (600)
depicted in FIG. 4.  The user can view (610) all messages awaiting response by selecting "View More" (602) and scrolling through a list of templates (i.e., sentences, etc).  This scrolling mechanism operates similar to viewing the "sentence of the day"
(110) as depicted in FIG. 2, and then scrolling through the sentences after pressing "View More" (101).  In the user interface of FIG. 4, in order to select a message to respond to, the user clicks on "Select One" (601), and that selection is then
inserted into the "design your sentence" template (620).
<br/><br/> The "design/save/send" actions necessary to finish the design of the respond sentence are similar to the actions described above for: (1) inserting pictures and words into a template, (2) saving the template, and (3) sending the completed
template.  For the first action, the user selects "Visuals" (621-626) in the user interface 600 of FIG. 4, and is presented with user interface 300 of FIG. 5 to insert images.  For the second action, the user selects "Save" (640) and is presented with
user interface 400 of FIG. 6 to save the template.  For the third action, the user selects "Send" (650) and is presented with user interface 500 of FIG. 7 to send the message.  The user can press "Home" (670) and return to FIG. 2 at any time.
<br/><br/> Edit Library of Saved Templates
<br/><br/> As illustrated in the user interface 700 of FIG. 8, a user may want to: (1) add to and complete a previously saved sentence (720), (2) add/insert a previously saved sentence into a larger template (760), or (3) send a previously completed
sentence (750).  Similar to responding to a message, as illustrated in FIG. 4, the user selects (701) a saved sentence from a list (702) and edits the saved sentence in "Design your template" (720).  Once the user completes the template (720), the user
has three options: (1) to save (740), (2) to send (750), or (3) to insert into a larger template (760).  Selecting save (740), the user is presented with the user interface of FIG. 6.  Selecting send (750), the user is presented with the user interface
of FIG. 7.  Selecting insert/template (760), the user is presented with the user interface of FIG. 3.
<br/><br/>Example
<br/><br/>Sentence Message
<br/><br/> In creating a simple message "I love you" to send to the user's spouse, the user selects the simple sentence template (120) in the home portal (100) illustrated in FIG. 2.  The user types "I" in the first word box (131), "love" in the second
word box (132), and "you" in the third word box (133).  Above the word "I" the user clicks (121) to go to the "insert pictures" portal (300) of FIG. 5, and selects a picture (310) from an external site where the user stored a self-image digital picture
from that day.  The user inserts that picture (350) and the associated data and tags (320), and selects the insert button (330) to put the image (121) above the "I" in the template 120.  Next, the process is repeated for selecting the image (122) above
the word "love," which happens to come from the visual dictionary on a search.  The template is completed by adding a picture (123) of the intended recipient ("you") from a digital photo scanned into the "insert pictures" portal (300).  With the template
completed, the user selects save (140) and in the library (400) user interface of FIG. 6, adds the data (410), private (422), and saves (430).  As a final step, the user presses send (150) on the user interface of FIG. 2, selects the individual (521) on
the user interface of FIG. 7, and hits send (590).  The message is sent to the recipient.  The person to whom this message is sent has a respond button (160) flashing and responds to the message using a similar process.
<br/><br/>Example
<br/><br/>Very Simple Dialogue to Make a Choice while Shopping
<br/><br/> As another example, consider a female shopper in the dressing room of a major retailer trying to match a potential new pair of shoes with the best dress from several different dress styles.  While in the dressing room, the shopper tries on each
dress with the pair of shoes and takes a digital picture of herself on her cell phone and stores each image.  After taking all the needed dress pictures, the shopper logs into the portal (100) and enters the design a sentence template (120).  The shopper
types "Which dress?" into the first word box and then above this word box the shopper clicks (121) to go to the "insert pictures" portal (300).  From her saved digital pictures (310), the shopper individually adds each picture taken to the insert visuals
(350), and without saving these temporary pictures in the visual dictionary (320), the shopper inserts (330) the pictures into the sentence (121) in one box, and skipping save (140), selects send (150) to send the message to her friend.  The person to
whom this message is sent responds (160) using a similar process, selects the best dress and sends the response to the shopper.  The shopper then leaves the dressing room and buys the selected dress.
<br/><br/>Example
<br/><br/>Paragraph Message Leading to a Book Template
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 9, one method to make a paragraph is to create individual sentences (120 or 210), save them individually in the library (410), and add the sentences individually to the paragraph template (220) by using the save library
insert template (720) and the select one (701) sentence from viewing the saved sentences (710).  For example, consider a user that wants to send the following message to a group of friends: "I went for a walk in the woods.  The trees were in full bloom. 
I saw birds romancing and I heard their songs.  I turned over a rock and saw all kinds of critters .  . . " During the walk, the user took many digital photos of the woods, the trees, the blooms, birds, critters, etc. For each sentence, the user builds
the sentence using the design your sentence template (120) as described in the simple example above, and saves each sentence in the library (410), but does not send the sentences saved.  Once all sentences are completed and saved, using the interface of
FIG. 8, the user edits the save library (720), selects insert template (760) to select a paragraph (220), clicks "select one" (701) to choose a previously saved sentence, and inserts the sentence into the paragraph template.  Once the paragraph is
complete the user saves (400) the paragraph and sends the paragraph (500) to a group (522) of friends.
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 9, the user can create a book, story, or longer template by saving individual paragraphs (220) and then combining the paragraphs together in a book template (250).  Combining paragraphs can include editing and manipulation
of a plurality of saved sentence templates.  The book building process is similar to the paragraph building process described above.
<br/><br/>Example
<br/><br/>How to Manual at Work
<br/><br/> With reference again to FIG. 9, a how to instruction manual at work can be built easily by creating simple sentence (210) instructions and then adding each sentence instruction in a sequenced list to the manual template which is similar to a
book template.
<br/><br/>Example
<br/><br/>Maintenance Worker Asking for Best Way to Fix Trouble at Remote Site
<br/><br/> Similar to the shopper example above, consider a maintenance worker who could be at a local site to repair a machine, but needs expert advice from the central office.
<br/><br/> Similar to the shopper example, the maintenance worker takes pictures of the machine in action and uses these pictures in sentences sent to the expert, for the expert to select the best way forward.  The maintenance worker performs the work
recommended by the remote expert and records this success in a workflow (280) template.  Furthermore, the maintenance worker can go to the save library (700) and view the pictorial operating manual (290) for the machine.
<br/><br/> Web Portal
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 10, in an exemplary embodiment, a block diagram illustrates a server 1200 which may be utilized in an exemplary implementation of the web portal 10.  The web portal 10 may be formed through one or more servers 1200.  The server
1200 may be a digital computer that, in terms of hardware architecture, generally includes a processor 1202, input/output (I/O) interfaces 1204, a network interface 1206, a data store 1208, and a memory 1210.  It should be appreciated by those of
ordinary skill in the art that FIG. 10 depicts the server 1200 in an oversimplified manner, and a practical embodiment may include additional components and suitably configured processing logic to support known or conventional operating features that are
not described in detail herein.  The components (1202, 1204, 1206, 1208, and 1210) are communicatively coupled via a local interface 1212.  The local interface 1212 may be, for example but not limited to, one or more buses or other wired or wireless
connections, as is known in the art.  The local interface 1212 may have additional elements, which are omitted for simplicity, such as controllers, buffers (caches), drivers, repeaters, and receivers, among many others, to enable communications. 
Further, the local interface 1212 may include address, control, and/or data connections to enable appropriate communications among the aforementioned components.
<br/><br/> The processor 1202 is a hardware device for executing software instructions.  The processor 1202 may be any custom made or commercially available processor, a central processing unit (CPU), an auxiliary processor among several processors
associated with the server 1200, a semiconductor-based microprocessor (in the form of a microchip or chip set), or generally any device for executing software instructions.  When the server 1200 is in operation, the processor 1202 is configured to
execute software stored within the memory 1210, to communicate data to and from the memory 1210, and to generally control operations of the server 1200 pursuant to the software instructions.  The I/O interfaces 1204 may be used to receive user input from
and/or for providing system output to one or more devices or components.  User input may be provided via, for example, a keyboard, touch pad, and/or a mouse.  System output may be provided via a display device and a printer (not shown).  I/O interfaces
1204 can include, for example, a serial port, a parallel port, a small computer system interface (SCSI), an infrared (IR) interface, a radio frequency (RF) interface, and/or a universal serial bus (USB) interface.
<br/><br/> The network interface 1206 may be used to enable the server 1200 to communicate on a network, such as the Internet and the like, etc. For example, the server 1200 can utilize the network interface 1206 to communicate to/from a plurality of users
of the web portal 10, etc. The network interface 1206 may include, for example, an Ethernet card or adapter (e.g., 10BaseT, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet) or a wireless local area network (WLAN) card or adapter (e.g., 802.11a/b/g/n).  The network
interface 1206 may include address, control, and/or data connections to enable appropriate communications on the network.  A data store 1208 may be used to store data.  The data store 1208 may include any of volatile memory elements (e.g., random access
memory (RAM, such as DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, and the like)), nonvolatile memory elements (e.g., ROM, hard drive, tape, CDROM, and the like), and combinations thereof.  Moreover, the data store 1208 may incorporate electronic, magnetic, optical, and/or other
types of storage media.  In one example, the data store 1208 may be located internal to the server 1200 such as, for example, an internal hard drive connected to the local interface 1212 in the server 1200.  Additionally in another embodiment, the data
store 1208 may be located external to the server 1200 such as, for example, an external hard drive connected to the I/O interfaces 1204 (e.g., SCSI or USB connection).  In a further embodiment, the data store 1208 may be connected to the server 1200
through a network, such as, for example, a network attached file server.
<br/><br/> The memory 1210 may include any of volatile memory elements (e.g., random access memory (RAM, such as DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, etc.)), nonvolatile memory elements (e.g., ROM, hard drive, tape, CDROM, etc.), and combinations thereof.  Moreover, the
memory 1210 may incorporate electronic, magnetic, optical, and/or other types of storage media.  Note that the memory 1210 may have a distributed architecture, where various components are situated remotely from one another, but can be accessed by the
processor 1202.  The software in memory 1210 may include one or more software programs, each of which includes an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions.  The software in the memory 1210 includes a suitable
operating system (O/S) 1214 and one or more programs 1216.  The operating system 1214 essentially controls the execution of other computer programs, such as the one or more programs 1206, and provides scheduling, input-output control, file and data
management, memory management, and communication control and related services.  The operating system 1214 may be any of Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003/2008 (all available from Microsoft, Corp.  of
Redmond, Wash.), Solaris (available from Sun Microsystems, Inc.  of Palo Alto, Calif.), LINUX (or another UNIX variant) (available from Red Hat of Raleigh, N.C.), or the like.  The one or more programs 1216 may be configured to implement the various
processes, algorithms, methods, techniques, etc. described herein with respect to the web portal 10 and the like.
<br/><br/> Mobile Device
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 11, in an exemplary embodiment, the present disclosure may include a mobile device 1300 with various components configured for providing mobile communications using sequenced images.  The mobile device 1300 may be a cell phone,

<br/><br/> Exemplary System Configurations
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 12, in exemplary embodiments, various diagrams illustrate exemplary operational scenarios providing mobile communications using sequenced images.  As described herein, the systems and methods of the present disclosure enable
communications between users using sequenced images.  FIG. 12 illustrates two exemplary operational scenarios including a web portal-based scenario 1400 and an application-based scenario 1402.  Each of these exemplary scenarios 1400, 1402 may be utilized
to perform the systems and methods described herein.
<br/><br/> In an exemplary embodiment, the web portal-based scenario 1400 includes a web portal 1410 connected to a plurality of users 1412 via a network 1414, such as the Internet.  Here, the plurality of users 1412 may include laptop computers, desktop
computers, tablets, mobile devices, and the like connected to the network 1414, e.g. through wired connections (cable modem, digital subscriber loop (DSL), dial-up, Ethernet, etc.) or wireless connections (3G/4G cellular, WLAN, WIMAX, etc.).  One of the
users 1412 may access the web portal 1410, such as described in FIG. 1A, and create a message of sequenced images via the web portal 1410.  Once created, the message may be sent via the web portal 1410 to another of the users 1412.  For example, the
message may be sent through any form known in the art, including, but not limited to, emails, web link, picture message via Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), text message via Short Message Service (SMS), tweet via Twitter.RTM., instant message,
Facebook.RTM.  update, and the like.  Of note, in the web portal-based scenario 1400, the message is created on the web portal 1410 using a UI and associated dictionaries connected to the web portal 1410.  That is, the users 1412 may implement any of the
methods, processes, mechanisms, etc. described herein in FIGS. 1-9 via the web portal 1410.
<br/><br/> In another exemplary embodiment, the application-based scenario 1402 includes a first user 1420 communicatively coupled to a second user 1422 via a network 1424.  In one exemplary embodiment, the first user 1420 may include a mobile device such
as the mobile device 1300 and the network 1424 may include a wireless network (e.g. 3G/4G cellular, WLAN, WIMAX, etc.).  Here, the mobile device 1300 includes an application in the programs 1328 that may be referred to as a visual dictionary application. The application is configured to provide similar functionality as the web portal 1410.  Specifically, the application may be configured to implement any of the methods, processes, mechanisms, etc. described herein in FIGS. 1-9.  Using the application,
the first user 1420 may create a message of sequenced images on the mobile device 1300.  The application may allow the first user 1420 to send the message to the second user 1422 via the network 1424.  For example, the message may be sent through any
form known in the art, including, but not limited to, emails, web link, picture message via Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), text message via Short Message Service (SMS), tweet via Twitter.RTM., instant message, Facebook.RTM.  update, and the like. 
The second user 1422 does not necessarily have to be configured with the application for receipt of the message.  The second user 1422 may receive the message via conventional mechanisms.
<br/><br/> In an exemplary embodiment in the application-based scenario 1402, the first user 1420 may connect once or periodically to the web portal 1410 (or another server).  For example, the web portal 1410 may provide the application in downloaded form
to the mobile device 1300.  It is expected that the first user 1420 may connect to the web portal 1410 for initial download and installation of the application.  Furthermore, the first user 1420 may connect to the web portal 1410 periodically for
updates, image synchronization, and the like.
<br/><br/> In both the web portal-based scenario 1400 and the application-based scenario 1402, the web portal 1410 may include a visual dictionary as part of the data store 1208 and the memory 1210.  As described herein, the visual dictionary includes a
plurality of images used to create messages.  FIG. 5 illustrates using the visual dictionary for creating a message, and FIG. 6 illustrates adding new images into the visual dictionary.  In the web portal-based scenario 1400, the visual dictionary may be
extremely large with billions and billions of images stored at the web portal 1410.  Note, each user may have a customized visual dictionary, but a particular image may be stored once and tagged separately for each user.  That is, the visual dictionary
for the web portal 1410 may include a vast plurality of images along with individual dictionaries for a plurality of users with the individual dictionaries including specific images of the plurality of images.
<br/><br/> In the application-based scenario 1402, the visual dictionary may be referred to as a local visual dictionary that is stored within the mobile device 1300 (e.g. in the data store 1318, the memory 1322, etc.).  The application-based scenario 1402
may be constrained in an amount of storage available at the mobile device 1300 for the visual dictionary.  As storage amounts increase in the mobile device 1300, the local visual dictionary may include more images.  In an exemplary embodiment, the local
visual dictionary may include a subset of the plurality of images stored in the web portal 1410.  This subset may be user-defined, dynamically adjusted based on usage history, predetermined, and the like.  Furthermore, the mobile device 1300 may
synchronize with the web portal 1410 on a periodic basis to upload/download new images and the like.
<br/><br/> In an exemplary embodiment, a user in the application-based scenario 1402 may also be a user in the web portal-based scenario 1400.  Here, the user may define a visual dictionary on the web portal 1410 that is synchronized with the mobile device
1300.  For example, the user may enter the web portal and select particular images of the plurality of images on the web portal 1410 for use in the local visual dictionary.  Alternatively, the web portal 1410 may be configured to cache recently used
images of the user and to synchronize these in the local visual dictionary.
<br/><br/> Palette of Forms
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 13-24, in various exemplary embodiments, the present disclosure may be utilized building and managing a layered dialogue of a community using electronic dialogue communication amongst a plurality of users.  Since the invention
of the printing press, words have dominated communication, and there are few other communication methods beside the "I talk, you listen and respond" format, and their use is very limited, such as hand sign language for the deaf.  More recently, with the
advent of text messaging, a limited set of simple symbols, like "smiley or sad faces" are being added to word messages.  These simple symbols lack any rich or descriptive meaning and as such, are normally used to end a conversation.  Still, the simple
symbols are put in simple word sentences and inserted into the "I talk, you listen and respond" conversation format.
<br/><br/> The electronic communications dialog systems and methods described herein utilizes sentences based on images as the fundamental component of a sentence.  However, this new system continues to use the "I talk, you listen and respond" conversation
format demanded by word-based systems.  It is as though the command and control mechanism of the spoken or written word is commanding the communication using images, where no such command and control is required.  The electronic communications dialog
systems and methods described herein may be utilized to allow unique and flexible methods to create a new conversation flow of image, sentences, or visual templates for individuals or defined communities.  Without the use of words, and by using images,
hundreds (or thousands or millions of geographically diverse language backgrounds) of community members may visually talk simultaneously or in new organized flows.
<br/><br/> The current "I talk, you listen" command and control communication mechanism may be replaced by a system and method that uses visual templates uniquely inserted, arranged, rearranged, and reused in many new conversation style forums assembled in
a predetermined sequence for a specific community, e.g. inserting a visual template of a complete new business idea in an editor forum ensures it will be focused upon, and then inserted in a circle peer forum to expand the idea, and finally to be
inserted into a workflow forum to be approved and quickly implemented ensures that the idea gets fully explored, expanded, approved and then correctly implemented.  Three different command and control communication mechanism where used on one template
distributed among many forums and an unlimited number of members.  Therefore, it is desirable to build a communication system and method that uses visual templates inserted into any number of predetermined forum styles organized in a precise flow by
community members.
<br/><br/> Collectively, FIGS. 13-24 described a "palette of forms" using the electronic communications dialog systems and methods described herein outside the standard "I talk, you listen" structure.  FIG. 13 illustrates an overview of the palette which
contains a sample of the possible conversation forum styles used individually or in a collective process flow for a community.  Specifically, exemplary conversation forum styles may include a circle peer forum 2002 described in FIG. 15, an editor forum
2004 described in FIG. 16, a topic wall 2006 described in FIG. 17, a workflow forum 2008 described in FIG. 18, posting style 2010 described in FIG. 19, and linear style 2012 described in FIG. 20.  FIGS. 15-20 illustrate exemplary forums that may be
created using the visual image communication system and method of the present disclosure.  A lead member may select a particular forum style or styles for the community and put them in a defined sequence (examples are illustrated in FIGS. 21-24). 
Individual members may access the community forums by entering a portal (via computer browser, a PDA browser, smart phone browser, etc), joining a community, and entering their visual templates in the specific forum or flow of forums.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 illustrates a visual template 2110A which may be used in a conversation sentences, threads, etc. flowing through the structure of the forums described in FIGS. 15-20.  As described in FIG. 9, the visual template 2110A may include a
visual sentence 210, a visual paragraph 220, a visual book 250, and the like, each of which contain images as the basic foundation for conveying a message.  In FIGS. 15-20, this visual template 2110A structure is summarized in a message block (2110A)
from a specific member (10), for example 2110A is the first visual template message from member 10 with the last digits referring to the member and A referring to the first message sent.  Further, 2110B is the send message from member 10, 2111A is a
first message from member 11, etc. In this manner, FIGS. 15-20 illustrate message flows from various members 2200 using the visual templates 21XXn where XX is the member on the FIG. and n is the sequenced message from the member.
<br/><br/> FIG. 15 illustrates the circle peer forum 2002 where an entire community of members 2200 may access to view, respond, etc. to all visual templates 2110.  The circle peer forum 2002 conversation style allows all members 2200 (10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
etc) to see all other members visual templates 2110 and to respond to all other visual templates.  For example, the various visual templates 2110 may be "posted" in a community view 2202 where all members 2200 may view, respond, etc. The community view
2202 may be physically stored at web portal 10 and accessed by the members 2200 via a mobile device 1300 or the like.  The circle peer forum 2002 is useful for openly discussing an issue (a point, an idea, etc) to get all relevant facts, points of view,
etc. to fully understand the issue.  In operation, a member 2200 may click on any visual template 2110 from another member (e.g. the visual template 2110A) and respond (e.g. the visual template 2110B), and other members 2200 may respond to any of the
other members 2200 and the circle peer forum 2002 keeps track.
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 illustrates the editor forum 2004 where an entire community submits their visual templates 2110 to one editor 2290, and the editor 2290 is the only one who can see these submitted visual templates 2110, but the editor 2290 selects some
visual templates 2110 to publish to the entire community to see in the community view 2202.  The editor forum 2004 is particularly useful for communities who want to have a clear decision on all conversations.  For example, in FIG. 16, the editor 2290
selects only the visual templates 2110A, 2114B for the community view 2202.
<br/><br/> FIG. 17 illustrates the topic wall 2006 where all the members 2200 can select a specific issue on a topic wall 2300 and submit the visual templates 2110 to that issue for others to view.  The topic wall 2006 is particularly useful for large
communities that have many different subjects to discuss.  For example, the topic wall 2300 may be physically stored at web portal 10 and accessed by the members 2200 via a mobile device 1300 or the like.  The topic wall 2006 may include any topic such
as, for example, issues, events, people, projects, missions, play, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 illustrates the workflow forum 2008 where all of the members 2200 can see the entire flow in the community view 2202, but only certain of the members 2200 can comment on the visual templates 2110 at certain times in the flow.  The
workflow forum 2008 allows all of the members 2200 to view and comment on a subject as it moves through various different viewpoints, e.g. different departments in a corporation, with the end result being a conversation that has moved in a linear fashion
through different groups.  This is particularly useful for communities who want to ensure certain key functions have reviewed and commented.
<br/><br/> FIG. 19 illustrates the posting style 2010 where a specific member 2200 creates an ongoing story where other members 2200 can insert their visual template 2110 comments.  The posting style 2010 allows individual members 2200 to keep a running
portrayal of their visual templates 2110 over time, with the ability of other members 2200 to comment with their visual templates 2110 on any part of the running portrayal.  This is particularly useful for individuals and groups to share a developing
story, activity, thought, etc over time and review how that area changed over time and who had input.
<br/><br/> FIG. 20 illustrates the linear style 2012 where all of the members 2200 can enter the flow of a conversation 2400 at any point.  The linear style 2012 allows the members 2200 to send messages and respond to messages and show the linear
progression of the conversation 2400.  This is intended to keep track of basic conversations between a few individual members 2200.
<br/><br/> Creating a Community with Profiles and Layered Forum Conversations
<br/><br/> In the word dominated world of "I talk, you Listen", the flow of the conversation is already defined, so there is little need when using words to change the conversation style.  Using visual templates 2110 as the basis of communication instead
of words, the flow of the first conversation and each subsequent conversation among a few members 2200 or all members 2200 can be designed and determined by community leader(s).  A community leader will want the flexibility to start a conversation in
certain way and have the flow of the conversation evolve into different conversation forums.
<br/><br/> FIG. 21 illustrates a flowchart of an exemplary embodiment 2500 for a community leader(s) to build a new community with the desired layered conversations for visual templates.  As described herein, a community leader, member, etc. is an
individual with a device, component, etc. configured to utilize the visual templates via the portal 10 and the like.  In the exemplary embodiment 2500, a leader logs into the portal 10 (step 2502) to create a profile allowing individual members to sign
up (step 2504), to articulate rules to guide member creation of public and private visual dictionaries and visual libraries (2506), and to organize a conversation flow from a palette (2508).  At this point, users, etc. may login through the profile (step
2510), and the users, now members, may participate fully by adding their visual template messages to the forums (step 2512).
<br/><br/> Thus, the present disclosure may be utilized for building and managing the layered dialogue of a community using electronic dialogue communication (e.g. via images) amongst a plurality of users.  The users may be based on a community definition
that includes common binding membership elements.  The community leaders may use structures from a palette of forums defining how the flow of dialogue progresses and evolves among users.  Users may participate by submitting their visual templates (i.e.
sentences, paragraphs, books, etc.) into the dialogue flow.
<br/><br/> To initiate a community, leaders select certain membership criteria, certain visual dictionary and visual library rules.  The leaders may select from a palette the type of conversations (e.g. circle peer style, an editor style, a topic wall
style, a workflow style, a posting style, etc.) and then sequence them in a predetermined flow.  Users can enter the entire conversation flow or just parts thereof of their choosing to engage in dialogue.
<br/><br/> To initiate or join a conversation, a user first selects the preferred community(ies) they are a member of, and upon entry scans all the conversations, and adds their appropriate template in a conversation, or creates a new conversation directed
at members they chose.  The user can enter discussion at various points.  The user creates their templates from a set of templates already created by the community, or from their private library of templates and completed templates.  To insert images
into a template, a user selects the images from the community visual dictionary, their own private dictionary, or another public source.  Once the user inserts their template into the conversation, they press send and others in the conversation can see
the addition.  The template can be viewed in multiple conversations.  Millions of users can interact in real time together with this method.
<br/><br/> One use of the system and method is for private individuals in a community to carry on many conversations about what events, issues, projects, activities, etc. are important now and in the future, so a conversations starts with a topic wall type
to show all the conversations possible, followed by a circle peer style to focus on a specific area, and finalized with an editor style to reach a publicized consensus.  Another use of the system and method is for a business to solve a critical problem,
so a conversation starts with the editor style to select the most important problem, followed by a circle peer style to find potential solutions, followed by a work flow style to gain acceptance of certain solutions.  Another use of the system is for a
group (of friends, of zoologists, etc.) who want to track their day or produce books of common interest, so they start with a posting method to share thoughts, followed by an editor method to finalize the output.
<br/><br/>Example
<br/><br/>Community Flow for Wide Variety of Subject Matter
<br/><br/> FIG. 22 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of selection of several forum styles ordered in a sequence to facilitate individual discussions on a wide range of topics.  To create a socially conscious community 1) exposed to certain major issues
of the day and 2) capable of creating positive action steps for the community, the community leader may enter the portal and creates a community using the exemplary embodiment 2500.  For example, to create the structure of the conversation flow, the
leader selects the wall forum 2006 from the palette and uses this as the first conversation flow piece to create and select all issues.  Future members can enter this wall forum 2006 in the community and add issues, topics, etc for discussion.  Realizing
that the community will want to do more than list and view all issues, the leader selects the circle peer style 2002 from the palette and inserts this forum in the community, allowing users to take an issue from the wall forum 2006 and make that issue
the center of discussion for a circle peer style 2002, and user can all see the discussion about the issue and contribute as needed.  In the circle peer style 2002, the issue is fully explored by interested members from all viewpoints and perspectives. 
Realizing that certain members may want to take a fully explored issue from the circle peer flow and publicize the "correct" viewpoint, the leader takes the editor forum style 2004 and makes this the last in the layered conversations.  So a member
selects an issue from the circle peer style 2002 and publishes their editor view in the editor forum style 2004, and the editor receives comments only the editor can see, and the editor publishes to the community only what the editor wants.
<br/><br/>Example
<br/><br/>Community Flow for Solving Business Problems
<br/><br/> FIG. 23 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of selection of several forum styles ordered in a sequence to facilitate a business group to solve a specific complex problem.  To create a business community designed to solve complex business
problems, a company leader enters the portal and creates a community using the exemplary embodiment 2500.  To create the structure of the conversation flow, the leader selects the editor forum 2004 from the palette and uses this to collect ideas from
members on a published public problem the editor is addressing.  The editor takes the solution idea and publishes only the ones the editor selects have merit, as judged by the editors' skills and experience.  The leader anticipates that the layered
conversation should next include a circle peer forum 2002, so the leader takes the forum from the palette and inserts it in the layered conversation.  This allows a member to take a published editor visual template from the editor style and make it the
central item of the circle peer forum 2002, thus allowing all member to add to and build the core solution.  Next the leader anticipates reaching a final consensus on the right solution from each impacted company department perspective, the leader next
adds the work flow forum 2008 into the layered conversation.  The solution in visual template format enters the work flow forum 2008 and each department in the work flow adds there visual template messages.  In this fashion, a company leader created the
community using a specific layered conversation flow, and this community is good at solving complex business problems from all perspectives.
<br/><br/>Example
<br/><br/>Community Flow for Posting Thoughts and Publishing a Result
<br/><br/> FIG. 24 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of selection of a couple of forum styles ordered in a sequence to facilitate full understanding of a detailed subject.  A leader believes the community members want to express their beliefs as they
experience life, so members want to keep a public daily log(or any time increment) of visual templates.  So the leader forms a community with the starting layered conversation as a posting style 2010 forum.  As the wisdom in the community grows, special
experts want to summarize the wisdom, so the leader next adds an editor forum 2004 to the layered conversation so members have the ability to become expert prognosticators.
<br/><br/> Content Distribution Systems and Methods
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 25, in an exemplary embodiment, a content distribution network 2500 is illustrated for content distribution systems and methods between users via sequences of digital images.  Note, while described herein as content
distribution systems and methods and the content distribution network 2500, these can also be referred to as content delivery.  The content distribution network 2500 includes a host server 2502 communicatively coupled to a plurality of users 2504 through
a network 2506.  The host server 2502 provides a mechanism for the plurality of users 2504 to access content store via data stores 2508, 2510.  The host server 2502 can be similar to the server 1200 or variations thereof.  The users 2504 can be similar
to the mobile device 1300 or variations thereof.  Also, the users 2504 can include other types of devices, such as, but not limited to televisions, computers, Internet appliances, content servers, or any type of device configured to interact with
content.  The data store 2508 can be local with respect to the host server 2502, and the data store 2510 can be remote from the host server 2502 connected via the network 2506.  The content distribution systems and methods contemplate either or both
implementations.  The network 2506 can be the Internet or generally any data communication network for content distribution thereon.
<br/><br/> The term content used herein can refer to any type of data received over the content distribution network 2500.  Exemplary content can include video, music, text, graphics, web sites, web objects, documents, live streaming media, database
results, software, and the like.  In exemplary embodiments, the content distribution network 2500 can be a cable television network (CATV), a multiple service offering (MSO) network, a wireless provider network, and the like.  The host server 2502 is
configured to provide interaction between the users 2504 and the content stored in the data stores 2508, 2510.  In an exemplary embodiment, the host server 2502 enables interaction between the users 2504 and the content stored in the data stores 2508,
2510 using the sequences of digital images described herein.  The content distribution systems and methods can be viewed as using the aforementioned systems and methods in FIGS. 1-24 for content distribution, selection, viewing, editing,
redirecting/repurposing, and the like.  That is, the aforementioned images, dictionaries, palette of forms, etc. can be used in conjunction with the host server 2502 and the users 2504 for interaction with the content stored in the data stores 2508,
2510.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 26, in an exemplary embodiment, a user interface 2600 is illustrated for content distribution systems and methods via sequences of digital images.  With respect to the content distribution network 2500, the user interface 2600
can be associated with one of the users 2504 and their associated device with the user interface 2600.  The user interface 2600 is configured to enable user interaction with the content stored in the data stores 2508, 2510 using a plurality of images
2602 displayed thereon.  The user interface 2600 can receive the images 2602 from the host server 2502 and interact with the content stored in the data stores 2508, 2510 through the host server 2502.  That is, the content distribution systems and methods
provide a dialogue between the users 2504 and the content stored in the data stores 2508, 2510 through the host server 2502.  This dialogue between the users 2504 and the content uses pictures as the primary mode of dialogue.
<br/><br/> As described herein, the images 2602 include one of a plurality of images from a visual dictionary associated with the user 2504 or a general visual dictionary.  Each image 2602 can have a direct correspondence with a plurality of words
previously associated with the image 2602 such that the image 2602 is configured to convey a message represented by the plurality of words to the user 2504.  Each of the images 2602 can include a definition provided by the user such that each of the
plurality of images conveys one or more words based on the definition or a general definition.
<br/><br/> In an exemplary embodiment, each of the images 2602 is a link or pointer to underlying content, such as content stored in the data stores 2508, 2510.  The user interface 2600 is configured to enable an end user to select one of the images 2602
(or multiple images 2602, etc.).  This selection can be through a touch screen, a stylus pen, a mouse, a keyboard, a keypad, a pointer, a remote control, and the like.  For interaction, the images 2602 allow the end user to select, expand, and view.  For
example, the user can select a particular image 2602a with the user interface 2600 expanding to show additional images 2602b.  The user can select one of the additional images 2602b to be redirected to content 2610.  In an exemplary embodiment, each of
the images 2602 is a stand-alone image with no corresponding text associated therewith (of course text can be part of the image).  Here, the image 2602 alone is used to visually convey a message to the user 2504 of the underlying content.  In another
exemplary embodiment, each of the images 2602 can include corresponding text for a short description thereof.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 27, in an exemplary embodiment, a television 2700 is illustrated for utilizing content distribution systems and methods via sequences of digital images in television applications.  The television 2700 can be part of the content
distribution network 2500 belonging to one of the users 2504 and being connected to the host server 2502 over the network 2506.  In this example, the network 2506 can include the CATV/MSO network, e.g. coax, fiber-to-the-home, etc., a satellite provider,
an Internet television provider, etc. Note, while not shown, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the television 2700 can be connected to a set top box or equivalent (i.e., a network interface device) for data communications with the host
server 2502.  The television 2700 includes a display 2702 for displaying content and images 2602 thereon.  In an exemplary embodiment, the display 2702 is segmented into two sections--a display screen section 2704 and an image bar 2706 with a plurality
of images 2602.
<br/><br/> In essence, the television 2700 in the content distribution network 2500 replaces a conventional display with a visual talking system that allows the host server 2502 to send a guide like system to any user 2504 with all the content embedded in
the message via links using the images 2602.  The television 2700 can show a visual list of all content simultaneously through the images 2602 to view, select, etc. across all digital platforms.  A user selects content to explore more, i.e. through
clicking, selecting, touching, a remote control, etc. Subsequent to selection, the television 2700 can display all the options to expand, view, watch (like a video), and/or to redirect to a friend or add to your own content and redirect (this could also
include a built in licensing system for copyrights assignment, etc).
<br/><br/> The images 2602 on the display screen 2702 can enable a user to pull in content from the content distribution network 2500.  In the example of FIG. 27, the display screen 2702 includes images 2602-10, 2602-20, 2602-30, 2602-60, 2602-110,
2602-120.  Selection of the image 2602-10 can be for the user to view a series of products, for example, denoted by images 2602-10, 2602-11, 2602-12, 2602-13.  Selection of the image 2602-20 can be for the user to view a presentation, for example,
denoted by images 2602-20, 2602-21, 2602-22, 2602-23.  Selection of the image 2602-30 can be for the user to view a book or journal, for example, denoted by images 2602-30, 2602-31, 2602-32, 2602-33.  Selection of the image 2602-60 can be for the user to
view a series of coupons, for example, denoted by images 2602-60, 2602-61, 2602-62, 2602-63.  Selection of the image 2602-110 can be for the user to view a contest or auction, for example, denoted by images 2602-110, 2602-111, 2602-112, 2602-113. 
Finally, selection of the image 2602-120 can be for the user to watch a video, for example, denoted by images 2602-120, 2602-121.  Of course, the foregoing are presented as exemplary embodiments for illustration purposes.
<br/><br/> In another exemplary embodiment, the display screen 2702 can be solely filled with the images 2602, similar to the user interface 2600.  A plurality of images 2602 can be simultaneously displayed on the display screen 2702, such as for example,
fifty images 2702 with each of the images 2602 indicative of a video or channel.  The user can, for example, select one of the images 2602 to see a sample of that video or channel, and then, optionally, select the image 2602 again to pay for or watch the
video or channel.  The user can also freely manipulate the placement, order, etc. of the images 2602 bringing in favorite videos or channels.  The user can vote and/or rank videos or channels, and the like.
<br/><br/> It is expected that the content distribution systems and methods form a new paradigm for content delivery such as, for example, in cable television, satellite television, etc. The images 2602 can be pointers to the actual content, i.e. the
content associated with each image 2602 is underneath the image, overturned upon selection.  From the display screen 2702, it is expected the user can select television programs, web videos, magazines, news articles, movies, music, etc. In essence, the
images 2602 are abstractions of the associated content in the content distribution network.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 28 and 29, in exemplary embodiments, display screens 2800, 2802 are illustrated for utilizing content distribution systems and methods via sequences of digital images on a computer and a mobile device.  The display screen 2800
can be from a computer, and the display screen 2802 can be from a mobile device (e.g., cell phone) with the computer and the mobile device being associated with users 2504 in the content distribution network 2500.  The display screens 2800, 2802 can
operate similarly to the display screen 2702 described with respect to the television 2700.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 30, in an exemplary embodiment, exemplary message styles 210, 220, 250 are illustrated using the images 2602 in the content distribution network 2500.  In particular, FIG. 30 includes aspects described herein in FIG. 9 with a
sentence 210 being a sequence of images 2602, a paragraph 220 being a sequence of sentences 210, and a story 250 (or book) being a sequence of paragraphs 220.  The sentences 210, paragraphs 220, etc. can be displayed in the content distribution network
2500 such as on the user interface 2600 and the display screens 2700, 2800, 2802.  The sentences 210, paragraphs 220, etc. can flow across the screen.  Generally, the sentences 210, paragraphs 220, etc. are meant to provide arresting, Captivating,
Elegantly Styled Messages (On TV, Smart Phone, PC, or Any Digital Device).
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 31, in an exemplary embodiment, exemplary images 2602-1-2602-6 are illustrated for display on the user interface 2600 and the display screens 2700, 2800, 2802.  For example, the image 2602-1 can be to watch the game tonight and
selecting it could create a reminder and/or record the game, or if the game is in progress, bring the game on screen.  The image 2602-2 can be to provide a user's opinion of who will win the game.  The image 2602-3 can be for a promotion code associated
with a sweepstakes.  The image 2602-4 can be to provide details to the user for a sale.  The image 2602-5 can be to provide details to the user for an auto dealership.  Finally, the image 2602-6 can be for the user to buy tickets.  Those of ordinary
skill in the art will recognize the images 2602 can relate to practically anything.  The images 2602 enable more efficient mechanisms to reach users such as relative to banner ads and analytics.  The new analytics can include an ability to follow who
uses specific images in what type of content along with tracking information (sent where, when, etc.).  Current word communication systems do not have a same ability of tracking for analytics.  This is an advantage of the systems and methods described
herein using sequences of digital images.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 32, in an exemplary embodiment, a flow diagram illustrates interactive visual messages 3200 over the content distribution network 2500.  The visual messages 3200 provide interactive messages anywhere, everywhere at anytime to
any digital device.  In this example, the visual messages 3200 are in a cascaded format, i.e. the messages cascade forming a cascading communication system.  First, the messages 3200 are delivered to an intended audience.  This can be from the host
server 2502 to intended users 2504.  It is expected that the receiving users 2504 will forward with appropriate actions, there forwarded users 2504 will forward with appropriate actions, etc. There can be bulk sending of the messages 3200 to an entire
community, etc. Further, the host server 2502 can monitor the movement of the messages 3200 and the actions associated therewith.  Also, each user 2504 can provide their own content, i.e. organize content and distribute it to other users 2504.  Again,
the content can include analytics as described herein.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 33, in an exemplary embodiment, a flowchart illustrates a method 3300 for building an activity flow of content, distributing it, and adapting it.  In an exemplary embodiment, the method 3300 can use the content distribution
network 2500 being operated by the users 2504 and distributed therebetween.  The activity flow of content can be the images 2602 and the underlying content associated therewith.  In the following, the method 3300 is described with reference to examples
related to a book (e.g., a bible story).  First, an activity flow path/sequence is created (step 3302).  This can include, for the book, selecting a bible verse and leaving blank spots for users to insert the images 2602 related thereto.  Users then
insert content (step 3304).  Here, the users can insert pictures for the images 2602 to tell the story of the bible verse.  Next, the users can display the selected content with certain users or a targeted group voting on the best content (step 3306). 
The elected content can be distributed (step 3308).  For example, the content can be distributed to interested audiences, e.g. those who buy religious books.  Finally, Others use the path to update, improve, add and grow content in a collaborative,
recursive, and crowd sourced format (step 3310).
<br/><br/> The method 3300 can be used for "Activity managed flow" using the sequential digital images.  This can be done in a variety of applications with users crowd sourcing development of projects.  For example, this can be done with respect to games,
building a video or visual story, building a manual, etc. Generally, the sequential digital images described herein can be used for content distribution as well as for content creation, i.e. in building and managing activities such as described herein
relative to the method 3300.  Generally, the method 3300 and variants thereof can be viewed as crowd sourcing where plural users work together to provide content items.  This can be seen as the opposite of Twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> etc. where individual users
publish content for viewing by plural users.  Here, the users work together to form the content akin to a swarm of bees coming in, putting their thoughts into content, and allowing the group of users to select the best.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 34-36, in exemplary embodiments, diagrams and a table illustrate unique skin analytic systems and methods for managing a user's own visual content.  This management can be coupled with the sequential digital image systems and
methods variously described herein or separately.  Conventionally, with millions of "pictures" of the same thing, and millions more growing each day, using word/number tags to identify pictures and related content (e.g., videos, visual sentence &amp; books,
etc.) will not fully solve the identification problem, that is who owns what, how it was used, what sequence it went through (i.e., evolution derivations, etc.).  Thus, unique skin analytic systems and methods can be used such that all visual content (or
any other digital content) includes an added "skin" that envelopes all of the content, in either a visual or hidden manner.  Importantly, the skin follows the flow of the content as it evolves, is derived, etc. The skins can be layered on top of each
content such that as additions are made, by a new user, another skin is added in addition to the first skin (or any previous skins).  Thus, skins can presumably be added until infinity.  The skins can be followed by their user anywhere.  Coupled with
this marking of visual content with skins, skin analytics can show usage, timing, sequencing, and follow the flow of use in all forms of digital communication (PC, mobile devices, TV, tablet pads, etc.).
<br/><br/> FIGS. 34-35 include multiple unique skins 3400A-34001 with a unique skin 3400 for each user.  In these exemplary embodiments, the skins 3400 are depicted as different shapes, i.e. a different shape for each user.  The image owner or originator
places a corresponding skin 3400 on content.  For example, the user associated with skin 3400A can own or create an image 3402 and embed the skin 3400A thereon or therein.  In another example, the user associated with skin 3400E can take the image 3402
and embed their skin 3400E in addition to the skin 3400A on the image 3402 in a manner tracking the use, ownership, etc. of the image 3402.  The user associated with skin 3400A can also own or create a sentence/template 3404 and embed the skin 3400A
thereon or therein.  The sentence/template 3404 can use the image 3402 with both the skins 3400A, 3400E and another image 3406 with a skin 3400E.  Even further, the user associated with the skin 3400H can create another sentence/template 3408 made up of
the images 3402, 3406 with their respective skins 3400 and other images.  Note, while the skin 3400 is illustrated as a geometric shape, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize it can be anything embedded in or on the image 3402 to uniquely
identify the owner of the image 3402.  This can include, but is not limited to, watermarking, steganography, distinguishing patterns added to the image 3402, labels or the like added to the image 3402, portrait frames on or around the image 3402, and the
like.  Further, as noted in the sentence/templates 3404, 3406, the skins 3400 can be embedded upon other skins 3400.  Additionally, FIG. 35 illustrates the use of images with the skins 3400 in paragraphs 3502, 3504.
<br/><br/> FIG. 36 illustrates a table 3600 that can be used to track the skins 3400 and their associated usage.  The skins 3400 enable tracking of the images 3402, 3406 and their use in a visual talking context (or in any use).  Advantageously, the skins
3400 are easier to use and less complex than a word-based metadata system.  That is, the skins 3400 are embedded in, on, etc. the image, not extra metadata attached to the image file.  Thus, when passed around, images do not need to take metadata with
them, but rather the skins 3400 travel in or on the image.  Metadata can still be maintained, but in the present invention, the metadata can remain with the owner of the image, and is not required to travel with the image.  The skins 3400 are also better
than other conventional tracking methods, such as cookies, in that they do not enable spying or tracking of users.  Rather, the skins 3400 track the use of the images.  The image owner can get the analytics and it could be up to the skin owner as to
whether to share this data.  The table 3600 illustrates one exemplary analytics system/method using the skins 3400.  For example, the table 3600 tracks items in the visual talking systems and methods described herein, i.e. images, sentences, books,
templates, sequences, etc. Each of these items include sequenced digital images for conveying messages in lieu of words, i.e. "visual talking" Using the skins 3400, the user can track how many times an item is seen, used, by whom, etc. This also can be
used to implement a copyright and/or royalty system for licensing, etc.
<br/><br/> Cylindrical User Interface Systems and Methods
<br/><br/> With the various exemplary embodiments described herein, images or sequenced images are presented to a plurality of users for conveying information thereto.  As visual communicators grow both with the various exemplary embodiments described
herein and the like, more efficient systems and methods are needed for viewing, selecting, adding, editing, and reading visual images.  Conventional user interfaces include flat spaces in all directions that are too slow, cumbersome, difficult to manage,
etc. Thus, systems and methods are described presenting digital images utilizing an infinite cylinder user interface.  The infinite cylinder user interface contemplates use on a computer monitor, television, mobile device screen, projector, etc. as an
efficient mechanism to present images to a user such as with image dictionaries, sentence libraries, image searches, saved images, etc.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 37A-37C, in an exemplary embodiment, schematic diagrams illustrate an infinite cylinder user interface 3700.  The infinite cylinder user interface 3700 can be presented in any manipulateable visual format to efficiently
present images to a user.  The manipulateable visual formats include any formats where a user can move, select, scroll, drill-down, etc. such as computer screens with associated user inputs, touch screens, etc. FIG. 37A illustrates the infinite cylinder
user interface 3700 in a perspective view.  Note, in implementation, the infinite cylinder user interface 3700 is likely presented through a two-dimensional screen, but the perspective view is shown to show the various degrees of freedom in presenting
images to a user through the infinite cylinder user interface 3700.  FIG. 37B is a cross-sectional view of the perspective view of FIG. 37A.  Finally, FIG. 37C is a screen shot view of the infinite cylinder user interface 3700.
<br/><br/> The perspective view of FIG. 37A illustrates two modes of movement of the infinite cylinder user interface 3700.  First, the infinite cylinder user interface 3700 can be moved along with associated images displayed thereon infinitely along an
x-axis in either direction.  Second, the infinite cylinder user interface 3700 can be spun along the x-axis to show different images thereon.  Note, while FIGS. 37A-37B show the cylindrical surface as being finite, the spinning about the x-axis can be
infinite or extremely large.  The cross-sectional view of FIG. 37B illustrates another mode of movement, i.e. a third mode, where there can be infinite cylinders within cylinders, i.e. drill-down and/or drill-up.  For example, assume the cylinder in FIG.
37A is cylinder 10,000, there can be a cylinder 10,001 in which cylinder 10,000 is contained and/or a cylinder 9,999 that is contained within cylinder 10,000.  Here, the user can drill-down and/or up to move between cylinders.  FIG. 37C illustrates the
infinite cylinder user interface 3700 on a two-dimensional screen.  Here, there are plural images 3702 that are presented in the infinite cylinder user interface 3700 and the user can perform any of the three modes of movement to display images on the
screen, i.e. longitudinally along the x-axis, spinning about the x-axis, and drilling up and/or down from each cylinder.
<br/><br/> Thus, with the infinite cylinder user interface 3700, cylinder surfaces can roll in either direction to infinity or stretch lengthwise in either direction to infinity.  Cylinders can be inside one another until infinity, and the track from one
cylinder to another to another and so on can be followed forward and backward.  Cylinders can be related to each other in an infinite pattern to express 1) higher levels of related content building (i.e., image cylinder sends to sentence cylinder, to
paragraph cylinder, to book, etc.) and 2) to track all levels of conversation flow.  So, each person can have their own infinite cylinders that are their dictionaries, libraries, conversations, etc.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 38, in an exemplary embodiment, a schematic diagram illustrates various cylinders in the infinite cylinder user interface 3700 showing exemplary relationships therebetween.  A first cylinder 10,100 is an image dictionary with a
plurality of images associated therewith such as an image 10X.  From the cylinder 10,100, a user can drill down to cylinders 10,099, 10,098, etc. where images 10a10, 10b10 are found.  Note, there can be correlation or other relationships between the
images 10X, 10a10, 10b10, etc. There can also be cylinders 15,100, 15,099, 15,098, 20,100, 20,099, 20,098, etc. Here the cylinders 15,100, 15,099, 15,098 can be sentence libraries of the images in the cylinders 10,100, 10,099, 10,098, and the cylinders
20,100, 20,099, 20,098 can be paragraph libraries of the sentence libraries, and so on.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 39, in an exemplary embodiment, a schematic diagram illustrates a public dictionary cylinder 3900, a private dictionary cylinder 3902, and a private sentence cylinder 3904 and relationships therebetween.  The public dictionary
cylinder 3900 can be available for use by any of a plurality of users while the private dictionary cylinder 3902 can be associated with a specific user and thus only available to that specific user.  The specific user can take images from the public
dictionary cylinder 3900 and include them in the private dictionary cylinder 3902 and vice versa.  Also, the specific user can have the private sentence cylinder 3904 in which the user includes images from both the cylinders 3900, 3902.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 40, in an exemplary embodiment, a schematic diagram illustrates various cylinders 4000 including images from the exemplary conversation forum styles in FIGS. 15-20.  For example, one cylinder 4000 includes the circle peer forum
2002, another includes the editor forum 2004, another includes the topic wall 2006, another includes the workflow forum 2008, another includes the posting style 2010, another includes the linear style 2012, etc. That is, in an exemplary embodiment the
infinite cylinder user interface 3700 can be used to complement the exemplary conversation forum styles for the electronic communications dialog systems and methods.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 41, in an exemplary embodiment, a screen shot illustrates a plurality of cylinders 4100 on a user's screen.  For example, the plurality of cylinders 4100 can be presented in a summary screen as shown in FIG. 41, and a user can
select an individual cylinder 4100 for viewing particular images thereon.  The user can come back to this summary screen of FIG. 41 or traverse the various different modes of movement as described herein.
<br/><br/> In an exemplary embodiment, the infinite cylinder user interface 3700 can include a tracking mechanism for the plurality of cylinders 4100 that enable a user to easily maneuver around the system.  That is, the tracking mechanism can keep track
of the user's history or user flow.  Users can track the where they started and where they are now, so they can always go back and follow their track all the way back to the beginning, even if they jumped from cylinder to cylinder.
<br/><br/> Personalized Image Portal--Social Network
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 42, in an exemplary embodiment, a screen shot illustrates a user's personal image screen 4200 for the electronic communications dialog systems and methods.  As described herein, various systems and methods are described
relating fundamentally to the concept of using images as a basis for communication between users (e.g., in lieu of words).  These electronic communications dialog systems and methods can be extended to social media and/or to an individual portal page for
a user to express oneself via imagery as opposed to words.  The user's personal image screen 4200 can be a web portal, home page, social media site, blog, etc. where a user stores, manipulates, and displays images 4202 and/or conversation forum styles
2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 for public and/or private viewing.
<br/><br/> In an exemplary embodiment, the user's personal image screen 4200 is part of a social media platform where each user has their own screen 4200 (and optionally various infinite cylinder user interfaces 3700, dictionaries, etc.).  The user can
have friends, colleagues, acquaintances, etc. that are in their network and able to see the user's image screen 4200.  Alternatively, the user can set the image screen 4200 to public such that anyone can view it.  Of course, a subset of public/private
can also be used depending on the content on the image screen 4200.
<br/><br/> It will be appreciated that some exemplary embodiments described herein may include one or more generic or specialized processors (or "processing devices") such as microprocessors, digital signal processors, customized processors and field
programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and unique stored program instructions (including both software and firmware) that control the one or more processors to implement, in conjunction with certain non-processor circuits, some, most, or all of the functions
of the methods and/or systems described herein.  Alternatively, some or all functions may be implemented by a state machine that has no stored program instructions, or in one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), in which each
function or some combinations of certain of the functions are implemented as custom logic.  Of course, a combination of the two approaches may be used.  Moreover, some exemplary embodiments may be implemented as a computer-readable storage medium having
computer readable code stored thereon for programming a computer, server, appliance, device, etc. each of which may include a processor to perform methods as described and claimed herein.  Examples of such computer-readable storage mediums include, but
are not limited to, a hard disk, an optical storage device, a magnetic storage device, a ROM (Read Only Memory), a PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory), an EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory), an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read
Only Memory), a Flash memory, and the like.
<br/><br/> Although the present disclosure has been illustrated and described herein with reference to preferred embodiments and specific examples thereof, it will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other embodiments and
examples may perform similar functions and/or achieve like results.  All such equivalent embodiments and examples are within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure and are intended to be covered by the following claims.
