<br/><br/> In today's computer networks, users are utilizing more applications than ever before, and networks utilize application classification technologies to identify precisely which applications are running on the network in order to manage them more
effectively.  Due to the exponential increase of traffic volume in the network, network compression and optimization techniques were highly adopted.  Similar to the network bandwidth growth, cyber-threats has been exponentially growing.  Many companies
cite cyber threats as the top risk to their operations-higher than even the threat from natural disasters.  As a result, encryption of data in computer networks has become critical.
<br/><br/> Due to these two problems, many companies are currently using compression, optimization and encryption techniques.  However, application classification, and other functions associated with classified applications, conflict with, and are
complicated by, the technologies used in wide area networks to compress or encrypt or optimize traffic.  Thus, there is a need in the art for a method for classifying and managing applications over compressed or encrypted traffic in a network, including
without limitation, a WAN network.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Broadly described, the various embodiments of invention provide for a system and methods for providing application identification and management of applications in a network which includes compressed or optimized traffic ("compressed traffic"). 
In some embodiments, these same methods and systems may be utilized for application classification over encrypted traffic instead of compressed traffic.  In a first embodiment, a method, and associated system, of classifying applications over compressed
interfaces comprises the steps of: receiving uncompressed traffic including application data from a connection; determining an application classifier for application data; saving the application classifier for the connection; classifying any consecutive
packets from the connection with the same application classifier; and propagating the application classifier to the compressed interfaces.  A second embodiment provides a method, and associated system, for classifying applications over encrypted
interfaces instead of compressed interfaces as in the first embodiment.
<br/><br/> In the third embodiment, a method, and associated system, for managing applications over compressed interfaces comprises the steps of detecting compressed traffic originating from a first connection; acquiring the application classifier for the
compressed traffic; and, executing an application management process on the compressed traffic; and, returning an application management process output to the network.  The fourth embodiment provides a method, and associated system, for managing
applications over encrypted interfaces instead of compressed interfaces as in the third embodiment.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system according to the various embodiments of the invention.  Network 100 is a wide area network comprising a network core 102, which may include one or more routers serving as the backbone of network 100. 
Network core 102 comprises equipment to provide paths for the exchange of information between a plurality of subnetworks (106 and 110).  Each subnetwork includes a router (126 and 112, respectively), which may be coupled to one or more switches
(114-124).  Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various types and quantities of equipment and structure may be included in the network core and each subnetwork network within the spirit and scope of this invention.
<br/><br/> To optimize bandwidth in network 100, one or more devices may compress traffic in the network 100 (data compression devices).  These devices may comprise, without limitation, a router such as routers 126 and 112.  For purposes of illustration,
the routers 126 and 112 will be described as comprising the data compression devices in network 100 although other devices in network 100, such as the switches 114-124 may also serve as data compression devices.
<br/><br/> The data compression devices 126 and 112 comprise compression software to compress traffic, which includes one or more packets, from the respective subnetwork.  The compression software optimizes traffic from each subnetwork (106 or 110) in the
network 100.  This compression software (shown as "Compression Software" 905) may be stored in a storage system 904, as will be described further in FIG. 9.  In network 100, wherein the routers 126 and 112 are serving as the data compression devices, the
connection point between each router 126 and 112 in network 100, and the network core 102 is referred to as a "compression interface".  Each compression interface includes a connection for transmitting compressed data from one or more end user devices
148-162 in the respective subnetwork to the network.
<br/><br/> To safeguard communications in subnetwork networks 106 and 110, one or more devices may encrypt traffic in network 100 (data encryption devices).  As with the data compression devices, these devices may comprise, without limitation, a router
such as routers 126 and 112.  For purposes of illustration, the routers 126 and 112 will be described as comprising the data encryption devices in network 100 although other devices in network 100, such as the switches 114-124 may also serve as data
encryption devices.  These data encryption devices may include encryption software (shown as 907 in FIG. 9) for encrypting traffic in network 100.
<br/><br/> System 100 further includes one or more end user devices 148-162, wherein each end user device is communicatively coupled to a switch 114-124 (depending on the location of the end user device).  The connection between the end user devices
148-162 and switches 114-124 may comprise, without limitation, a WIFI connection or Ethernet connection.  End user devices 148-162 in system 100 may utilize one or more applications, such as a <b><i>Facebook</i></b> application or a YouTube application, which may
generate a plurality of application flows or packets (hereinafter referred to as "traffic" or "packets").
<br/><br/> Application recognition module (ARM) 104 may comprise a computer device (as described in FIG. 9) configured to perform various functions on compressed or encrypted traffic on network communication interface 108.  These various functions may
involve reporting or quality of service functions relating to the type of application(s) being utilized in the network.  This application recognition module may include any type of software developed for analyzing applications in a network environment,
including without limitation, the CISCO.RTM.  Application Visibility and Control (AVC) Solution.  The application recognition module (ARM) is configured to utilize the application classifier for the connection which originates the compressed or encrypted
traffic, rather than trying to execute application classification methods on the compressed or encrypted traffic.  The ARM is described in greater detail in the description of FIGS. 7 and 8.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating the application classification method of the second embodiment of the invention.  Method 200 could be executed by any computer device operating in the uncompressed interface of network 100, including without
limitation a router tasked with traffic compression shown as router 126 or 112 in FIG. 1.  Alternatively, another router or switch, such as switches 114-124, could also execute method 200 within the spirit and scope of the invention.
<br/><br/> Method 200 begins at step 202, and receives uncompressed traffic including application data for a connection in the subnetwork 106 or 110.  The application data may comprise any information that would help identify the application, including
without limitation, application name, size, path, run time information, code sections, source IP address, destination IP address, ports or protocols.  The application data could also comprise the name, version, or producing company of the application.
<br/><br/> At step 204, method 200 determines an application classifier for the application data.  This step 204 involves utilizing techniques used in application recognition modules, such as but without limitation, the Cisco.RTM.  Application Visibility
and Control technology, to identify which application is originating the packets based on the application data.  This step 204 may also involve utilizing a cloud-based application classification service which is communicatively coupled to network 100. 
The cloud-based application classification service may receive the application data, and after processing the application data, return an application classifier based on the cloud-based application classification service's algorithms and databases.
<br/><br/> At step 206, method 200 saves the application classifier for the connection.  The application classifier and any related L7 information, such as sub-classification information, is saved per connection.  If an end user device is originating the
uncompressed traffic, then the application classifier would be stored in the routers (126 or 112 in FIG. 1) or switches (114-124 in FIG. 1) in network 100.  However, this application classifier may be saved in any memory accessible by, or included in,
network 100.  For example, a router (such as router 126 or 112 in FIG. 1, with components as shown in FIG. 9) may store the application identifier in the storage system 904.
<br/><br/> At step 208, method 200 classifies any subsequent packets from the same connection with the same application identifier saved at step 206.  In an alternate embodiment, if an application identifier was not saved for the packets at step 206, and
an application classifier was previously stored at the same connection for previous packets, method 200 would involve the classification of the packets with the previously saved application identifier at step 208.
<br/><br/> At step 210, method 200 propagates the application classifier to the interfaces in the network 100.  This propagation step could involve any number of processes.  For example, the propagation step could include referencing a flow table which is
stored on the data compression device, which as previously described, is computer device in network 100 that is executing the traffic compression (such as router 126 or 112, or any of switches 114-124).  This flow table could include the network
locations to which the application classifier should be communicated within network 100.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates the method of the second embodiment of the invention, which comprises a method of classifying applications over encrypted traffic instead of compressed traffic as in the first embodiment.  Thus, method 300 involves the same
steps and processes as described in FIG. 2 for the first embodiment, except that encrypted traffic is received at step 302, and the application classification is performed on unencrypted traffic.  Further, the application classifier is propagated to
encrypted interfaces instead of compressed interfaces at step 310.  Similar to compression interfaces, encrypted interfaces comprise any connection in network 100 wherein traffic is being encrypted via encryption software.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a signaling diagram illustrating the signals exchanged between the network devices during execution of the method of the second embodiment of the invention.  In signaling diagram 400, end user device 402 outputs traffic from a
connection on the end user device (here, referred to as "Connection A" for exemplary purposes only), shown as signal 406, to router 104.  In the first embodiment, this traffic 406 comprises compressed traffic.  In the second embodiment, the traffic 406
comprises encrypted traffic.  Connection A may comprise any standard connector between an end user device and a network such as a WAN network.  Once router 104 receives the traffic 406, in both the first and second embodiments, router performs two
processes: an application classifier determination process 408 and an application classifier application process 410.
<br/><br/> The application classifier determination process 408 involves analysis of the application data to determine the application that "fits" the application data.  This process may involve utilizing a cloud-based traffic classification service which
receives the application data, and returns the application classifier as output.  The application classifier determination process could also involve the router 104 referencing a database of application classifiers, with associated characteristic
information, and selecting the application classifier with the closest match to the application data.  Those skilled in the art will appreciate that any number of methods could be utilized to select the application classifier within the various
embodiments of the invention.
<br/><br/> Application classification aims to determine the application used for any connection and is based on several different methods or even a combination of methods.  Such methods may comprise L2 (Layer 2) protocols such as ARP (Address Resolution
Protocol); PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol); LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol).  The methods may also comprise IP protocols (such as ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol); IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol); or GRE (Generic Routing
Encapsulation).  Other possibilities may comprise analyzing any of the following information: a) TCP or UDP ports (such as HTTP, Telnet, FTP); b) the application layer header of the application to be identified; c) Packet data content; or d) Packets and
traffic behavior.
<br/><br/> The application classifier application process 410 involves saving the application classifier for the specific connection in the end user device 402 that originated the traffic 406 in a flow table in the associated router (126 or 112 in FIG. 1)
for the associated subnetwork (106 or 110 in FIG. 1).  Alternatively, the application classifier may be stored in a memory in the end user device 402, such as storage 904 as shown in FIG. 9.  However, the application classifier may also be stored in any
memory which is accessible to network devices in network 100.
<br/><br/> Router 104 then receives additional traffic 412, also referred to as additional packets 412, from the same connection on the same end user device as traffic 406.  This traffic 412 may comprise either compressed traffic as in the first
embodiment, or encrypted traffic as in the second embodiment.  In both the first and second embodiments, the router then performs an application classifier application process 414 on the additional traffic to apply the same application classifier to
traffic 412 as was assigned to traffic 406.  Router 104 then sends the application classifier information to the network 404.
<br/><br/> Methods 300 or 400 may be executed by a router, such as router 126 or 112 in FIG. 1.  Alternatively, methods 300 or 400 may also be executed by an access device, such as WIFI access point in network 100.  Those skilled in the art will recognize
that any number of devices in network 100 may execute methods 300 or 400 within the spirit and scope of the invention.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a signaling diagram illustrating the signals exchanged between the network devices in network 100 during execution of the method of the first and second embodiments of the invention.  In method 500, a signal comprising a new
application trigger 508 is sent from the end user device 502 to the router 504 to indicate a suspected change in application based on changed L7 application data.
<br/><br/> Once router 504 receives the new application trigger 508, the router 504 executes two processes: an altered application classifier determination process 510 and an application classifier application process 512.  The altered application
classifier determination process 510 involves the same processes as the application classifier determination process 408, but for the input of altered application data instead of the application data which is input in the 408 process.  The application
classifier application process 512 involves the same processes as the application classifier application process 410 in FIG. 4, which comprises saving the application classifier for the specific connection in the end user device 502 that originated the
traffic 508.
<br/><br/> The end user device 502 then sends additional traffic (packets) from connection A 514, wherein this traffic comprises uncompressed traffic in the first embodiment and unencrypted traffic in the second embodiment.  This additional traffic 514 is
associated with the same application identifier which resulted from the altered application classifier determination process 510.  To do so, the router 504 executes the application classification application process 516 to save the application identifier
in connection A for the additional packets.  The router 504 then sends the application classifier information 518 to the network 506.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating the application management method of the third embodiment of the invention.  The third embodiment may be embodied in any network device which is able to access compressed traffic (via compression interfaces)
from end user devices.  For example, and without limitation, the third embodiment may be embodied in the application recognition module 104, as referenced below in the description of method 600 for exemplary purposes only.  Those skilled in the art will
appreciate that the application recognition module 104 may comprise any number of forms within the spirit and scope of the invention.  For exemplary purposes only, the application recognition module may comprise a stand-alone computer device, or a
computer device which includes spread functionality among multiple locations in network 100.
<br/><br/> Method 600 begins with step 602 when compressed traffic is detected at a first connection.  This step 602 may be a passive or active step depending on the configuration of the application recognition module 104.  In a passive embodiment, the
application recognition module 104 would receive a notification (for example, from an end user device 148-162, or routers 126 or 112) that compressed traffic is present on communication channel 108.  In an active embodiment, the application recognition
module 104 would be configured to actively snoop or monitor communication channel 108 until compressed traffic is detected.
<br/><br/> At step 604, method 600 executes an application classifier acquisition process.  Instead of trying to analyze the compressed traffic to determine the application classifier, at this step the application recognition module 104 will access the
connection of the network device that originated the compressed traffic to acquire the application classifier associated with the compressed traffic.
<br/><br/> At step 606, method 600 executes an application management process, which utilizes the application classifier stored for the connection as input.  This process may include any number of processes depending on the configuration of the application
recognition module 104, and business needs.  For example, the application management process may comprise applying quality of service metrics on traffic associated with a particular application identifier.  Another example of an application management
process may include a reporting function to generate a report for one or more criteria relating to the specific application represented by the application identifier.  Those skilled in the art will appreciate that numerous processes involving analysis of
applications, and performance of applications, in a network could be included in the application management process within the spirit and scope of the invention.
<br/><br/> At step 608, method 600 provides application management process output.  This output will vary depending on the type of application management process is utilized.  If the application management process is a reporting function, then the output
at step 608 may include one or more reports in any number of formats (spreadsheet, .jpg, .pdf files, etc.) If quality of service metrics are applied, the output would comprise resulting data resulting from the QoS metric application.  Another example of
an application management process comprises performance metrics such as delay, wherein jitter could be calculated and presented as output.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating the application management process of the fourth embodiment of the invention.  Method 700 is similar to method 600, but for the detection of unencrypted traffic at step 702 versus the detection of
uncompressed traffic at step 602.  The steps 702-708 are as described for steps 602-608, except that unencrypted traffic and encrypted interfaces are involved instead of uncompressed traffic and compressed interfaces, respectively.  The encrypted
interfaces comprise any network connection including encryption software 907 as described below in FIG. 9.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 is a signaling diagram illustrating the signals exchanged between network devices during execution of the application management method of the third and fourth embodiments of the invention.  The first connection 802 sends traffic 808 to
the application recognition module (ARM) 804.  As discussed above, the third and fourth embodiments may be embodied in a number of network devices in network 100, but for exemplary purposes only, the third and fourth embodiments are described from the
perspective of the application recognition module.
<br/><br/> Traffic signal 808 may comprise uncompressed traffic in the case of the third embodiment, and unencrypted traffic in the case of the fourth embodiment.  The traffic signal 808 may not be a direct signal to the ARM 804, but rather, may comprise
the traffic 808 being sent to a common communication channel, such as bus 108, which the ARM 804 also has access (as described above in the passive and active embodiments).
<br/><br/> Once ARM 804 receives traffic 808, the ARM 804 performs two processes: an application classifier acquisition process 810 and an application management process 812.  As described above, the application classifier acquisition process 810 comprises
the ARM 804 accessing the connection of the network device that originated the compressed traffic to acquire the application classifier associated with the compressed traffic.  As also described above, the application management process 812 may comprise
any number of processes depending on the configuration of the application recognition module 804, and business needs.  At the conclusion of the application management process 812, the ARM 804 sends application management process output 814 to network
806.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a block diagram illustrating a network device configured to operate as described herein for identifying and managing applications over compressed or encrypted traffic in a network.  This network device 900 may include, without
limitation, an end user device such as 148-162 in FIG. 1.  Network device 900 includes communication interface 901, processing system 902, and user interface 903.  Processing system 902 includes storage system 904.  Storage system 904 stores software
configured to perform the methods described herein, as well as compression software 905, flow table 906, and encryption software 907.
<br/><br/> Processing system 902 is linked to communication interface 901 and user interface 903, and may be configured to execute any of the methods described herein.  In addition to an end user device, network device 900 could include a programmed
general-purpose computer, although those skilled in the art will appreciate that programmable or special purpose circuitry and equipment may be used.  Network device 900 may be distributed among multiple devices that together make up elements 901-907.
<br/><br/> Communication interface 901 could include a network interface, modem, port, transceiver, or some other communication device.  Communication interface 901 may be distributed among multiple communication devices.  Processing system 902 could
include a computer microprocessor, logic circuit, or some other processing device.  Processing system 902 may be distributed among multiple processing devices.  User interface 903 could include a keyboard, mouse, voice recognition interface, microphone
and speakers, graphical display, touch screen, or some other type of user device.  User interface 903 may be distributed among multiple user devices.  Storage system 904 could include a disk, tape, integrated circuit, server, or some other memory device. Storage system 904 may be distributed among multiple memory devices.
<br/><br/> Processing system 902 retrieves and executes compression software 905 and encryption software 907 from storage system 904.  Compression software 905 and encryption software 907 may include an operating system, utilities, drivers, networking
software, and other software typically loaded onto a computer system.  Compression software 905 and encryption software 907 could include an application program, firmware, or some other form of machine-readable processing instructions.  When executed by
processing system 902, Compression software 905 and encryption software 907 directs processing system 902 to operate as described herein to classify and manage applications over compressed or encrypted traffic in a network.  It is important to note that
computer device 900 is not required to have both compression software 905 and encryption software 907.  Thus, a computer device 900 operating some of the methods of the invention may very well comprise, or have access to, either compression software 905
or encryption software 907, but not both.
<br/><br/> The various embodiments of the invention offer many advantages over the prior art.  If networking devices can identify the specific application that originated an individual packet or flow when the traffic is uncompressed, and pass that
information along to the compressed side of the network, then AVC modules will be able to perform reporting, quality of services, statistical, and other management functions with heightened accuracy.  Likewise, providing this ability to classify and
manage applications over encrypted traffic will also provide similar benefits.  The embodiments of the invention also result in a more efficient system as the invention alleviates the need for behavioral or statistical mechanisms to identify applications
in the network.
