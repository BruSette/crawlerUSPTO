<br/><br/> 1.  Field
<br/><br/> Example embodiments relate to images, such as screenshots.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of the Related Art
<br/><br/> Images such as screenshots, also known as screen dumps, screen captures, or screen grabs, are used in various manners to capture visible items displayed on a visual output device, such as a monitor or television.  Visible items can include any
item displayed on a visual output device, for example, such items can include a displayed webpage or a displayed component of a webpage.
<br/><br/> Screenshot technology, typically implemented through software, hardware, or a combination thereof, can be found on various electronic devices and operating systems.  This versatility allows for exploiting screenshot technology for all sorts of
computerized functions.  For example, a screenshot can be taken of a displayed component of a webpage and then that screenshot can be further processed or even converted into another format.  For example, a screenshot could be taken of a displayed
webpage and then that screenshot is converted into a Flash object.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> A system for converting formatting of display object, including logic (e.g., a computing device) that can be operable to traverse and record a part of source code or binary data related to a first visible item displayed on a visual output
device.  The logic can then convert a first data type or data structure that includes the recorded part of source code or binary data to a second data type or data structure that still includes the recorded part of source code or binary data, where the
second data type or data structure is related to a second visible item displayable on the visual output device.
<br/><br/> Also, the logic can render the second visible item for display on the visual output device, wherein the second visible item comprises interactivity, appearance, and position similar to the first visible item.  Both the first visible item and the
second visible item may be part of a website.  Furthermore, the first data type or data structure may be formatted for a web browser, and the second data type or data structure may be formatted for a Flash Player. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE
DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> The system and method may be better understood with reference to the following drawings and description.  Non-limiting and non-exhaustive embodiments are described with reference to the following drawings.  The components in the drawings are not

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> As mentioned above, a screenshot can be taken of a displayed part of a webpage and then that screenshot can be further processed or even converted into another format.  For example, a screenshot could be taken of a displayed webpage and then
that screenshot is converted into a Flash object, where a Flash object may be an object of class of an object-oriented programming language supported by Adobe Flash, or an a visual object rendered by an Adobe Flash Player.  Although various additions and
changes can be made to the screenshot, e.g., change colors of parts, edit text, add animations and links, such additions and changes can require programming or manual editing of the screenshot.  For example, a screenshot of part of a webpage, where the
part has hyperlinks or dynamic components, can be converted into a suitable format for insertion onto another webpage; however, that converted screenshot remains a static image until a programmer adds hyperlinks or dynamic components to the image, e.g.,
adding the hyperlinks or dynamic components to the image through mapping.  Therefore, it is of great interest to develop a system that at least enables some automated additions and changes to an image of a part of a webpage, especially additions of
hyperlinks or dynamic components to the image that already existed on the webpage.
<br/><br/> Described herein is a system that can perform such functionality (hereinafter referred to as the dynamic screenshot system or the DSS) by way of a method.  Such a method can include traversing and recording a source code or binary data related
to a first visible item displayed on a visual output device (e.g., traversing and recording source code of a part of a webpage).  The method can also include converting a first data type or data structure that includes the recorded source code or binary
data to a second data type or data structure that still includes the recorded source code or binary data (e.g., converting a first data structure that includes code corresponding to HTML source code to a second data structure, where the second data
structure includes the same HTML source included in the first data structure).  Further, the method can include generating a second source code or binary data from the second data type.  Also, the method can include displaying on the visual output device
a second visible item that at least has similar interactivity, appearance, and position as the first visible item.  For example, the method can generate an image, such as a screenshot, but instead of generating a static image, the method can generate a
dynamic image where components of the image are not static.
<br/><br/> For example, the dynamic image can allow a user to zoom in on a particular item of the image or find out more information about the particular item, e.g., by hovering a mouse over the item or clicking on an icon for the item.  The dynamic image
can also allow a user to browse a multiple level item, e.g., a multiple level directory item of a directory webpage or part of a webpage.  Further, for example, the dynamic image can facilitate navigating the levels of the multiple level item without
waiting for other components of a graphical user interface to render.  This, for example, can make web browsing faster.  Furthermore, other advantages of the dynamic image, the aforementioned method for deriving the dynamic image, and the DSS will become
apparent from the detailed description below.
<br/><br/> Subject matter will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and which show, by way of illustration, specific example embodiments.  Subject matter may, however, be embodied in
a variety of different forms and, therefore, covered or claimed subject matter is intended to be construed as not being limited to any example embodiments set forth herein; example embodiments are provided merely to be illustrative.  Likewise, a
reasonably broad scope for claimed or covered subject matter is intended.  Among other things, for example, subject matter may be embodied as methods, devices, components, or systems.  Accordingly, embodiments may, for example, take the form of hardware,
software, firmware or any combination thereof (other than software per se).  The following detailed description is, therefore, not intended to be taken in a limiting sense.
<br/><br/> Throughout the specification and claims, terms may have nuanced meanings suggested or implied in context beyond an explicitly stated meaning.  Likewise, the phrase "in one embodiment" as used herein does not necessarily refer to the same
embodiment and the phrase "in another embodiment" as used herein does not necessarily refer to a different embodiment.  It is intended, for example, that claimed subject matter include combinations of example embodiments in whole or in part.
<br/><br/> The terminology used in the specification is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of example embodiments of the invention.  In general, terminology may be understood at least in part from
usage in context.  For example, terms, such as "and", "or", or "and/or," as used herein may include a variety of meanings that may depend at least in part upon the context in which such terms are used.  Typically, "or" if used to associate a list, such
as A, B or C, is intended to mean A, B, and C, here used in the inclusive sense, as well as A, B or C, here used in the exclusive sense.  In addition, the term "one or more" as used herein, depending at least in part upon context, may be used to describe
any feature, structure, or characteristic in a singular sense or may be used to describe combinations of features, structures or characteristics in a plural sense.  Similarly, terms, such as "a," "an," or "the," again, may be understood to convey a
singular usage or to convey a plural usage, depending at least in part upon context.  In addition, the term "based on" may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an exclusive set of factors and may, instead, allow for existence of additional
factors not necessarily expressly described, again, depending at least in part on context.  FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of a network 100 that can implement one embodiment of the DSS.
<br/><br/> Likewise, it will be understood that when an element is referred to as being "connected" or "coupled" to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present.  In contrast, when an
element is referred to as being "directly connected" or "directly coupled" to another element, there are no intervening elements present.  Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g.,
"between" versus "directly between", "adjacent" versus "directly adjacent", etc.).
<br/><br/> It will be further understood that the terms "comprises", "comprising,", "includes" and/or "including", when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the
presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof, and in the following description, the same reference numerals denote the same elements.
<br/><br/> Now, in order to more specifically describe example embodiments of the present invention, various embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.  However, the present invention is not
limited to the example embodiments, but may be embodied in various forms.  In addition, the detailed is not intended as an extensive or detailed discussion of known concepts.  As such, details that are known generally to those of ordinary skill in the
relevant art may have been omitted or may be handled in summary fashion.
<br/><br/> While example embodiments have been particularly shown and described with reference to FIGS. 1-7, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the
spirit and scope of example embodiments, as defined by the following claims.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of a network 100 that can implement one embodiment of the DSS.  As shown, FIG. 1, for example, includes a variety of networks, such as local area local area network (LAN)/wide area network
(WAN) 105 and wireless network 110, a variety of devices, such as client device 101 and mobile devices 102-104, and a variety of servers, such as content servers 107-109 and search server 106.
<br/><br/> A network, such as the network 100, may couple devices so that communications may be exchanged, such as between a server and a client device or other types of devices, including between wireless devices coupled via a wireless network, for
example.  A network may also include mass storage, such as network attached storage (NAS), a storage area network (SAN), or other forms of computer or machine readable media, for example.  A network may include the Internet, one or more local area
networks (LANs), one or more wide area networks (WANs), wire-line type connections, wireless type connections, or any combination thereof.  Likewise, sub-networks may employ differing architectures or may be compliant or compatible with differing
protocols, may interoperate within a larger network.  Various types of devices may, for example, be made available to provide an interoperable capability for differing architectures or protocols.  As one illustrative example, a router may provide a link
between otherwise separate and independent LANs.
<br/><br/> A communication link or channel may include, for example, analog telephone lines, such as a twisted wire pair, a coaxial cable, full or fractional digital lines including T1, T2, T3, or T4 type lines, Integrated Services Digital Networks
(ISDNs), Digital Subscriber Lines (DSLs), wireless links including satellite links, or other communication links or channels, such as may be known to those skilled in the art.  Furthermore, a computing device or other related electronic devices may be
remotely coupled to a network, such as via a telephone line or link, for example.
<br/><br/> A wireless network, such as wireless network 110, may couple client devices with a network.  A wireless network may employ stand-alone ad-hoc networks, mesh networks, Wireless LAN (WLAN) networks, cellular networks, or the like.  A wireless
network may further include a system of terminals, gateways, routers, or the like coupled by wireless radio links, or the like, which may move freely, randomly or organize themselves arbitrarily, such that network topology may change, at times even
rapidly.  A wireless network may further employ a plurality of network access technologies, including Long Term Evolution (LTE), WLAN, Wireless Router (WR) mesh, or 2nd, 3rd, or 4th generation (2G, 3G, or 4G) cellular technology, or the like.  Network
access technologies may enable wide area coverage for devices, such as client devices with varying degrees of mobility, for example.
<br/><br/> For example, a network may enable RE or wireless type communication via one or more network access technologies, such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), General Packet Radio
Services (GPRS), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), LTE Advanced, Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), Bluetooth, 802.11b/g/n, or the like.  A wireless network may include virtually any type of wireless
communication mechanism by which signals may be communicated between devices, such as a client device or a computing device, between or within a network, or the like.
<br/><br/> Signal packets communicated via a network, such as a network of participating digital communication networks, may be compatible with or compliant with one or more protocols.  Signaling formats or protocols employed may include, for example,
TCP/IP, UDP, DECnet, NetBEUI, IPX, Appletalk, or the like.  Versions of the Internet Protocol (IP) may include IPv4 or IPv6.
<br/><br/> The Internet refers to a decentralized global network of networks.  The Internet includes local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), wireless networks, or long haul public networks that, for example, allow signal packets to be
communicated between LANs.  Signal packets may be communicated between nodes of a network, such as, for example, to one or more sites employing a local network address.  A signal packet may, for example, be communicated over the Internet from a user site
via an access node coupled to the Internet.  Likewise, a signal packet may be forwarded via network nodes to a target site coupled to the network via a network access node, for example.  A signal packet communicated via the Internet may, for example, be
routed via a path of gateways, servers, etc. that may route the signal packet in accordance with a target address and availability of a network path to the target address.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of an electronic device 200 that can implement an aspect of one embodiment of the DSS.  Instances of the electronic device 200 may include servers, such as servers 106-109 and client devices,
such as client devices 101-104.  In general, the electronic device 200 can include a processor 202, memory 210, a power supply 206, and input/output components, such as network interface(s) 230, an audio interface 232, a display 234, a key pad or
keyboard 236, an input/output interface 240, and a communication bus 204 that connects the aforementioned elements of the electronic device.  The network interfaces 230 can include a receiver and a transmitter (or a transceiver), and an antenna for
wireless communications.  The processor 202 can be one or more of any type of processing device, such as a central processing unit (CPU).  Also, for example, the processor 202 can be central processing logic; central processing logic includes hardware,
firmware, software and/or combinations of each to perform a function(s) or an action(s), and/or to cause a function or action from another component.  Also, based on a desired application or need, central processing logic may include a software
controlled microprocessor, discrete logic such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a programmable/programmed logic device, memory device containing instructions, or the like, or combinational logic embodied in hardware.  Also, logic may
also be fully embodied as software.  The memory 210, which can include RAM 212 or ROM 214, can be enabled by one or more of any type of memory device, such as a primary (directly accessible by the CPU) and/or a secondary (indirectly accessible by the
CPU) storage device (e.g., flash memory, magnetic disk, optical disk).  The RAM can include an operating system 221, data storage 224, applications 222, such as a web browser 225 and an instant messenger 223, and instructions for the DSS.  The ROM can
include BIOS 220 of the electronic device 200.  The power supply 206 contains one or more power components, and facilitates supply and management of power to the electronic device 200.  The input/output components can include any interfaces for
facilitating communication between any components of the electronic device 200, components of external devices (such as components of other devices of the network 100), and end users.  For example, such components can include a network card that is an
integration of a receiver, a transmitter, and one or more I/O interfaces.  A network card, for example, can facilitate wired or wireless communication with other devices of a network.  In cases of wireless communication, an antenna can facilitate such
communication.  Also, the I/O interfaces, can include user interfaces such as monitors, keyboards, touchscreens, microphones, and speakers.  Further, some of the I/O interfaces and the bus 204 can facilitate communication between components of the
electronic device 200, and in one embodiment can ease processing performed by the processor 202.
<br/><br/> In configurations where the electronic device 200 is a client device, it can include a computing device capable of sending or receiving signals, such as via a wired or a wireless network.  A client device may, for example, include a desktop
computer or a portable device, such as a cellular phone telephone, a smart phone, a display pager, a radio frequency (RF) device, an infrared (IR) device, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a handheld computer, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a
set top box, a wearable computer, an integrated device combining various features, such as features of the forgoing devices, or the like.
<br/><br/> Also, a client device may vary in terms of capabilities or features.  Claimed subject matter is intended to cover a wide range of potential variations.  For example, a cell phone embodiment may include a numeric keypad or a display of limited
functionality, such as a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD) for displaying text.  In contrast, however, as another example, a web-enabled client device may include one or more physical or virtual keyboards, mass storage, one or more accelerometers,
one or more gyroscopes, global positioning system (GPS) or other location-identifying type capability, or a display with a high degree of functionality, such as a touch sensitive color two dimensional (2D) or three dimensional (3D) display, for example.
<br/><br/> Further, a client device may include or may execute a variety of operating systems, including a personal computer operating system, such as a Windows, iOS or Linux, or a mobile operating system, such as iOS, Android, or Windows Mobile, or the
like.  A client device may include or may execute a variety of possible applications, such as a client software application enabling communication with other devices, such as communicating one or more messages, such as via email, short message service
(SMS), or multimedia message service (MMS), including via a network, such as a social network, including, for example, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> LinkedIn, Twitter, Flickr, or Google+, to provide only a few possible examples.  A client device may also include or execute
an application to communicate content, such as, for example, textual content, multimedia content, or the like.  A client device may also include or execute an application to perform a variety of possible tasks, such as browsing, searching, playing
various forms of content, including locally stored or streamed video, or games (such as fantasy sports leagues).  The foregoing is provided to illustrate that claimed subject matter is intended to include a wide range of possible features or
capabilities.
<br/><br/> In configurations in which the electronic device 200 is a server, it can include a computing device that is capable of sending or receiving signals, such as via a wired or wireless network, or may be capable of processing or storing signals,
such as in memory as physical memory states, and may, therefore, operate as a server.  Thus, devices capable of operating as a server may include, as examples, dedicated rack-mounted servers, desktop computers, laptop computers, set top boxes, integrated
devices combining various features, such as two or more features of the foregoing devices, or the like.
<br/><br/> Further, a server may vary widely in configuration or capabilities, but generally a server may include one or more central processing units and memory.  A server may also include one or more mass storage devices, one or more power supplies, one
or more wired or wireless network interfaces, one or more input/output interfaces, or one or more operating systems, such as Windows Server, Mac OS X, Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, or the like.
<br/><br/> Particularly, a content server may include a device that includes a configuration to provide content via a network to another device.  A content server may, for example, host a site, such as a social networking site, examples of which may
include, without limitation, Flicker, Twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> LinkedIn, or a personal user site (such as a blog, a video blog, an online dating site, etc.).  A content server may also host a variety of other sites, including, but not limited to business
sites, educational sites, dictionary sites, encyclopedia sites, wikis, financial sites, and government sites.
<br/><br/> Further, a content server may provide a variety of services that include web services, third-party services, audio services, video services, email services, instant messaging (IM) services, SMS services, MMS services, FTP services, voice over IP
(VOIP) services, calendaring services, photo services, or the like.  Examples of content may include text, images, audio, video, or the like, which may be processed in the form of physical signals, such as electrical signals, for example, or may be
stored in memory, as physical states, for example.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of the method performed by the DSS, a method 300, which can also be performed by an electronic device, such as a client device or, in general, the device of FIG. 2.  In one embodiment, a
processor, such as the processor 202 can perform the method 300 by executing processing device readable instructions encoded in the memory 210.  The method 300 begins with traversing a first source code or binary data related to a first visible item
displayed on a visual output device, such as the display 234 (at 302).  In one embodiment, Javascript embedded in HTML can facilitate traversing a Document Object Model (at DOM) of a web page that includes at least the first source code or binary data
related to the first visible item.  In addition, in this embodiment, the web page can include modules that the Javascript can facilitate extracting.  Next, the method 300 continues with recording source code or binary data at one or more parts of the
source code or binary data (at 304).  In one embodiment, predetermined target modules of the webpage, possibly denoted by HTML tags, are selected, and string data of these modules are copied into respective Javascript Objects.  Next, the method 300
continues with converting a first data type or data structure that contains the recorded respective source code or binary data to a second data type or data structure that still contains the recorded source code or binary data (at 306).  In some
embodiments, the conversion at 306 can include one or more of processes 408-424 illustrated in FIG. 4 and mentioned below.  The method 300 then continues with generating a second source code or binary data from the second data type or data structure that
contains the recorded source code or binary data (at 308).  In turn, the method continues, due to executing the second source code or binary data, with displaying, on the visual output device, a second visible item that has similar interactivity,
appearance, and position as the first visible item (at 310).  In some embodiments, the second visible item is rendered by high-level functions of a sub-component of a web browser, such as high-level functions of a Flash Player, that makes requests to
lower level functions that render sections of a bitmap for displaying objects.  From the point of view of an end user, the second visible item appears to be the first visible item; however, after the method 300, the visible item is no longer render by
the same instructions.  Therefore, the second visible item can include all the features of the first visible item combined with additional features, such as Flash animation.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates a flowchart of another embodiment of the method performed by the DSS, a method 400, which is also performed by an electronic device, such a client device or, in general, the device of FIG. 2.  In particular, the method 400 can
be performed by a web browser application, such as web browser 225.  The method 400 starts with requesting content, such as requesting Flash content (at 402).  The method 400 then continues with activating code, such as Javascript embedded in HTML, which
traverses a Document Object Model (at DOM) of a web page that includes the request for content (at 404).  Next, the method 400 continues with extracting, asynchronously, modules (e.g., HTML-based modules) included in the web page (at 406).  For example,
predetermined target modules on the webpage are selected, and string data of these modules are copied into respective Javascript Objects.  In one embodiment, where the web page contains HTML header, body, and footer tags, modules can be selected due to
each module having its own respective header, body, and footer tags.  Next, the method 400 continues with merging the modules' objects into a collective object (at 408).  The method 400 then continues with converting the collective object, which can be a
well-formed object, into a string, such as a Javascript Object Notation string (at 410).  Next, the method 400 continues with passing the string to a sub-component of the browser, such as Flash Player (at 412).  Where the string is passed to a Flash
Player, it can be passed via a FlashVars object.  Then the method 400 continues with loading the sub-component of the browser (at 414), where upon loading the sub-component the string becomes available for processing by the sub-component.  For example,
where upon embedding a Javascript Object Notation String into a Flash object and loading the Flash Player, the Flash Player can process the JavascriptObject Notation String.  Next, the method 400 continues with the sub-component instantiating,
asynchronously, classes that control each of the modules, respectively (at 416).  For example, the Flash Player may asynchronously instantiate classes that handle each module.  Then the method 400 continues with each module independently decoding the
string into a native object of the sub-component (or an object that can interact with the sub-component but is not native to the sub-component) (at 418).  For example, each module then independently decodes the Javascript Object Notation String into a
native Flash Key/Value pair Object.  Each module then traverses the native object and places all assets referenced by the native object into a display object (at 420).  For example, the Flash Key/Value pair Object is loaded, and assets referenced by this
native object are submitted to a Flash display object.  Each display object then is dynamically copied into a collective display object, where each individual display object is referenced with respect to placement according to predetermined criteria and
attributes of the webpage (at 422).  It is from the collective display object that the objects for each module are rendered accordingly on the webpage.  After organization of all of the individual modules (which are eventually positioned on the webpage
similarly to their original placement), the modules are then converted into an array, such as a bitmap.  Then a callback function of the sub-component notifies top-level functions of the web browser or sub-component that all modules have been combined
and are ready for rendering (at 424).  For example, a callback function of the web browser or sub-component notifies embedded Javascript that all assets have been fully downloaded and rendered.  The top-level functions then may in turn make requests to
the lower level functions that can render sections of the array (at 426).  In one embodiment, the return value of the lower level functions can be in the form of a bitmap that can then be added to a display object list that acts as a queue for displaying
objects.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates an example web browser displaying an example webpage that includes a part of or the entire second visible item referenced in FIG. 3 at 310.  Alternatively, the displayed webpage can include one or more of the modules (where
the modules are rendered to the displayed webpage in FIG. 5) referenced in the description of FIG. 4 at 424.  At 424, these modules are associated with a collective display object and renderable by a sub-component of a web browser, such a Flash Player. 
In FIG. 5, the second visible item or the sub-component renderable modules can appear to be duplicative of the first visible item or the modules referenced in FIG. 4 prior to being processed by the method 400, respectively.  However, although the second
visible item or the sub-component renderable modules have similar interactivity, appearance, and position as their respective predecessors, these processed aspects of a webpage can also include added features, such as animation features.  For example,
elements of the second visible item or the sub-component renderable modules can be part of a first frame of an animation, and a Flash Player, for example, can alter the appearance and positioning of these elements via a frame following the first frame
(e.g., see FIG. 6), and can eliminate the appearance of these elements via a final frame (e.g., see FIG. 7).  Further, in one embodiment, the added animation features do not affect the interactivity of components (such as hyperlinks) of the second
visible item or the sub-component renderable modules.  Therefore, HTML modules can be encapsulated by Flash objects that can alter the appearance and position of the HTML modules without necessarily eliminating interactivity of the HTML modules, for
example.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 illustrates the example web browser of FIG. 5 displaying an example webpage that includes either the second visible item resulting from the method 300 or the sub-component renderable modules resulting from the method 400.  However, in
FIG. 6, the second visible item or the sub-component renderable modules have a different appearance and position, and possibly different interactivity of their predecessors.  These differences are due to added animation features that render an animation. For example, in FIG. 6, the elements of the displayed webpage are part of a frame after the first frame of the animation (See FIG. 5).
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 illustrates another frame of the animation, e.g., a final frame of the animation, rendered by the added animation features.  In FIG. 7, in the frame of the animation, parts of the second visible item or the sub-component renderable
modules are not visible to the user.
