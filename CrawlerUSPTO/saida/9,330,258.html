       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A computer-implemented method for identifying URLs that link to
     potentially malicious resources may include (1) compiling a set of URLs
     that link to at least one potentially malicious resource, (2) identifying
     a common pattern of characters included in the set of URLs that link to
     the potentially malicious resource, (3) deriving a regular expression
     capable of being used to identify additional URLs that link to one or
     more potentially malicious resources based at least in part on the common
     pattern of characters, and then (4) identifying at least one additional
     URL that links to at least one potentially malicious resource by (i)
     applying the regular expression to the additional URL and then (ii)
     determining that the additional URL links to the potentially malicious
     resource based at least in part on applying the regular expression to the
     additional URL. Various other methods, systems, and computer-readable
     media are also disclosed.

       <i>Primary Examiner:</i> Kim; Tae
<br/>
       <i>Attorney, Agent or Firm:</i> <coma>ALG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, LLC
<br/>
         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A computer-implemented method for identifying Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) that link to potentially malicious resources, at least a portion of the method being
performed by a computing device comprising at least one processor, the method comprising: compiling a set of one-time URLs that each facilitate a download of a potentially malicious resource only once in response to a user click performed on a
redirection link included in a search result, wherein compiling the set of one-time URLs comprises: determining that at least one security agent installed on a set of user devices has encountered the potentially malicious resource via the set of one-time
URLs in response to user clicks performed on redirection links included in search results;  identifying each one-time URL at which the security agent installed on the set of user devices has encountered the potentially malicious resource;  compiling the
set of one-time URLs to include each one-time URL at which the security agent has encountered the potentially malicious resource;  identifying a common pattern of characters included in the set of one-time URLs that link to the potentially malicious
resource, the common pattern of characters comprising a plurality of character strings included in each one-time URL within the set of one-time URLs;  deriving, based at least in part on the plurality of character strings included in each one-time URL
within the set of one-time URLs, a regular expression capable of being used to identify additional one-time URLs that each facilitate a download of one or more potentially malicious resources only once;  identifying at least one additional one-time URL
that facilitates a download of at least one potentially malicious resource only once in response to an additional user click performed on an additional redirection link included in an additional search result by: applying the regular expression to the
additional one-time URL;  determining that the additional one-time URL links to the potentially malicious resource based at least in part on applying the regular expression to the additional one-time URL.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: detecting at least one attempt by a user device to access the additional URL that links to the potentially malicious resource;  in response to detecting the attempt to access the additional URL,
blocking the attempt to access the additional URL before the user device encounters the potentially malicious resource via the additional URL.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1, wherein compiling the set of URLs comprises grouping the set of URLs into subsets based at least in part on similarity by: comparing at least one URL in the set of URLs with at least one other URL in the set of URLs; 
determining, based at least in part on the comparison, that the URL and the other URL exceed a threshold level of similarity relative to one another;  in response to determining that the URL and the other URL exceed the threshold level of similarity,
forming a subset of similar URLs that includes the URL and the other URL.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 3, wherein: identifying the common pattern of characters included in the set of URLs comprises identifying the common pattern of characters included in the subset of similar URLs;  deriving the regular expression capable
of being used to identify additional URLs that link to the potentially malicious resource comprises deriving, based at least in part on the common pattern of characters included in the subset of similar URLs, a regular expression capable of being used to
identify additional URLs that link to the potentially malicious resource.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 4, wherein grouping the set of URLs into subsets based at least in part on similarity further comprises: comparing at least one additional URL in the set of URLs with at least one further URL in the set of URLs; 
determining, based at least in part on the comparison, that the additional URL and the further URL exceed a threshold level of similarity relative to one another;  in response to determining that the additional URL and the further URL exceed the
threshold level of similarity, forming another subset of similar URLs that includes the additional URL and the further URL.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 5, wherein: identifying the common pattern of characters included in the set of URLs comprises identifying the common pattern of characters included in the other subset of similar URLs;  deriving the regular expression
capable of being used to identify additional URLs that link to the potentially malicious resource comprises deriving, based at least in part on the common pattern of characters included in the other subset of similar URLs, a regular expression capable of
being used to identify additional URLs that link to the potentially malicious resource.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 1, wherein deriving the regular expression capable of being used to identify additional URLs that link to the potentially malicious resource comprises providing the set of URLs to an expression-derivation tool that
derives the regular expression from the set of URLs.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 1, wherein: the potentially malicious resource comprises a malicious file;  identifying the additional URL that links to the potentially malicious resource comprises identifying a URL that facilitates downloading the
malicious file;  further comprising: detecting at least one attempt by a user device to access the URL that facilitates downloading the malicious file;  in response to detecting the attempt to access the URL, blocking the attempt to access the URL before
the user device downloads the malicious file via the URL.
<br/><br/> 9.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: testing the regular expression against one or more non-malicious URLs;  upon testing the regular expression against the non-malicious URLs, determining that the test of the regular expression

<br/><br/> Malicious programmers may distribute malicious resources (such as malware) in a variety of ways.  For example, a malicious programmer may use a malware propagation kit (such as BLACKHOLE or REDKIT) to infect a website and distribute malware to
users that visit the infected website.  Additionally or alternatively, the malicious programmer may pay the owner of the website to host and distribute the malware from his or her website.
<br/><br/> The malicious programmer may also modify the website such that the malware is downloadable only by users that accesses a specific redirection link.  For example, an unsuspecting user may click on a specific GOOGLE search result or <b><i>FACEBOOK</i></b> post
that redirects the user to a "one-time" Uniform Resource Locator (URL).  This "one-time" URL may trigger a download of the malware from the website only once.  Unfortunately, while the user may unknowingly download the malware from the website upon
clicking the GOOGLE search result or <b><i>FACEBOOK</i></b> post, malware analysts may have difficulty reproducing the same infection for diagnostic purposes since the URL that triggers the download is "one-time" only.
<br/><br/> As such, the instant disclosure identifies and addresses a need for improved systems and methods for identifying URLs that link to potentially malicious resources.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> As will be described in greater detail below, the instant disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for identifying URLs that link to potentially malicious resources by deriving one or more regular expressions from a set of
known-malicious URLs and then applying these regular expressions to one or more additional URLs encountered by a computing device.
<br/><br/> In one example, a computer-implemented method for identifying URLs that link to potentially malicious resources may include (1) compiling a set of URLs that link to at least one potentially malicious resource, (2) identifying a common pattern of
characters included in the set of URLs that link to the potentially malicious resource, (3) deriving a regular expression capable of being used to identify additional URLs that link to one or more potentially malicious resources based at least in part on
the common pattern of characters included in the set of URLs, and then (4) identifying at least one additional URL that links to at least one potentially malicious resource by (i) applying the regular expression to the additional URL and then (ii)
determining that the additional URL links to the potentially malicious resource based at least in part on applying the regular expression to the additional URL.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the method may also include detecting at least one attempt by a user device to access the additional URL that links to the potentially malicious resource.  In such examples, the method may further include blocking the attempt
to access the additional URL before the user device encounters the potentially malicious resource via the additional URL.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the method may also include determining that at least one security agent installed on a set of user devices has encountered the potentially malicious resource.  In such examples, the method may further include identifying each
URL at which the security agent installed on the set of user devices has encountered the potentially malicious resource.  Additionally or alternatively, the method may include compiling a set of URLs that includes each URL at which the security agent has
encountered the potentially malicious resource.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the method may also include grouping the set of URLs into subsets based at least in part on similarity.  For examples, the method may include comparing at least one URL in the set of URLs with at least one other URL in the set
of URLs.  In this example, the method may further include determining that the URL and the other URL exceed a threshold level of similarity relative to one another based at least in part on the comparison.  Additionally or alternatively, the method may
include forming a subset of similar URLs that includes the URL and the other URL in response to determining that the URL and the other URL exceed the threshold level of similarity.
<br/><br/> In one example, the method may also include identifying the common pattern of characters included in the subset of similar URLs.  In this example, the method may further include deriving a regular expression capable of being used to identify
additional URLs that link to the potentially malicious resource based at least in part on the common pattern of characters included in the subset of similar URLs.
<br/><br/> In one example, the method may also include comparing at least one additional URL in the set of URLs with at least one further URL in the set of URLs.  In this example, the method may further include determining that the additional URL and the
further URL exceed a threshold level of similarity relative to one another based at least in part on the comparison.  Additionally or alternatively, the method may include forming another subset of similar URLs that includes the additional URL and the
further URL in response to determining that the additional URL and the further URL exceed the threshold level of similarity.
<br/><br/> In one example, the method may also include identifying the common pattern of characters included in the other subset of similar URLs.  In this example, the method may further include deriving a regular expression capable of being used to
identify additional URLs that link to the potentially malicious resource based at least in part on the common pattern of characters included in the other subset of similar URLs.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the method may also include providing the set of URLs to an expression-derivation tool that derives the regular expression from the set of URLs.  Additionally or alternatively, the method may include identifying a URL that
facilitates downloading a malicious file.  The method may further include detecting at least one attempt by a user device to access the URL that facilitates downloading the malicious file.  Finally, the method may include blocking the attempt to access
the URL in response to detecting the attempt to access the URL.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the method may also include testing the regular expression against one or more non-malicious URLs.  In such examples, the method may further include determining that the test of the regular expression resulted in at least one
false positive.  Additionally or alternatively, the method may include discarding the regular expression to avoid false positives resulting from the regular expression in response to determining that the test of the regular expression resulted in the
false positive.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the method may also include calculating an amount of false positives that resulted from the test of the regular expression.  In such examples, the method may further include determining that the amount of false positives
exceeds a predetermined threshold.  Additionally or alternatively, the method may include refraining from applying the regular expression to additional URLs due at least in part to the amount of false positives that resulted from the test of the regular
expression.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the method may also include applying the regular expression at a network layer of a user device.  Additionally or alternatively, the method may include applying the regular expression at a network gateway.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a system for implementing the above-described method may include (1) a compilation module that compiles a set of URLs that link to at least one potentially malicious resource, (2) an expression module that (i) identifies a
common pattern of characters included in the set of URLs that link to the potentially malicious resource and then (ii) derives a regular expression capable of being used to identify additional URLs that link to one or more potentially malicious resources
based at least in part on the common pattern of characters included in the set of URLs, and (3) a security module that identifies at least one additional URL that links to at least one potentially malicious resource by (i) applying the regular expression
to the additional URL and then (ii) determining that the additional URL links to the potentially malicious resource based at least in part on applying the regular expression to the additional URL.  The system may also include at least one processor
configured to execute the compilation module, the expression module, and the security module.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the above-described method may be encoded as computer-readable instructions on a computer-readable-storage medium.  For example, a computer-readable-storage medium may include one or more computer-executable instructions that,
when executed by at least one processor of a computing device, may cause the computing device to (1) compile a set of URLs that link to at least one potentially malicious resource, (2) identify a common pattern of characters included in the set of URLs
that link to the potentially malicious resource, (3) derive a regular expression capable of being used to identify additional URLs that link to one or more potentially malicious resources based at least in part on the common pattern of characters
included in the set of URLs, and then (4) identify at least one additional URL that links to at least one potentially malicious resource by (i) applying the regular expression to the additional URL and then (ii) determining that the additional URL links
to the potentially malicious resource based at least in part on applying the regular expression to the additional URL.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> The present disclosure is generally directed to systems and methods for identifying URLs that link to potentially malicious resources.  As will be explained in greater detail below, by identifying a common pattern of characters included in a set
of known-malicious URLs, the various systems and methods described herein may derive a regular expression capable of being used to identify other malicious URLs that include the common pattern of characters.  Upon deriving this regular expression, the
various systems and methods described herein may identify a "one-time" URL that links to at least one potentially malicious resource by applying the regular expression to this "one-time" URL before any users have triggered a download of the potentially
malicious resource from the "one-time" URL.  As a result, the various systems and methods described herein may be able to block users' inadvertent attempts to access the malicious "one-time" URL and thus prevent such users from downloading the
potentially malicious resource.
<br/><br/> The following will provide, with reference to FIGS. 1-2, detailed descriptions of exemplary systems for identifying URLs that link to potentially malicious resources.  Detailed descriptions of corresponding computer-implemented methods will be
provided in connection with FIG. 3.  Detailed descriptions of exemplary sets of URLs, subsets of similar URLs, regular expressions, and potentially malicious URLs will be provided in connection with FIGS. 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively.  In addition,
detailed descriptions of an exemplary computing system and network architecture capable of implementing one or more of the embodiments described herein will be provided in connection with FIGS. 8 and 9, respectively.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary system 100 for identifying URLs that link to potentially malicious resources.  As illustrated in this figure, exemplary system 100 may include one or more modules 102 for performing one or more tasks. 
For example, and as will be explained in greater detail below, exemplary system 100 may include a compilation module 104 that compiles a set of URLs that link to at least one potentially malicious resource.  Exemplary system 100 may also include
expression module 106 that (1) identifies a common pattern of characters included in the set of URLs that link to the potentially malicious resource and then (2) derives a regular expression capable of being used to identify additional URLs that link to
one or more potentially malicious resources based at least in part on the common pattern of characters included in the set of URLs.
<br/><br/> In addition, and as will be described in greater detail below, exemplary system 100 may include a security module 108 that identifies at least one additional URL that links to at least one potentially malicious resource by (1) applying the
regular expression to the additional URL and then (2) determining that the additional URL links to the potentially malicious resource based at least in part on applying the regular expression to the additional URL.  Exemplary system 100 may further
include testing module 110 that (1) tests the regular expression against one or more non-malicious URLs, (2) determines that the test of the regular expression resulted in at least one false positive, and then (3) discards the regular expression to avoid
false positives resulting from the regular expression in response to determining that the test of the regular expression resulted in the false positive.  Although illustrated as separate elements, one or more of modules 102 in FIG. 1 may represent
portions of a single module or application (such as SYMANTEC'S NORTON ANTIVIRUS, SYMANTEC'S NETWORK SECURITY, SYMANTEC'S NORTON INTERNET SECURITY, MCAFEE ALL ACCESS, MCAFEE TOTAL PROTECTION, MCAFEE INTERNET SECURITY, F-SECURE ANTI-VIRUS, TITANIUM
ANTIVIRUS+SECURITY, and/or KASPERSKY ANTI-VIRUS).
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, one or more of modules 102 in FIG. 1 may represent one or more software applications or programs that, when executed by a computing device, may cause the computing device to perform one or more tasks.  For example, and as
will be described in greater detail below, one or more of modules 102 may represent software modules stored and configured to run on one or more computing devices, such as the devices illustrated in FIG. 2 (e.g., computing devices 202(1)-(N), security
server 206, and/or web server 208), computing system 810 in FIG. 8, and/or portions of exemplary network architecture 900 in FIG. 9.  One or more of modules 102 in FIG. 1 may also represent all or portions of one or more special-purpose computers
configured to perform one or more tasks.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 1, exemplary system 100 may also include one or more sets of URLs, such as set of URLs 120.  The term "URL," as used herein, generally refers to any type or form of character string that identifies, references, and/or
links to at least one resource (such as an Internet resource).  The term "resource," as used herein, generally refers to any type or form of physical or virtual component within a computing environment (such as a computing device and/or the Internet).
<br/><br/> In some examples, set of URLs 120 may link to at least one potentially malicious resource.  The phrase "malicious resource," as used herein, generally refers to any type or form of resource intended and/or configured to infiltrate a user's
computing device without the informed consent of the user.  In one example, each URL in set of URLs 120 may link to the same potentially malicious resource.  In another example, while some URLs in set of URLS 120 may link to one potentially malicious
resource, other URLs in set of URLs 120 may link to another potentially malicious resource.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 1, exemplary system 100 may also include one or more regular expressions, such as regular expression 124.  The phrase "regular expression," as used herein, generally refers to any type or form of search pattern used to
identify URLs that satisfy certain criteria.  Examples of regular expression 124 include, without limitation, rules, heuristics, policies, sequences of characters, search patterns, algorithms, combinations of one or more of the same, or any other
suitable expression used to identify URLs that satisfy certain criteria.  In one example, regular expression 124 may include a search pattern used to identify at least one URL whose sequence of characters is similar in one way or another to set of URLs
120.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 1, exemplary system 100 may also include at least one additional URL, such as URL 126.  In one example, URL 126 may link to at least one potentially malicious resource.  In this example, URL 126 may be subjected to a
security analysis based at least in part on regular expression 124.  Upon completion, this security analysis may yield information indicating that URL 126 links to the potentially malicious resource.
<br/><br/> Exemplary system 100 in FIG. 1 may be implemented in a variety of ways.  For example, all or a portion of exemplary system 100 may represent portions of exemplary system 200 in FIG. 2.  As shown in FIG. 2, system 200 may include a network 204
that facilitates communication among computing devices 202(1)-(N), a security server 206, and/or a web server 208.  In one example, computing devices 202(1)-(N) may be programmed with one or more of modules 102.  Additionally or alternatively, computing
devices 202(1)-(N) may include regular expression 124 and/or URL 126.
<br/><br/> In one example, security server 206 may be programmed with one or more of modules 102.  Additionally or alternatively, security server 206 may include set of URLs 120, regular expression 124, and/or URL 126.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 2, web server 208 may include a potentially malicious resource 210.  Examples of potentially malicious resource 210 include, without limitation, malware, computer viruses, computer worms, Trojan horses, spyware, adware,
rootkits, files that potentially include one or more of the same, URLs that potentially link to one or more of the same, combinations of one or more of the same, or any other potentially malicious resource.  In one example, potentially malicious resource
210 may be linked by and/or accessible via URL 126.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, one or more of modules 102 from FIG. 1 may, when executed by at least one processor of computing devices 202(1)-(N) and/or security server 206, enable one or more of computing devices 202(1)-(N) and/or security server 206 to
identify URLs that link to potentially malicious resources.  For example, and as will be described in greater detail below, one or more of modules 102 may cause one or more of computing devices 202(1)-(N) and/or security server 206 to (1) compile set of
URLs 120 that link to at least one potentially malicious resource, (2) identify a common pattern of characters included in set of URLs 120, (3) derive regular expression 124 capable of being used to identify additional URLs that link to one or more
potentially malicious resources based at least in part on the common pattern of characters included in set of URLs 120, and then (4) identify URL 126 as linking to at least one potentially malicious resource by (i) applying regular expression 124 to URL
126 and then (ii) determining that URL 126 links to the potentially malicious resource based at least in part on applying regular expression 124 to URL 126.
<br/><br/> Computing devices 202(1)-(N) generally represents any type or form of computing device capable of reading computer-executable instructions.  Examples of computing devices 202(1)-(N) include, without limitation, laptops, tablets, desktops,
servers, cellular phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), multimedia players, embedded systems, user devices, combinations of one or more of the same, exemplary computing system 810 in FIG. 8, or any other suitable computing devices.
<br/><br/> Security server 206 generally represents any type or form of computing device capable of deriving, applying, and/or distributing regular expressions.  Examples of security server 206 include, without limitation, application servers, web servers,
storage servers, and/or database servers configured to run certain software applications and/or provide various security, web, storage, and/or database services.
<br/><br/> Web server 208 generally represents any type or form of computing device capable of hosting and/or distributing potentially malicious resources.  Examples of web server 208 include, without limitation, application servers, storage servers,
backup servers, replication servers, deduplication servers and/or database servers configured to run certain software applications and/or provide various web, storage, backup, replication, deduplication and/or database services.
<br/><br/> Network 204 generally represents any medium or architecture capable of facilitating communication or data transfer.  Examples of network 204 include, without limitation, an intranet, a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Local Area Network (LAN), a
Personal Area Network (PAN), the Internet, Power Line Communications (PLC), a cellular network (e.g., a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network), exemplary network architecture 900 in FIG. 9, or the like.  Network 204 may facilitate
communication or data transfer using wireless or wired connections.  In one embodiment, network 204 may facilitate communication among computing devices 202(1)-(N), security server 206, and/or web server 208.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an exemplary computer-implemented method 300 for identifying URLs that link to potentially malicious resources.  The steps shown in FIG. 3 may be performed by any suitable computer-executable code and/or computing
system.  In some embodiments, the steps shown in FIG. 3 may be performed by one or more of the components of system 100 in FIG. 1, system 200 in FIG. 2, computing system 810 in FIG. 8, and/or portions of exemplary network architecture 900 in FIG. 9.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 3, at step 302 one or more of the systems described herein may compile a set of URLs that link to at least one potentially malicious resource.  For example, compilation module 104 may, as part of one or more of computing
devices 202(1)-(N) and/or security server 206 in FIG. 2, compile set of URLs 120 that link to at least one potentially malicious resource.  In one example, set of URLs 120 may collectively link to a plurality of different malware-infected files.  In
another example, each URL in set of URLs 120 may link to the same malware-infected file.
<br/><br/> The systems described herein may perform step 302 in a variety of ways.  In some examples, compilation module 104 may query one or more security agents (not illustrated in FIG. 2) for any URLs that link to one or more known-malicious files.  For
example, compilation module 104 may, as part of server 206 in FIG. 2, query one or more security agents installed on computing devices 202(1)-(N) for any URLs that have triggered a download of known-malicious file "maliciousexample.exe".  In response to
the query, the security agents installed on computing devices 202(1)-(N) may search their corresponding download logs for any URLs that triggered a download of the "maliciousexample.exe" file.
<br/><br/> During the search of their download logs, a plurality of the security agents installed on computing devices 202(1)-(N) may identify a URL that triggered a download of the "maliciousexample.exe" file.  These security agents may then provide each
URL that triggered a download of "maliciousexample.exe" to security server 206 via network 204.  As security server 206 receives these URLs from the security agents, compilation module 104 may compile set of URLs 120 based at least in part on these URLs
received from the security agents.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the security agents installed on computing devices 202(1)-(N) may be configured to report any URLs that triggered a download of a known-malicious file.  For example, a plurality of the security agents installed on computing
devices 202(1)-(N) may detect a download of the "maliciousexample.exe" file.  In this example, these security agents may search their corresponding download logs for the URL that triggered the download of the "maliciousexample.exe" file.
<br/><br/> During the search of their download logs, these security agents may identify the URL that triggered the download of the "maliciousexample.exe" file on their corresponding computing devices.  These security agents may then provide each URL that
triggered a download of the "maliciousexample.exe" file to security server 206 via network 204.  As security server 206 receives these URLs from the security agents, compilation module 104 may compile set of URLs 120 based at least in part on these URLs
received from the security agents.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 4, set of URLs 120 may include various URLs that link to at least one potentially malicious resource (in this example, "http://findfreemediaonline.com/files/7e799757b9854ba457493470d2055b3cdow-

<br/><br/> In one example, each URL in set of URLs 120 in FIG. 4 may have triggered a download of the same potentially malicious resource.  For example, the "http://4beaf.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2022_brs2.exe" URL may have triggered a download of the
"maliciousexample.exe" file on one of computing devices 202(1)-(N).  Additionally or alternatively, the "http://0005d.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2013_brs8.exe" URL may have triggered a download of the "maliciousexample.exe" file on another one of
computing devices 202(1)-(N).  Accordingly, set of URLs 120 may include a single instance of each URL known to have triggered a download of the "maliciousexample.exe" file on a computing device within computing devices 202(1)-(N).
<br/><br/> In another example, set of URLs 120 in FIG. 4 may have collectively triggered downloads of different potentially malicious resources.  For example, the "http://4beaf.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2022_brs2.exe" URL may have triggered a download
of known-malicious file "malware.exe" on one of computing devices 202(1)-(N).  Additionally or alternatively, the "http://0005d.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2013_brs8.exe" URL may have triggered a download of known-malicious file "virus.exe" on another
one of computing devices 202(1)-(N).  Accordingly, set of URLs 120 may include a single instance of various malicious URLs encountered by one or more of computing devices 202(1)-(N).
<br/><br/> In some examples, compilation module 104 may group and/or cluster set of URLs 120 into subsets based at least in part on similarity.  In one example, compilation module 104 may compare set of URLs 120 with one another.  For example, compilation
module 104 may compare the "http://4beaf.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2022_brs2.exe" URL with the "http://0005d.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2013_brs8.exe" URL.  Compilation module 104 may then determine that the
"http://4beaf.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2022_brs2.exe" URL and the "http://0005d.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2013_brs8.exe" URL exceed a threshold level of similarity relative to one another based at least in part on this comparison.  In response to
determining that the "http://4beaf.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2022_brs2.exe" URL and the "http://0005d.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2013_brs8.exe" URL exceed the threshold level of similarity, compilation module 104 may form a subset of similar URLs
that includes these URLs.
<br/><br/> In one example, compilation module 104 may use one or more string metrics to perform this comparison on set of URLs 120.  The phrase "string metric," as used herein, generally refers to any type or form of metric that measures similarity and/or
dissimilarity among a set of strings (such as set of URLs 120).  Examples of these string metrics include, without limitation, rules, heuristics, policies, character comparisons, pattern comparisons, Bonnacci distances, Demerau-Levenshtein distances,
edit distances, Euclidean distances, Hamming distances, inversion algorithms, Jaccard indexes, Jaro-Winkler distances, Lee distances, Levenshtein distances, overlap coefficients, Sorensen-Dice coefficients, string kernels, string-to-string correction
problems, Tversky indexes, Wagner-Fischer algorithms, variations of one or more of the same, combinations of one or more of the same, or any other suitable string metrics.
<br/><br/> In response to determining that other URLs in set of URLs 120 exceed the threshold level of similarity relative to one another, compilation module 104 may form other subsets of similar URLs that includes these other URLs.  For example, and as
illustrated in FIG. 5, subset of similar URLs 500 may include a plurality of URLs from set of URLs 120 (in this example, "http://findfreemediaonline.com/files/7e799757b9854ba457493470d2-

<br/><br/> Similarly, and as illustrated in FIG. 5, subset of similar URLs 502 may include a plurality of URLs from set of URLs 120 (in this example, "http://a.cloudfiftyfive.com/NCIC/20121204074753494E434647493032_d0e451a4-
-3f8f-4b17-85b7-dbb0f48ff54f%5C201212040906584737f5-0681-4da8-bb54-ee86c94- 70c2e/Setup.exe," "http://a.spikeyspikeweed.com/NCIC/20120609132753494E434647493032_a2a2fcc- 7-f7d5-47ff-9236-d904d66a54e3/2012060917184e7c25fd-20e8-4dc4-bcbf-a65f6e15-
f8d4/Setup.exe," and so on).
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 3, at step 304 one or more of the systems described herein may identify a common pattern of characters included in the set of URLs that link to the potentially malicious resource.  For example, expression module 106 may,
as part of one or more of computing devices 202(1)-(N) and/or security server 206 in FIG. 2, identify a common pattern of characters included in set of URLs 120.  In one example, this common pattern of characters may include one or more similar or
identical character strings identified in set of URLs 120.  Additionally or alternatively, this common pattern of characters may include one or more generic patterns of characters included in set of URLs 120.
<br/><br/> The systems described herein may perform step 304 in a variety of ways.  In some examples, expression module 106 may search set of URLs 120 for a plurality of URLs that include one or more similar or identical character strings.  For example,
expression module 106 may identify the "http://4beaf.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2022_brs2.exe" URL in set of URLs 120.  Expression module 106 may then search set of URLs 120 for other URLs that include one or more character strings that are similar or
identical to at least a portion of the "http://4beaf.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2022_brs2.exe" URL.
<br/><br/> During the search of set of URLs 120, expression module 106 may identify the "http://0005d.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2013_brs8.exe" URL.  Expression module 106 may then compare the "http://4beaf.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2022_brs2.exe" URL
with the "http://0005d.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2013_brs8.exe" URL.  Upon comparing these URLs, expression module 106 may determine that both of these URLs include common pattern of characters
"http://XXXXX.bablosecures.com/load/secure_20XX_brsX.exe".  The character "X," as used in this example, may represent any type or form of character (such as an alphanumeric character) that varied from one URL to the other.
<br/><br/> In some examples, expression module 106 may direct and/or enable an expression-derivation tool to identify the common pattern of characters included in set of URLs 120.  For example, expression module 106 may provide set of URLs 120 to an
expression-derivation tool accessible via the Internet.  Upon receiving set of URLs 120, the expression-derivation tool may identify the common pattern of characters during the process of deriving a regular expression based at least in part on set of
URLs 120.  Examples of this expression-derivation tool include, without limitation, TEXT2RE, REGEXPAL, REGEXTESTER, REGEXMAGIC, REGEXR, RUBULAR, variations of one or more of the same, combinations of one or more of the same, or any other suitable
expression-derivation tool.
<br/><br/> In some examples, expression module 106 may enable a malware analyst to manually identify the common pattern of characters included in set of URLs 120.  For example, expression module 106 may, as part of security server 206 in FIG. 2, direct
security server 206 to display set of URLs 120 to a malware analyst.  Once the malware analyst has had the opportunity to review set of URLs 120 in the display, the malware analyst may enter user input that identifies the common pattern of characters via
a user interface of security server 206.  Expression module 106 may receive this user input and then identify the common pattern of characters based at least in part on the user input.
<br/><br/> In some examples, expression module 106 may search one or more subsets for a plurality of URLs that include one or more similar or identical character strings.  For example, expression module 106 may identify a URL in subset of similar URLs 500
in FIG. 5.  Expression module 106 may then search subset of similar URLs 500 for other URLs that include one or more character strings that are similar or identical to at least a portion of the identified URL.
<br/><br/> During the search of subset of similar URLs 500, expression module 106 may identify another URL.  Expression module 106 may then compare the URL and the other URL identified in subset of similar URLs 500.  Upon comparing these URLs, expression
module 106 may determine that both of these URLs include characters strings "http://findfreemediaonline.com/files/," "/download.php?get&amp;file_id=gs58ac852ch17i0&amp;advert=149&amp;sub=0&amp;site=206&amp;file- name=fad20out%207%27.zip&amp;name=fade_out_7%27.zip&amp;data=," and
"%3D%3D&amp;ip=110.3.37.74&amp;country=JP".
<br/><br/> In another example, expression module 106 may identify a URL in subset of similar URLs 502 in FIG. 5.  Expression module 106 may then search subset of similar URLs 502 for other URLs that include one or more character strings that are similar or
identical to at least a portion of the identified URL.
<br/><br/> During the search of subset of similar URLs 502, expression module 106 may identify another URL.  Expression module 106 may then compare the URL and the other URL identified in subset of similar URLs 502.  Upon comparing these URLs, expression
module 106 may determine that both of these URLs include characters strings "http://a.," ".com/NCIC/20121204074753494E434647493032_," and "/Setup.exe".  Expression module 106 may also determine that both of these URLs include multiple instances of
generic pattern "-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-".  The character "X," as used in this example, may represent any type or form of character (such as an alphanumeric character) that varied within the generic pattern from one URL to the other.
<br/><br/> The phrase "generic pattern," as used herein, generally refers to any type or form of pattern that includes (1) at least one portion of a character string that is consistent from one URL to another and (2) at least one other portion of the
character string that varies from the one URL to the other.  In one example, the consistent portion of the generic pattern identified in subset of similar URLs 502 includes 4 dashes (in this example, the "-" character) each separated from one another by
4 variable alphanumeric characters.  In this example, the variable portion of the generic pattern identified in subset of similar URLs 502 includes the alphanumeric characters (in this example, the "XXXX" characters) separating each of the 4 dashes from
one another.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the common pattern of characters may be identified in each URL in set of URLs 120.  In other embodiments, the common pattern of characters may be identified in each URL in a subset of similar URLs (such as subset of similar
URLs 500 or subset of similar URLs 502).
<br/><br/> In some examples, expression module 106 may identify a different common pattern of characters for each of the subsets of similar URLs.  For example, expression module 106 may identify "http://findfreemediaonline.com/files/,"
"/download.php?get&amp;file_id=gs58ac852ch17i0&amp;advert=149&amp;sub=0&amp;site=206&amp;file- name=fad20out%207%27.zip&amp;name=fade_out_7%27.zip&amp;data=," and "%3D%3D&amp;ip=110.3.37.74&amp;country=JP" as character strings that are common to each URL in subset of similar URLs 500. 
Additionally or alternatively, expression module 106 may identify "http://a.," ".com/NCIC/20121204074753494E434647493032_," and "/Setup.exe" as character strings that are common to each URL in subset of similar URLs 502 and "-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-" as a
generic pattern that is common to each URL in subset of similar URLs 502.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 3, at step 306 one or more of the systems described herein may derive a regular expression capable of being used to identify additional URLs that link to one or more potentially malicious resources based at least in part
on the common pattern of characters included in the set of URLs.  For example, expression module 106 may, as part of one or more of computing devices 202(1)-(N) and/or security server 206 in FIG. 2, derive regular expression 124 based at least in part on
the common pattern of characters included in set of URLs 120.  In this example, regular expression 124 may facilitate identifying additional URLs that link to one or more potentially malicious resources.
<br/><br/> The systems described herein may perform step 306 in a variety of ways.  In some examples, expression module 106 may extract regular expression 124 from set of URLs 120 such that regular expression 124 represents the common pattern of characters
included in set of URLs 120.  For example, expression module 106 may generate regular expression 124 based at least in part on the "http://4beaf.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2022_brs2.exe" URL and the
"http://0005d.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2013_brs8.exe" URL.  In this example, regular expression 124 may include and/or represent the "http://XXXXX.bablosecures.com/load/secure_20XX_brsX.exe" common pattern of characters identified in both the
"http://4beaf.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2022_brs2.exe" URL and the "http://0005d.bablosecures.com/load/secure_2013_brs8.exe" URL.
<br/><br/> In some examples, expression module 106 may direct and/or enable the expression-derivation tool to extract regular expression 124 from set of URLs 120.  For example, the expression-derivation tool may derive regular expression 124 based at least
in part on the common pattern of characters identified in set of URLs 120.  In this example, regular expression 124 may include and/or represent the common pattern of characters identified in set of URLs 120.
<br/><br/> In some examples, expression module 106 may enable the malware analyst to manually extract regular expression 124 from set of URLs 120.  For example, once the malware analyst has had the opportunity to review set of URLs 120, the malware analyst
may enter user input that directs expression module 106 to generate regular expression 124 based at least in part on the common pattern of characters identified in set of URLs 120.  Expression module 106 may receive this user input and then generate
regular expression 124 in response to the user input.  Regular expression 124 may include and/or represent the common pattern of characters identified in set of URLs 120.
<br/><br/> In some examples, expression module 106 may extract a different regular expression from each of the subsets of similar URLs.  For example, expression module 106 may generate regular expression 600 in FIG. 6 from subset of similar URLs 500.  As
illustrated in FIG. 6, regular expression 600 may include and/or represent a series of character strings (in this example, "http://findfreemediaonline.com/files/," "/download.php?get&amp;file_id=gs58ac852ch17i0&amp;advert=149&amp;sub=0&amp;site=206&amp;file-
name=fad20out%207%27.zip&amp;name=fade_out_7%27.zip&amp;data=," and "%3D%3D&amp;ip=110.3.37.74&amp;country=JP").  Regular expression 600 may facilitate identifying additional URLs that are similar or identical to subset of similar URLs 500.
<br/><br/> In another example, expression module 106 may generate regular expression 602 in FIG. 6 from subset of similar URLs 502.  As illustrated in FIG. 6, regular expression 602 may include and/or represent a series of character strings (in this
example, "http://a.," ".com/NCIC/20121204074753494E434647493032_," and "/Setup.exe") and multiple instances of a generic pattern (in this example, "-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-").  Regular expression 602 may facilitate identifying additional URLs that are similar or
identical to subset of similar URLs 502.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 3, at step 308 one or more of the systems described herein may identify at least one additional URL that links to at least one potentially malicious resource by applying the regular expression to the additional URL.  For
example, security module 108 may, as part of one or more of computing devices 202(1)-(N), network 204, and/or security server 206 in FIG. 2, identify URL 126 that links to potentially malicious resource 210 by applying regular expression 124 to URL 126. 
In one example, potentially malicious resource 210 may represent the same potentially malicious resource linked by and/or accessible via one or more of the URLs in set of URLs 120.  In another example, potentially malicious resource 210 may represent a
different potentially malicious resource that was not linked by and/or accessible via any of the URLs in set of URLs 120.
<br/><br/> The systems described herein may perform step 308 in a variety of ways.  In some examples, security module 108 may detect one or more attempts by computing devices 202(1)-(N) to access URL 126 that links to potentially malicious resource 210. 
For example, security module 108 may, as part of computing device 202(1) in FIG. 2, detect an attempt by the user of computing device 202(1) to access URL 126 via network 204.  Additionally or alternatively, security module 108 may, as part of a network
gateway (not illustrated in FIG. 2) within network 204 in FIG. 2, detect an attempt by the user of computing device 202(1) to access URL 126 via network 204.
<br/><br/> Upon detecting the attempt to access URL 126, security module 108 may apply regular expression 124 to URL 126.  For example, security module 108 may compare regular expression 124 with URL 126.  In this example, security module 108 may use one
or more string metrics to perform this comparison on regular expression 124 and URL 126.
<br/><br/> Security module 108 may determine that URL 126 satisfies a threshold level of criteria of regular expression 124 based at least in part on this comparison.  Security module 108 may then determine that URL 126 links to at least one potentially
malicious resource since URL 126 satisfies the threshold level of criteria of regular expression 124.
<br/><br/> Additionally or alternatively, security module 108 may determine that URL 126 satisfies a threshold level of similarity with respect to regular expression 124 based at least in part on this comparison.  In response, security module 108 may
determine that URL 126 links to at least one potentially malicious resource since URL 126 satisfies the threshold level of similarity with respect to regular expression 124.
<br/><br/> In response to determining that URL 126 links to at least one potentially malicious resource, security module 108 may block the attempt by the user of computing device 202(1) to access URL 126.  Security module 108 may perform this block of the
user's attempt before computing device 202(1) encounters potentially malicious resource 210 hosted by web server 208 via URL 126.
<br/><br/> In one example, security module 108 may detect at least one attempt by at least one of computing devices 202(1)-(N) to access URL 700 in FIG. 7.  As illustrated in FIG. 7, URL 700 may include a character string that links to at least one
resource (in this example, "http://findfreemediaonline.com/files/4d02910397583ae489402874d2984a2c/do- wnload.php? get&amp;file_id=gs58ac852ch17i0&amp;advert=149&amp;sub=0&amp;site=206&amp;filename=fade%20out-
%207%27.zip&amp;name=fade_out_7%27.zip&amp;data=r3MFEUWFpuAio3BOEW2pqVSSm1d4pioNq%- 4PUtklf9PUQqejlq8amlfkklAEMOFs%4Rml5MN%3PsielmzpV%3PwSil9%4MAc%3D%3D&amp;ip=11- 0.3.37.74&amp;country=JP").  In one example, URL 700 may link to potentially malicious resource 210.
<br/><br/> Upon detecting the attempt to access URL 700, security module 108 may apply regular expression 600 to URL 700.  For example, security module 108 may search URL 700 for character strings "http://findfreemediaonline.com/files/,"
"/download.php?get&amp;file_id=gs58ac852ch17i0&amp;advert=149&amp;sub=0&amp;site=206&amp;file- name=fad20out%207%27.zip&amp;name=fade_out_7%27.zip&amp;data=," and "%3D%3D&amp;ip=110.3.37.74&amp;country=JP" identified in regular expression 600.  During this search, security module 108 may
identify each of these character strings in URL 700.  Security module 108 may then determine that URL 700 links to at least one potentially malicious resource since URL 700 includes the character strings identified in regular expression 600.
<br/><br/> In one example, security module 108 may detect at least one attempt by at least one of computing devices 202(1)-(N) to access URL 702 in FIG. 7.  As illustrated in FIG. 7, URL 702 may include a character string that links to at least one
resource (in this example, "http://a.spammyspamfile.com/NCIC/20121204074753494E434647493032_s7a353b2- -7e5e-6c9a-15c8-ead0d57fc61a%7E201212157803657160a1-1085-2af1-ab55-ce73a83- 61a2f/Setup.exe").  In one example, URL 702 may link to potentially
malicious resource 210.
<br/><br/> Upon detecting the attempt to access URL 702, security module 108 may apply regular expression 602 to URL 702.  For example, security module 108 may search URL 702 for character strings "http://a.," ".com/NCIC/20121204074753494E434647493032_,"
and "/Setup.exe" as well as multiple instances of generic pattern "-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-" identified in regular expression 602.  During this search, security module 108 may identify each of these character strings as well as multiple instances of the generic
pattern in URL 700.  Security module 108 may then determine that URL 702 links to at least one potentially malicious resource since URL 702 includes the character strings and multiple instances of the generic pattern identified in regular expression 602.
<br/><br/> Method 300 may also include one or more additional steps (not illustrated in FIG. 3).  In some examples, one or more of the systems described herein may testing the regular expression against one or more non-malicious URLs.  For example, testing
module 110 may, as part of one or more of computing devices 202(1)-(N), network 204, and/or security server 206 in FIG. 2, test regular expression 124 against a set of known non-malicious URLs.  The phrase "non-malicious URL," as used herein, generally
refers to any type or form of character string that identifies, references, and/or links to at least one non-malicious resource.  Upon testing regular expression 124 against the set of known non-malicious URLs, testing module 110 may determine that the
test of regular expression 124 resulted in at least one false positive.
<br/><br/> In one example, testing module 110 may apply regular expression 124 to at least one known non-malicious URL.  For example, testing module 110 may compare regular expression 124 with the known non-malicious URL.  In this example, testing module
110 may determine that the known non-malicious URL satisfies a threshold level of criteria of regular expression 124 based at least in part on this comparison.  Testing module 110 may then determine that this application of regular expression 124
resulted in a false positive since the known non-malicious URL satisfies the threshold level of criteria of regular expression 124.
<br/><br/> In response to determining that this application of regular expression 124 resulted in the false positive, testing module 110 may discard regular expression 124 to avoid false positives resulting from further application of regular expression
124.  In other words, testing module 110 may direct security module 108 to refrain from applying regular expression 124 to additional URLs encountered by computing devices 202(1)-(N) since regular expression 124 yielded the false positive.
<br/><br/> In some examples, testing module 110 may calculate an amount of false positives that resulted from the test of regular expression 124.  For example, testing module 110 may test regular expression 124 against a set of all known non-malicious URLs
and all known-malicious URLs.  The phrase "malicious URL," as used herein, generally refers to any type or form of character string that identifies, references, and/or links to at least one malicious resource.  Upon testing regular expression 124 against
the set of known non-malicious and malicious URLs, testing module 110 may calculate the percentage of false positives that resulted from this test.  Testing module 110 may then determine that this calculated percentage of false positives exceeds a
predetermined threshold.
<br/><br/> In response to determining that this calculated percentage of false positives exceeds the predetermined threshold, testing module 110 may discard regular expression 124 to avoid false positives resulting from further application of regular
expression 124.  In other words, testing module 110 may direct security module 108 to refrain from applying regular expression 124 to additional URLs encountered by computing devices 202(1)-(N) since regular expression 124 yielded a percentage of false
positives that exceeds that the predetermined threshold.
<br/><br/> As explained above in connection with method 300 in FIG. 3, a security technology may fingerprint the characteristics of malicious resources linked by and/or accessible via malicious URLs.  These characteristics of the malicious resources may
enable the security technology to generate one or more regular expressions used to identify additional URLs that link to those same malicious resources and/or other malicious resources accessible via the Internet.
<br/><br/> For example, the security technology may gather a set of known-malicious URLs from security agents installed on various computing devices within a user community.  Upon gathering this set of known-malicious URLs, the security technology may
cluster these known-malicious URLs into smaller groups of URLs that exhibit a similar pattern.  The security technology may then derive and/or extract a different regular expression for each of the smaller groups of similar URLs.
<br/><br/> Upon deriving and/or extracting these regular expressions, the security technology may facilitate applying these regular expressions to the URLs encountered by the computing devices within the user community.  For example, the security
technology may direct the security agents installed on the computing devices to apply these regular expressions to the URLs encountered by the computing devices.  Additionally or alternatively, the security technology may direct a network gateway that
facilitates traffic to the user community to apply these regular expressions to the URLs requested by the computing devices.  By facilitating the application of the regular expressions in these ways, the security technology may provide continuous
protection to the computing devices within the user community and even protect against completely new and/or unknown malware campaigns.

<br/><br/> While the foregoing disclosure sets forth various embodiments using specific block diagrams, flowcharts, and examples, each block diagram component, flowchart step, operation, and/or component described and/or illustrated herein may be
implemented, individually and/or collectively, using a wide range of hardware, software, or firmware (or any combination thereof) configurations.  In addition, any disclosure of components contained within other components should be considered exemplary
in nature since many other architectures can be implemented to achieve the same functionality.
<br/><br/> In some examples, all or a portion of exemplary system 100 in FIG. 1 may represent portions of a cloud-computing or network-based environment.  Cloud-computing environments may provide various services and applications via the Internet.  These
cloud-based services (e.g., software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, etc.) may be accessible through a web browser or other remote interface.  Various functions described herein may be provided through a remote desktop
environment or any other cloud-based computing environment.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, all or a portion of exemplary system 100 in FIG. 1 may facilitate multi-tenancy within a cloud-based computing environment.  In other words, the software modules described herein may configure a computing system (e.g., a
server) to facilitate multi-tenancy for one or more of the functions described herein.  For example, one or more of the software modules described herein may program a server to enable two or more clients (e.g., customers) to share an application that is
running on the server.  A server programmed in this manner may share an application, operating system, processing system, and/or storage system among multiple customers (i.e., tenants).  One or more of the modules described herein may also partition data
and/or configuration information of a multi-tenant application for each customer such that one customer cannot access data and/or configuration information of another customer.
<br/><br/> According to various embodiments, all or a portion of exemplary system 100 in FIG. 1 may be implemented within a virtual environment.  For example, the modules and/or data described herein may reside and/or execute within a virtual machine.  As
used herein, the phrase "virtual machine" generally refers to any operating system environment that is abstracted from computing hardware by a virtual machine manager (e.g., a hypervisor).  Additionally or alternatively, the modules and/or data described
herein may reside and/or execute within a virtualization layer.  As used herein, the phrase "virtualization layer" generally refers to any data layer and/or application layer that overlays and/or is abstracted from an operating system environment.  A
virtualization layer may be managed by a software virtualization solution (e.g., a file system filter) that presents the virtualization layer as though it were part of an underlying base operating system.  For example, a software virtualization solution
may redirect calls that are initially directed to locations within a base file system and/or registry to locations within a virtualization layer.
<br/><br/> In some examples, all or a portion of exemplary system 100 in FIG. 1 may represent portions of a mobile computing environment.  Mobile computing environments may be implemented by a wide range of mobile computing devices, including mobile
phones, tablet computers, e-book readers, personal digital assistants, wearable computing devices (e.g., computing devices with a head-mounted display, smartwatches, etc.), and the like.  In some examples, mobile computing environments may have one or
more distinct features, including, for example, reliance on battery power, presenting only one foreground application at any given time, remote management features, touchscreen features, location and movement data (e.g., provided by Global Positioning
Systems, gyroscopes, accelerometers, etc.), restricted platforms that restrict modifications to system-level configurations and/or that limit the ability of third-party software to inspect the behavior of other applications, controls to restrict the
installation of applications (e.g., to only originate from approved application stores), etc. Various functions described herein may be provided for a mobile computing environment and/or may interact with a mobile computing environment.
<br/><br/> In addition, all or a portion of exemplary system 100 in FIG. 1 may represent portions of, interact with, consume data produced by, and/or produce data consumed by one or more systems for information management.  As used herein, the phrase
"information management" may refer to the protection, organization, and/or storage of data.  Examples of systems for information management may include, without limitation, storage systems, backup systems, archival systems, replication systems, high
availability systems, data search systems, virtualization systems, and the like.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, all or a portion of exemplary system 100 in FIG. 1 may represent portions of, produce data protected by, and/or communicate with one or more systems for information security.  As used herein, the phrase "information
security" may refer to the control of access to protected data.  Examples of systems for information security may include, without limitation, systems providing managed security services, data loss prevention systems, identity authentication systems,
access control systems, encryption systems, policy compliance systems, intrusion detection and prevention systems, electronic discovery systems, and the like.
<br/><br/> According to some examples, all or a portion of exemplary system 100 in FIG. 1 may represent portions of, communicate with, and/or receive protection from one or more systems for endpoint security.  As used herein, the phrase "endpoint security"
may refer to the protection of endpoint systems from unauthorized and/or illegitimate use, access, and/or control.  Examples of systems for endpoint protection may include, without limitation, anti-malware systems, user authentication systems, encryption
systems, privacy systems, spam-filtering services, and the like.
<br/><br/> The process parameters and sequence of steps described and/or illustrated herein are given by way of example only and can be varied as desired.  For example, while the steps illustrated and/or described herein may be shown or discussed in a
particular order, these steps do not necessarily need to be performed in the order illustrated or discussed.  The various exemplary methods described and/or illustrated herein may also omit one or more of the steps described or illustrated herein or
include additional steps in addition to those disclosed.
<br/><br/> While various embodiments have been described and/or illustrated herein in the context of fully functional computing systems, one or more of these exemplary embodiments may be distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, regardless of
the particular type of computer-readable-storage media used to actually carry out the distribution.  The embodiments disclosed herein may also be implemented using software modules that perform certain tasks.  These software modules may include script,
batch, or other executable files that may be stored on a computer-readable storage medium or in a computing system.  In some embodiments, these software modules may configure a computing system to perform one or more of the exemplary embodiments
disclosed herein.
<br/><br/> In addition, one or more of the modules described herein may transform data, physical devices, and/or representations of physical devices from one form to another.  For example, one or more of the modules recited herein may receive a set of
malicious URLs to be transformed, transform the set of malicious URLs, output a result of the transformation to identify a common pattern of characters included in the set of malicious URLs, use the result of the transformation to derive a regular
expression based at least in part on the common pattern of characters, and store the result of the transformation to facilitate identifying additional malicious URLs.  Additionally or alternatively, one or more of the modules recited herein may transform
a processor, volatile memory, non-volatile memory, and/or any other portion of a physical computing device from one form to another by executing on the computing device, storing data on the computing device, and/or otherwise interacting with the
computing device.
<br/><br/> The preceding description has been provided to enable others skilled in the art to best utilize various aspects of the exemplary embodiments disclosed herein.  This exemplary description is not intended to be exhaustive or to be limited to any
precise form disclosed.  Many modifications and variations are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the instant disclosure.  The embodiments disclosed herein should be considered in all respects illustrative and not restrictive. 
Reference should be made to the appended claims and their equivalents in determining the scope of the instant disclosure.
