<br/><br/> Streaming media is multimedia that is constantly received by and presented to an end-user while being delivered by a streaming provider.  The name refers to the delivery method of the medium rather than to the medium itself.  The distinction is
usually applied to media that are distributed over telecommunications networks, as most other delivery systems are either inherently streaming (e.g., radio, television) or inherently non-streaming (e.g., books, video cassettes, audio CDs).  The verb `to
stream` is also derived from this term, meaning to deliver media in this manner.  Internet television is a commonly streamed medium.
<br/><br/> Live streaming, more specifically, means taking the media and broadcasting it live over the Internet.  The process involves a camera for the media, an encoder to digitize the content, a media publisher where the streams are made available to
potential end-users and a content delivery network to distribute and deliver the content.  The media can then be viewed by end-users live.
<br/><br/> Consciousness is variously defined as subjective experience, awareness, the ability to experience "feeling," wakefulness, the understanding of the concept "self," or the executive control system of the mind.  It is an umbrella term that may
refer to a variety of mental phenomena.  Although humans realize what everyday experiences are, consciousness itself resists being defined, philosophers note.
<br/><br/> Consciousness is the subject of much research in philosophy of mind, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science and artificial intelligence.  Issues of practical concern include how the presence of consciousness can be assessed in severely ill
or comatose people; whether non-human consciousness exists and if so how it can be measured; at what point in fetal development consciousness begins; and whether computers can achieve a conscious state.
<br/><br/> Prayer is a form of religious practice that seeks to activate a volitional rapport to a god or spirit through deliberate practice.  Prayer may be either individual or communal and take place in public or in private.
<br/><br/> It may involve the use of words or song.  When language is used, prayer may take the form of a hymn, incantation, formal creedal statement, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person.  There are different forms of prayer such as
petitionary prayers, prayers of supplication, thanksgiving, and worship/praise.
<br/><br/> Prayer may be directed towards a deity, spirit, deceased person, or lofty idea, for the purpose of worshipping, requesting guidance, requesting assistance, confessing sins or to express one's thoughts and emotions.  Thus, people pray for many
reasons such as personal benefit or for the sake of others.
<br/><br/> Most major religions involve prayer in one way or another.  Some ritualize the act of prayer, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach that prayer may be practiced
spontaneously by anyone at any time.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> In one embodiment according to the present invention, a system and process for coordinating a programmed media stream is provided.  Preferably, this content relates to consciousness messages such as prayers, requests for charity, thoughts or
similar messages.  However, this content can also relate to breaking news, music videos, comedy or similar content.  A network-connected server maintains a database containing media content-related data, such as the text of a message, accompanying media,
time of airing, payment and related comments.  A user can view these feeds or streams of these streams by downloading a mobile application or browsing to a website.  The application or website can also be used to create, schedule and pay for media
content airtime for a message or program. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/> Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.  This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth
herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.  The terminology used in the detailed description of the embodiments
illustrated in the accompanying drawings is not intended to be limiting of the invention.  In the drawings, like numbers refer to like elements.
<br/><br/> Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.  It will be further understood that
terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless
expressly so defined herein.
<br/><br/> The terms message, media message or program are used interchangeably in this specification and generally refer to text, audio, video or still images sent across the internet.  In one aspect of the present invention, the system can be used for
any media content type, such as news, comedy, drama, environmental messages, offers to purchase related items, and similar messages.  In another aspect of the present invention, the system is used for consciousness messages, such as prayers, collective
thoughts, appeals to charity and inspirational messages.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example media coordination system 100 according to the present invention which allows network connected devices, such as mobile devices 106 (cell phones, portable music players, tables, laptops, etc.), to coordinate times
for specific media messages/programs to be streamed to other application users (e.g., a feed of message posts or a stream of real-time media data).  Generally, a computer server 102 (e.g., a processor, RAM, a hard drive, an operating system, web serving
software and database software) is connected to a wide area network 104 such as the internet or wireless cell phone data network.  Mobile devices 106 are also connected to the network 104, allowing for communication to and from the server 102.
<br/><br/> As seen in item 220 of the flow chart of FIG. 13, a user either executes the mobile media application on their mobile device or uses a browser to browse to an internet page supplied by the server 102.  The application downloads the current media
message/program (i.e., a thought or prayer video scheduled for airing at that time) from the server.  Alternately, the server 102 may automatically push the current media message or link to the current media message via phone notifications, email or text
messages.
<br/><br/> In one example, delivery of the current media message to the mobile device 106 is performed as a feed that is downloaded as requested by the user.  In another example, delivery of the current media message is achieved with a live streaming media
file (e.g., streaming audio/video) that provides images, text and/or audio to the user's mobile device.  In this respect, the media message stream is similar to a live television station having scheduled media messages as its programming.
<br/><br/> In item 222, the mobile application displays the media message data supplied by the server 102.  This data may include the text of a media message, an attached or linked-to media file, donation information and media message expiration
information (i.e., when the current media message expires causing the mobile application to download a new current media message).  Alternately, the media message data may be a live media stream, previously rendered by the server 102, which displays the
images, text, audio, video or other items in a common media format (e.g., h.264 mp4 video format).  In one preferred embodiment, the media message is a prayer, collective consciousness message, request for charity, environmental or similar message.
<br/><br/> In item 224, the user views the media message data in an interface of the mobile application and interacts with the interface.  For example, the user may add a comment about the media message, a donation, a greeting card or share a link to the
media message via a social network, email, text message or similar communication.  The user may also make purchases within the application (e.g., in app purchases, credit cards, Pay Pal, etc.) to buy gift certificates for message air time, greeting
cards, or similar in application items.
<br/><br/> In item 226, the user can design, upload and pay for a custom media message that is stored and aired from the server 102.  The server will similarly air the custom media message at the specified time as the current media message, thereby
distributing that media message out to other users of the mobile application and website.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 illustrates a flow chart of an example process for coordinating media messages.  As seen in item 190, the mobile application is executed on the mobile device 106 that can download available times that a media message can be scheduled.  A
user can request availability of a specific time or the mobile application can download a variety of free times.
<br/><br/> In item 192, the user selects a time that they would like to have their media message available, the text of their media message, any images or videos that they would like to accompany the media message, and payment information.  This data is
uploaded to server 102 and stored in a database in item 194.
<br/><br/> As seen in item 196, the sever 102 provides media message data according to the scheduled time.  This data can be rendered and streamed as a live streaming format, made available for download to each mobile device 106 running the application or
can be sent out via a push notification, email or text message.  Optionally, the push notification, email or text message can include a link that opens the mobile media message application to that specific media message or to a webpage displaying that
media message.
<br/><br/> The current media message can also be displayed on any participating websites.  For example, an otherwise nonaffiliated website could include code that displays the current media message.  In another example, the media message can be posted to a
social media site, such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or Twitter, which allows users to subscribe.  In this respect, people visiting websites otherwise unrelated to the server 102 can also view the current media message.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 2-9 illustrate various example aspects and interfaces of the mobile media message application according to the present invention.  FIG. 2 illustrates the current media message interface 110 that displays the media message currently
scheduled by the server 102.  The current media message interface 110 preferably includes a media message text display 114 that displays the text of the media message specified by person who created the current media message.
<br/><br/> Optionally, the current media message interface includes an advertisement banner 112 for displaying advertisements from a downloaded source, such as from Google AdSense or Apple in app advertising.  Optionally, the mobile media message
application can allow a user the option to include this banner 112 during the media message creation process to financially subsidize the price of posting the media message.
<br/><br/> The interface 110 also includes a comments button 111 that displays a comment interface for leaving messages related to the current media message.  A past media messages button 113 is also include for displaying a list of past media messages or
bookmarked media messages.
<br/><br/> Preferably, multiple feeds or streams are available to the mobile application.  For example, some streams can be specific breaking news, religion, music, or pets.  Selecting the switch stream button 115 allows the user to switch between these
streams.
<br/><br/> The donate button 117 allows the user to donate money to originator of the media message, thereby allowing users or entities to raise money in addition to soliciting media messages.  The buy gift button 119 allows the user to buy items for the
author of the current message or another user.  Gifts can include virtual greeting cards, gift certificates, message air time, and similar items.  The buy air time button 120 displays an interface for creating and purchasing a media message that will be
displayed on the application and the learn more button 118 displays an about us interface 122 seen in FIG. 3.
<br/><br/> The about us interface 122 preferably includes information about the developer and information 124 about how to pray.  A share button 128 allows the user to share specific media message tips with others (e.g., by emailing text of the media
message information 124).  The go back button 126 returns the user to the previous screen.
<br/><br/> If the user selects the buy airtime button 120 in interface 110, the buy airtime interface 130 is displayed, as seen in FIG. 4.  Title input 132 allows a user to enter a text title for their media message, while text of the media message can be
entered in message input 134.  Optionally, the user can attach or add a link to an image, audio and/or video in the media input 136.  This media is uploaded to the server 102 and rendered in to the stream for broadcast at the scheduled time.  The next
button 138 displays the airtime selection interface 140 as seen in FIG. 5.
<br/><br/> The airtime selection interface 140 preferably provides a plurality of selectable time ranges 142 (e.g., check boxes) and their accompanying cost.  A minute input 144 allows the user to specify the amount of time the user would like their media
message to be displayed as the current media message.  Selecting the advanced button 148 displays the advanced airtime interface 150 seen in FIG. 6.
<br/><br/> The advanced airtime interface 150 allows the user more control over exactly when the media message will be shown as the current media message.  For example, a date interface 152 allows the user to specify a specific day to air the media
message, the time interface 154 provides more detailed time ranges, and the time interface allows input of the amount of time the media message will air as the current media message.  Selecting the basic button 159 returns the user to the airtime
selection interface 140 while selecting the find time button 158 attempts to find an unreserved free time for the media message.
<br/><br/> Once the server 102 has found a free time according to the criteria selected by the user, the preview interface 160 is displayed, as seen in FIG. 7.  The proposed message date 162 is located at the top of the interface 160, followed by the
preview of the media message 164.  The user can select the go back button 166 to return to a previous interface to correct information or can select the checkout button 168 to display the payment interface 170, seen in FIG. 8.
<br/><br/> The payment interface 170 allows the user to select their desired method of payment.  This interface can be used for buying air time on a stream or for any other activity that may require payment (e.g., purchasing gift certificates or greeting
cards).
<br/><br/> For example, the user can select the in app payment button 172 to cause payment through an "in app" payment system, such as Apple's in app payment system.  The user may also enter their credit card information in the credit card input 174 or can
select the Paypal button 176 to bring up Paypal login credentials for payment via Paypal.  Preferably, the interface 170 includes a plurality of charity inputs 178 (e.g., checkboxes) for specifying donations to specific charities.  The user can return to
previous interfaces via the go back button 177 or can submit the payment information via the purchase button 179.
<br/><br/> Once the payment information has been submitted and confirmed by the server 102, the confirmation interface 180 is displayed, as seen in FIG. 9.  A confirmation message 182 is displayed at the top of the interface 180 to confirm the exact time
the media message will be available.  Additionally, a plurality of media message sharing buttons 184 are displayed to allow the user to easily share details (e.g., date, time, hypertext link) to the media message on various calendar, email, text message
or social media websites.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 illustrates an alternate media message interface 200 according to the present invention.  The interface 200 allows a user or organization to post a media message, media (music, video, image, etc.) and/or request for donations, seen in
the media message display 204.  This airstream media message can be purchased through an interface similar to those previously described in this specification.  Optionally, an advertiser may sponsor such a stream and post their ad banner in the banner
display 202.
<br/><br/> The interface 200 also displays live or regularly updated comments and media messages from users in the live stream display 206.  If a user wishes to comment, add a greeting card (or similar link) or add a message, the add message button 208 can
be selected, prompting the user for a text comments and an optional donation amount.  Alternately, the user can select the donate button 210 to donate money without adding a comment (e.g., utilizing the payment interface 170).  These comments and
donation amounts are transmitted to the server 102, processed, and then displayed in the live stream display 206 for all users to view.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 illustrates a sponsor interface 210 that allows an advertiser or user to sponsor a specific current media message or airstream media message.  A media message selection input 212 downloads and displays from the server 102 a list of media
messages and sponsor prices that are available for sponsorship.  A specific media message can be selected and the sponsor's ad banner can be uploaded to the server 102 by clicking the add banner button 214.  Once the user is satisfied by their selection,
the check out button 168 can be used to pay.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 illustrates an item purchase interface 230 that allows the user to make in app purchases of items via the item selection interface 232.  This allows the user to select a desired item (real or virtual) for purchase, then select the check
out button 168, which leads to the previously described payment interface 170.
<br/><br/> In one specific example, the present invention can be particularly used to facilitate prayer or collective consciousness.  For example, users can purchase air time to display a prayer or collective thought.  In another example, a request for
donations (e.g., from a person or charity) can be uploaded to the stream to allow users to donate money within the mobile application.
<br/><br/> In another specific example, the present invention can be used to purchase airtime and upload ongoing news or informational video.  In this respect, a stream may be directed to eye witness news or similar breaking new.
<br/><br/> In another specific example, a stream can be directed to music videos.  Hence, a user can purchase airtime and upload their own music videos that will stream at a specific time and date.
<br/><br/> In another example, a stream can be directed to short films.  Users can produce their own films, purchase airtime, and then upload the films to air on the channel at a specific time.
<br/><br/> In another example according to the present invention, the server can provide a user or company with their own media stream to control.  In this respect, the other users can post messages on this third party controlled stream, allowing the
stream creator to designate airtime price, which uploads are approved and additional items for purchase.
<br/><br/> Although the invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments and applications, one of ordinary skill in the art, in light of this teaching, can generate additional embodiments and modifications without departing from the spirit
of or exceeding the scope of the claimed invention.  Accordingly, it is to be understood that the drawings and descriptions herein are proffered by way of example to facilitate comprehension of the invention and should not be construed to limit the scope
thereof.
