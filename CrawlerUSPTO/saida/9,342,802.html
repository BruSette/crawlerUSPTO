       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A system of tracking rate of change of social network activity associated
     with a digital object includes a change measurement module in
     communication with at least one social network database and a ranking
     module in communication with the change measurement module. The change
     measurement module measures a change in the level of social network
     activity associated with the digital object based on a first object value
     and a second object value. The first object value is based on a
     measurement of activity associated with the digital object in at least
     one social network at a first time, and the second object value is based
     on a measurement of activity at a second time. The ranking module ranks
     the digital object relative to at least one other digital object based on
     a score derived from a rate of change in social network activity.

processor configured to track a rate of change of the social activity and comprising: a change measurement program operated on the hardware processor in communication with a database of each of the plurality of social networks, the database of each of
the plurality of social networks including data points of different types of interactions and different weights of each interaction, the change measurement program determines (1) a number of times each of the plurality of users have an interaction with
the digital object and associated a weight with each type of interaction on the plurality of social networks at a first time to determine a first weighted value of all interactions at the first time, (2) a number of times each of the plurality of users
have an interaction with the digital object and associated a weight with each type of interaction on the plurality of social networks at a second time to determine a second weighted value of interactions at the second time, and (3) a difference between
the first weighted value and the second weighted value of interactions to determine the rate of change of the first and second weighted interactions of the social activity by the plurality of users, the rate of change indicating an increase, decrease, or
stagnating interest in the digital object over a time period, the time period defined by the first and second times, wherein the change measurement program determines the rate of change of the digital object for each of the plurality of social networks; 
and a ranking program operated on the hardware processor in communication with the change measurement program, the ranking program ranks, based on a score derived from the rate of change, the digital object in comparison with other digital objects.
<br/><br/> 2.  The system according to claim 1, wherein the digital object is an online news story that is associated with a unique identifier, the unique identifier allowing the users to interact with the digital object.
<br/><br/> 3.  The system according to claim 1, wherein the ranking program assigns a weight to each different type of interactions by the plurality of users with the digital object, and determines the score of the digital object based on the rate of
change and based on the weight associated with the interactions.
<br/><br/> 4.  The system according to claim 1, wherein the interactions of the plurality of users include at least one of: mentioning the digital object in a comment by one of the plurality of users of the plurality of social networks, recommending the
digital object by one of the plurality of users in one of the plurality of social networks, sharing the digital object on a page of one of the plurality of users of one of the plurality of social networks, commenting on the digital object by one of the
plurality of users in one of a plurality of social networks.
<br/><br/> 5.  The system according to claim 1, further comprising: a reviewing and recording when the rate of change for the digital object has changed.
<br/><br/> 6.  The system according to claim 1, further comprising: a digital object discovery program, operated on the hardware processor, to identify the digital object after the digital object appears on the Internet.
<br/><br/> 7.  A method for identifying a digital object that is gaining attention social activity by a plurality of users of a plurality of social networks, information of the digital object being published on the social network, the digital object being
accessible by users of the social network by interaction, the method being performed by a hardware processor to track a rate of change of the social activity, the method comprising the steps of accessing a database of each of the plurality of social
networks by a change measurement program operated on the hardware processor, each database including data points of different types of interactions of the plurality of users with the digital object in its social network;  determining by the change
measurement program a number of times each of the plurality of users have interacted with the digital object and associated a weight with each type of interaction on the plurality of social networks at a first time to determine a first weighted value of
all interactions at the first time;  determining by the change measurement program a number of times each of the plurality of users have interacted with the digital object and associated a weight with each type of interaction on the plurality of social
networks at a second time to determine a second weighted value of interactions at the second time;  determining by the change measurement program a difference between the first weighted value and the second weighted value of interactions to determine the
rate of change of the first and second weighted interactions of social activity by the plurality of users, the rate of change indicating an increase, decrease, or stagnating interest in the digital object over a time period, the time period defined by
the first and second times, wherein the change measurement program determines the rate of change of the digital object for each of the plurality of social networks;  and ranking the digital object in comparison with other digital objects by a ranking
program operated on the hardware processor in communication with the change measurement program, based on a score derived from the rate of change of the social activity by the plurality of users of the plurality of social networks.

<br/><br/> This invention relates generally to online social networks.  More particularly, it relates to using information from social networks to create information that may be used to rank or measure interactions with digital content.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> In the discussion of the background that follows, reference is made to certain structures and/or methods.  However, the following references should not be construed as an admission that these structures and/or methods constitute prior art.  The
inventor expressly reserves the right to demonstrate that such structures and/or methods do not qualify as prior art.
<br/><br/> Online social networks permit individuals to share and distribute information, including photographs, news, opinions, and links to websites external to the social network.  These social networks, which include Facebook.com (<b><i>Facebook</i></b>),
MySpace.com (MySpace), Twitter.com (Twitter), and LinkedIn.com (LinkedIn), provide a platform on which many individuals publish or distribute information to one another.
<br/><br/> Social networks facilitate among their members communication associated with events or objects external to the social networks.  Many public figures use Twitter, a micro-blogging platform and social network, to communicate information directly
to followers, interested individuals, the press, and fans.  Many private individuals use <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or LinkedIn to communicate with their friends and associates.  As part of these communications, individuals sometimes share a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
associated with a particular piece of digital content, such as a news story, media content, or web page.
<br/><br/> However, no apparatus, system, or method can provide information regarding a rate of change in activity or a speed of spread on a social network or multiple social networks regarding a particular piece of digital content in the manner of the
present invention.  Additionally, no apparatus, system, or method can rank a piece of digital content against another piece of digital content based on the rate of change of activity or the speed of spread through online social networks.  Accordingly,
there is a need in the art for an apparatus, system, or method that can provide information regarding the rate of change of activity on a social network or social networks regarding a piece of digital content, and in particular, an apparatus, a system,
or a method that can rank this digital content based on the rate of change of such activity.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> An exemplary embodiment provides a system of tracking a rate of change in a level of social network activity associated with a digital object.  The system can include a change measurement module in communication with at least one social network
database and a ranking module in communication with the change measurement module.  The change measurement module can measure a change in the level of social network activity associated with the digital object.  The change in the level of social network
activity can be based on a first object value determined at a first time and a second object value determined at a second time.  The first object value can be based on a measurement of activity associated with the digital object in at least one social
network at the first time, and the second object value can be based on a measurement of activity associated with the digital object in at least one social network at the second time.  The change measurement module can determine a rate of change of social
network activity based on a difference between the first time and the second time.  The ranking module can rank the digital object relative to at least one other digital object based on a score derived from the rate of change in social network activity.
<br/><br/> The system may repeat this process multiple times and may rank a defined set of thousands or millions of digital objects using the rate of change in social network activity relating to each object.  The rate of change may represent the velocity
at which each digital object is spreading through social networks.
<br/><br/> Another exemplary embodiment provides a method of tracking rate of change of social network activity associated with a digital object.  The method can include identifying, by a processor of a computer system, one or more digital object sources;
monitoring, by the processor, the one or more digital object sources; identifying, by the processor, a digital object provided by at least one of the digital object sources; categorizing, by the processor, the digital object; sending, by the processor, a
first query to one or more social networks to determine a first level of activity related to the digital object; recording, by the processor, results of the first query; allowing, by the processor, a period of time to pass; sending, by the processor, a
second query to one or more social networks to determine a second level of activity related to the digital object; determining, by the processor, a change in activity related to the digital object; determining, by the processor, a rate of change in
activity related to the digital object; and assigning, by the processor, a score based on the rate of change in activity.
<br/><br/> Another exemplary embodiment provides a computer system, including a processor connected to a computer-readable memory.  The memory can contain instructions that when enabled by the processor implement a method of tracking rate of change of
social network activity associated with a digital object.  The method can include: identifying one or more digital object sources; monitoring the one or more digital object sources; identifying a digital object provided by at least one of the digital
object sources; categorizing the digital object; sending a first query to one or more social networks to determine a first level of activity related to the digital object; recording results of the first query; allowing a period of time to pass; sending a
second query to one or more social networks to determine a second level of activity related to the digital object; determining a change in activity related to the digital object; determining a rate of change in activity related to the digital object; and
assigning a score based on the rate of change in activity.

employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.
<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Embodiments relate to measuring social network activities and determining a rate of change of social network activities associated with a digital object or a speed of spread associated with a digital object in order to rank the digital object
against other digital objects designated as related by the invention or some external source.  The digital object can include, for example, online news stories, product web pages, or political web pages.  The digital object may be external to the social
network.
<br/><br/> Digital objects that are external to social networks may be assessed and ranked, each according to their type, by a system and a method that can measure and determine the rate of change of activity or the speed of spread associated with the
digital objects in online social networks.  Additionally, a level of social network activity associated with a digital object may be tracked over time, producing data that represents changes in the level of activity associated with the object or the
speed of spread associated with the object.
<br/><br/> By using an embodiment to track the rate of change of social network activity over time, data may be derived or created regarding the digital object.  In one embodiment, digital objects of a particular type (such as online news stories
associated with an individual URL and relating to a particular topic or topics) may be tracked, and values derived for the rates of change of activity associated with the objects in multiple social networks.  In another embodiment, the digital object may
be tracked and values derived for the speed of spread associated with the object.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the appearance or publication of digital objects from particular sources can be monitored.  The digital objects can be in the form of newly created URLs.  The appearance or publication of digital objects can be monitored by a
web crawler, RSS feed, or other forms of detecting digital objects.  The object sources may be pre-identified.  As digital objects are generated by the object sources or identified by monitoring object sources, the objects can be categorized according
to, for example, their type, their subject, or geographic source.  The categorization may be based on data within the digital object, or pre-defined information about the source, such as its location, title, topic area, or relative position within a
website.  For example, when a new URL is discovered, key information about the associated digital object may be extracted, including metadata, any description of the object, its publication time, or other data.  This information may be inserted into a
database for storage.  Then, automated queries can be communicated to social networks including, but not limited to, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> LinkedIn and Twitter, to determine the level of activity relating to the URL associated with the digital object.  The level of
social activity on one or more social networks for each URL may also be stored on a database.  Based on the results of these queries, a score or scores can be assigned to the object.  After a time period has elapsed, similar queries can be sent to the
social networks, to determine an updated level of activity relating to the objects.  Code can be executed, whereby the results of these queries can be compared with the results of previous queries, or the score or scores generated previously can be
compared to an updated value or values relating to the digital object.  This data can be combined with the length of the time periods between the sets of queries to derive a rate of change relating to each object.  Using this information, a score or
scores may be generated representing the rate of change of social network activity associated with the digital object.  When such values are generated for multiple objects of the same type, these objects or representations associated with these objects
may be ranked in accordance with these values or other values derived therefrom.  Code for parsing and displaying the digital objects or the representations of these digital objects in a visually distinguishable and useful manner on a webpage can be
generated.  The objects or representations can be displayed in a manner related to their ranking.  The objects or representations can also be displayed in a manner related to their ranking for particular sources, categories, or other designations.  For
example, the highest ranked objects for particular sources, categories, or other designations may be displayed.  The entire process may be completed by use of code executed by a computer, server, or cloud based array.
<br/><br/> In another construction of the embodiment, the location or preferences of an end user of the system or method may influence its function by indicating a preference for particular digital objects.  The preferences can be based on, for example,
subject matter types, geographic sources, or associations with other digital objects or other social network users.  The system or method may use data on social network activity relating to a digital object from multiple social networks to weight or
blend the data as desired.  The method may also involve using a statistical device or an algorithm to add emphasis to particular objects based on their geographic relationship or other relationship with the end user.  Similarly, this entire process may
be completed by use of code executed by a computer, server, or cloud based array.
<br/><br/> In an alternative construction of the embodiment, the system or method may be used to track the rate of change of social network activity associated with a digital object, and to establish correlations between this rate of change and external
events.
<br/><br/> Referring to the figures, a system 100 can measure changes in a level of social network activity associated with a digital object.  The system 100 can then use the measured changes to calculate a rate of change of social network activity
associated with the digital object.  The calculated rate of change of social network activity associated with the digital object can then be used for purposes, such as, ranking one or more digital objects based on the rate of change of activity
associated with one or more digital objects over a period of time.
<br/><br/> Turning to FIG. 1, the system 100 can include a discovery module 101, one or more digital object sources 102a and 102b, a categorization module 104, a categorization data collector module 103, an object parsing module 120, a change measurement
module 200, and a ranking module 300.  The system 100 can further include a visual representation module 130 and an output module 140.
<br/><br/> The discovery module 101 can find at least one digital object within one or more digital object sources 102a and 102b.  The one or more digital object sources 102a and 102b, which generally can be some form of content producing digital platform,
such as a website, can be first identified, and can then be monitored by the system 100.  The digital object sources 102a and 102b may be identified by an end user of the system 100, an administrator of the system 100, or an automated process within the
system 100, such as a web crawler or a computer program that can browse the world wide web or pre-identified portions of the world wide web to detect and/or index content.  For example, in one construction of the system 100, an administrator or end user
of the system 100 can manually identify sources within one or more websites, can manually categorize the sources, and can use the categorized sources for the system 100.  The source can be, for example, an RSS feed or a particular subsection of a website
where a given category of content is published.  These sources may be used to identify and categorize digital objects.
<br/><br/> After at least one digital object source 102a or 102b is found, the discovery module 101 can monitor at least one digital object source 102a or 102b for new digital objects.  The monitoring process may involve using a web crawler or other
computer program to identify new digital objects within or from the digital object source 102a or 102b, or may rely on published announcements or syndication from the digital object source 102a or 102b.  A software product or service external to the
system 100 described herein may be used for the identification of new digital objects.  For example, in one construction of the system 100, the system 100 can monitor RSS feeds and crawl websites programmed into or pre-selected by an operator of the
system 100.  The digital object may comprise a news story, video, audio file, blog, event, topic, photograph, product website, product webpage, political website, political webpage, music, other media, or any digitally stored object embodied in some form
on the internet, a local network, or some other form of sharing digital data.  A digital object can be identified by, for example, a URL, a hyperlink, or any other unique digital identifier for the digital object on the world wide web.  The discovery
module 101 may be based on a computer, a server, or spread across an array of linked computers or servers.
<br/><br/> When the discovery module 101 finds one or more digital object sources 102a and 102b, the categorization module 104 can categorize the digital objects of the digital object sources 102a and 102b.  The categorization data collector module 103 can
input data related to categorizing to the categorization module 104.  The categorization module 104 may use data inputted by an administrator or end user of the system 100 in order to correctly categorize the digital object.  The data may include
editorial decisions made by the administrator.  For example, the administrator may identify a digital object source 102a or 102b as being located in the United Kingdom ("UK"), and producing or linking to content relating to technology and business.  The
categorization module 104 can automatically categorize any input from this source 102a or 102b as UK, technology, and business.  A single website or digital platform producing digital objects may contain multiple sources.  Alternatively, an object may be
categorized using several other methodologies, including but not limited to: its characteristics, such as metadata containing information that indicates that the object is of a certain type; forms of digital content associated with the digital object
(such as video, audio, image, or other file types); keywords associated with or contained in the digital object; categorization by a third party source, such as an external index that indicates that a digital object is of a certain type, or that objects
associated with a particular digital object source are of a certain type; categorization by system users; categorization by administrators; or categorization by social network users.
<br/><br/> The data used for the categorization process can include, for example, information previously determined and inputted regarding at least one of the digital object sources 102a and 102b, information derived from the one or more digital object
sources 102a and 102b, information stored in the system 100, and information requested from an external source.  Thus, digital objects from one or more digital object sources 102a and 102b can be collected and categorized.
<br/><br/> The object parsing module 120 can gather data from a digital object and parse the data.  The data from the digital object may include, for example, a picture, text, a video file, an audio file, metadata, or some other information.  The data from
the digital object is parsed so that a parsed summary representing the digital object can be provided.  The parsed summary can be a parsed summary file representing the digital object.  For example, when the digital object is a news story containing text
and an image, the parsed summary file or files may contain a headline from the news story; some keywords associated with the story; summary text relating to the story; a thumbnail picture or other rendering of the image associated with the story; the
publication or website or other digital platform where the story may be found; feedback or reactions relating to the story from third parties, system users, or social network users; and ranking or scoring information associated with the popularity or
level of activity associated with the story online.
<br/><br/> The change measurement module 200 can determine a rate of change in social network activity related to a particular digital object.  Social network activity may include any actions within any social network that may be associated with the
digital object.  For example, social network activities can include publishing a URL of a digital object on the social network (such as, "sharing" a story via <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or publishing the digital object into a post on Twitter); recommending a digital
object using tools available through the social network (such as, "liking" or "recommending" via <b><i>Facebook</i></b>); using the social network to comment on or discuss the digital object provided or published by another social network user (such as, making a
comment or otherwise interacting with a link shared by another user on <b><i>Facebook</i></b>); posting or sharing a link to the digital object within the social network (for example, publishing a link on Twitter or sharing a link on <b><i>Facebook</i></b>); commenting on a link to
a digital object shared within the social network (such as a photo or other content published within the social network); using a social network account to comment on or otherwise interact with or engage with the digital object (such as using a <b><i>Facebook</i></b>
or Twitter account to post a comment on a news article or blog post); using the social network account to recommend, approve of, or otherwise promote a digital object; using the social network to publish an opinion, reaction or comment relating to the
digital object; using a social network to distribute or communicate the digital object; interacting socially with a digital object either external or internal to the social network within the network; and any other measurable social network activity that
may be associated with the digital object.  The change measurement module 200 may measure any or all of these actions relating to a social network or to a particular social network account.  The social network can be, for example, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> MySpace,
Twitter, LinkedIn, or any other platform on which many individuals publish or distribute information to one another.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 2, one construction of the change measurement module 200 is shown.  In the construction shown, the change measurement module 200 can include code that can be executed by a processor and that can be used to determine the change
in social network activity.  The change measurement module 200 can be communicatively coupled to one or more social network databases 112a, 112b, and 112c.  The system 100 may communicate with the social network databases 112a, 112b, and 112c via a web
service application programming interface provided by the social network.  For example, the system 100 may communicate with the social graph data provided by <b><i>Facebook</i></b>.  The system 100 can use information from the social network databases 112a, 112b, and
112c to determine an object value 220.  The system 100 may allocate differing weights to data points of different types from different social networks.  For example, in one construction of the system 100, the object value 220 can be based on an
"OverAllScore" that is determined as shown below:
<br/><br/> ##EQU00001##
<br/><br/> As shown above, some social networks can be weighted more than others, and some interactions can be weighted more than other.  For example, the posting of a link on <b><i>Facebook</i></b> may be weighted ten times more than another type of social network
interaction, the mentioning of a link in a Tweet may be weighted five times more than another form of social network interaction, a <b><i>Facebook</i></b> "like" or recommendation may be weighted four times more than another form of interaction, the sharing of a link
on LinkedIn may be weighted fifteen times more than another form of interaction, a <b><i>Facebook</i></b> comment may be weighted two times more than another form of interaction, etc.
<br/><br/> The system 100 can repeatedly measure the values 220 over time, thus determining multiple object values 220a, 220b, 220c, and 220d.  The time period between each measurement may vary.  These time periods may be set by a system administrator or
may result from the length of time associated with the system's processes.  In some instances, the time period can be as short as may be achieved using the amount of computing power contained within the system 100.  A time period may be very short
(seconds) or longer (hours).  The time period may extend to days or lengthier periods for some digital object types or sources.  The time period assigned to some objects can differ depending on the level of activity associated with the objects.  Objects
associated with higher levels of social network activity may be checked more frequently, possibly resulting in shorter periods of measurement.
<br/><br/> However, the time period can also be measured and tracked by the system 100.  For each digital object, the system 100 can then determine the change in social network activity since the previous time the system 100 obtained values 220a, 220b,
220c, and 220d for social network activity, and the length of time that has elapsed between each measurement.  This information may be stored in a digital database or databases, linking each digital object with its associated categories, associated
parsed information (such as text, images, and other information), measurements of social network activity relating to the objects, the timing of these measurements, the differences in time between these measurements, values derived from these
measurements, and comparisons of changes in the values derived from these measurements.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 2, the system 100 can check the change in social network activity over time for a given digital object.  The change in activity may be calculated by determining the level of activity at sequential points in time, such as, t1, t2, t3, and
t4.  A recording of object value can occur between a difference in time or a time period T. The difference in time or the time period T may be calculated based on: T1=t2-t1 T2=t3-t2 T3=t4-t3
<br/><br/> The levels of activity at each time, t1, t2, t3 and t4 can be recorded as object values, 220a, 220b, 220c, and 220d.  For example, at time t1, an object value 220a can be recorded; at time t2, an object value 220b can be recorded; at time t3, an
object value 220c can be recorded; and at time t4, an object value 220d can be recorded.  A difference D between each object value, such as 220a, 220b, 220c, and 220d, can represent the total change in social network activity.  The difference D may be
calculated based on: D1=object value 220b at time t2-object value 220a at time t1 D2=object value 220c at time t3-object value 200b at time t2 D3=object value 220d at time t4-object value 220c at time t3
<br/><br/> Using these values, an object .DELTA.  value, such as 230a, 230b, and 230c, representing the rate of change of activity associated with the digital object, may be derived based on.
<br/><br/> .times..times..DELTA..times..times..times..times..times..times..times..ti- mes..times.  ##EQU00002## .times..times..DELTA..times..times..times..times..times..times..times..ti- mes..times.  ##EQU00002.2##
.times..times..DELTA..times..times..times..times..times..times..times..ti- mes..times.  ##EQU00002.3##
<br/><br/> Where: T1, T2, T3=variable time periods D1, D2, D3=differences in social network activity over each variable time period T1, T2, T3, respectively
<br/><br/> The object .DELTA.  value, such as 230a, 230b, and 230c, can change each time the system 100 gathers new object values including new social network activity measurements for an object.  Hence, the speed of "spread" (or additional social network
activity) of the object may be periodically derived and recorded within the system 100.  The object value data based on object values 220a, 220b, 220c may be either weighted using variables, normalized in relation to other data, or otherwise subjected to
changes before the difference D between each measurement is calculated.  Similarly, the difference D between each measurement may be either weighted using variables, normalized in relation to other data, or otherwise subjected to changes before the rate
of change of activity based on object .DELTA.  values 230a, 230b, 230c is derived.
<br/><br/> Returning to FIG. 1, the system 100 can include the ranking module 300.  The digital objects can be ranked using the object .DELTA.  values, such as 230a, 230b, and 230c, over time generated by measuring the change in social network activity and
other data.  Referring to FIG. 3, a flow chart shows a process of using object .DELTA.  values or rate of change in social network activity to rank objects in accordance with an embodiment.  The ranking may be generated at intervals T, or at other
intervals that depend on the amount of resources available to the discovery module 101, the change measurement module 200, or other modules within the system 100.  In one construction of the ranking module 300, the ranking may be dynamically refreshed
within a category as new .DELTA.  values are gathered for each digital object in the category, and for new digital objects within the category.  The .DELTA.  value for each object can be combined with other variables to provide a score 320 for the
object.  The other variables may include a total time passed since the discovery of the object by the system 100, a time at which measurement of the social activities took place, a time at which the object was created, and other variables.  The variables
may be adjusted to give greater prominence or higher scores to more recently created or discovered objects.  The score for an object may also be adjusted for the object within each category type assigned to it by the categorization module 104.  For
example, within category type A the object may be given a score 320a; within category type B the object may be given a score 320b; and within category type C the object may be given a score 320c.  The scores 320a, 320b, and 320c can be stored with the
rank of each category type A, B, and C.
<br/><br/> Additional information may then be added to these category scores 320a, 320b, and 320c to provide additional weight to the score associated with certain digital objects in relation to the score associated with other digital objects, depending on
the objects' type, geographic source, time of publication, or other data.  Among others, a process of statistical normalization 330 may be used to achieve a weighting between scores.  This allows the system 100 to allocate additional weight to digital
objects from sources 102a or 102b that are geographically closer or are otherwise of interest to the end user of the system 100.  Thus, for example, for end users of the system 100 in the UK accessing online news stories, social network activity
associated with those news stories that are produced in the UK or relate to the UK may be given a higher weighting.  For example, in one construction of the system 100, for an end user in Ireland, a story from the UK can be given a lower weighting than a
story from Ireland.  The process of statistical normalization of scores from sets of data with differing distributions is familiar to any programmer of ordinary skill in the art.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, the score 320 can be determined for each object using data from multiple measurements of social network activity values.  In one embodiment, such multiple values may be used to degrade the score for a digital object over time. 
Score=220a(p)+220b(q)+220c(r)+ .  . . 220n(s) T1+T2+T3+ .  . . Tn
<br/><br/> Where:
<br/><br/> Score=The score used for ranking a given digital object.
<br/><br/> 220a=Social network activity at time t1
<br/><br/> 220b=Social network activity at time t2
<br/><br/> 220c=Social network activity at time t3
<br/><br/> 220n=Social network activity at time to
<br/><br/> s, r, q and p are numbers where s&gt;r&gt;q&gt;p
<br/><br/> T1=t2-t1, T2=t3-t2, T3=t4-t3, Tn=t(n+1)-tn
<br/><br/> A normalized object category score 330a, 330b, and 330c can be applied to each digital object for each category A, B, and C, respectively.  Using the normalized object category score 330a, 330b, and 330c, the objects may be ranked according to
their relative weighted scores to determine a relative ranking 340a, 340b, and 340c.  The relative ranking 340a, 340b, and 340c can then be used to provide a relative ranking 350a, 350b, and 350c.  The relative ranking 350a, 350b, and 350c may then be
used to generate a table, display, or other information to convey the rank of one or more digital objects.  The same object may earn different relative scores in each subject category, represented by the numerals 340a, 340b, and 340c, resulting in
variable rankings, 350a, 350b, and 350c.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 4(a) and 4(b), an exemplary output 30 is shown.  The output 30 can include a plurality of parsed representations of digital objects 32, 34, 36, and 38.  Each of the plurality of these representations 32, 34, 36, and 38 can
include a headline 32a, 34a, 36a, and 38a; a parsed excerpt 32b, 34b, 36b, and 38b from the digital object 32, 34, 36, or 38; a source description 32c, 34c, and 36c for each of representations 32, 34, and 36; and a score 32d, 34d, and 36d for each of the
digital objects 32, 34, and 36 derived from the speed of social activity associated with the object, including a score derived in any of the manners described above.  Digital objects 38 can also have a source description and a score, although the source
description and the score is not shown in FIGS. 4(a) and 4(b).
<br/><br/> A ranking module 300 can produce data 350a, 350b, and 350c that rank or that can otherwise be used to arrange digital objects.  The data 350a, 350b, and 350c can determine relationships between digital objects.  The digital objects and the
relationships between the digital objects may be sent to the visual representation module 130.  The visual representation module 130 can arrange the data into, for example, a visual arrangement that displays both the parsed objects and their ranking.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 5, an exemplary output 40 is shown.  The output 40 can include a "url_score_id" 42 that can indicate the identification of the score in the system 100, a "scoretype" 44 that can indicate a portion that contributes to the score,
a "score_num" 46 that can indicate the value of the score, a "url_id" 48 that can indicate an identification of a digital object in the system 100, and a "score_date" 50 that can indicate the time that the score was calculated.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 6(a) and 6(b), an exemplary output 60 is shown.  The exemplary output 60 can include a "url_id" 62 that can indicate the identification of the digital object in the system 100, a "url_loc" 64 that can indicate the location of
the digital object in the world wide web, a "country" 66 that can indicate the location of the digital object, a "source_ID" 68 that can indicate the source of the object, a "img_loc" 69 that can indicate the location of any images associated with the
digital object, a "headline" 70 that can indicate the headline or other leading description associated with a digital object, a "news_summary" 72 than can provide a summary of the digital object, a "sources" 74 that can indicate the digital object
source, a "sources_link" 76 that can indicate the location of the digital object source on the world wide web, a "url_date_find" 78 that can indicate the time that the digital object was found by the system 100, a "score" 80 that can indicate the score
320, and a "scoreTimestamp" 82 that can indicate the time that the score 320 was calculated by the system 100.
<br/><br/> In turn individual end users of the system 100 may access this information through the output module 140.  The output module 140 can be, but not limited to, a web browser or mobile application.  These end users may be served with parsed data
associated with each digital object.  This data may be arranged in a manner that indicates the rank of each digital object using the rate of change of social network activity associated with the digital object (.DELTA.  values divided by the time periods
between each measurement of social network activity).
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 10, an exemplary output 80 is shown.  The output 80 can include one or more digital objects 82 and 84 and a menu 86 arranged adjacent to the one or more digital objects 82 and 84.  Each digital object 82 and 84 can include a
score 82a or 84a, a count 82b or 84b, a time period 82c or 84c, metadata 82d or 84d, and a source 82e or 84e.  The output 80 may be generated by the visual representation module 130 (shown in FIG. 1) and appear in the output module 140 (shown in FIG. 1). The output 80 may be presented using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) accessed by a user via a web browser or mobile application.  The output 80 shown in FIG. 10 presents data from two digital objects 82 and 84, a news story 82 with the headline "Mitt
Romney Tax Returns Released .  . . " published on the website huffingtonpost.com; and a news story 84 with the headline "Gingrich says he will skip debates .  . . ", published on the website thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com.  For each of these two objects 82
and 84, a numeric score 82a and 84a can be provided.  The numeric score 82a and 84a can be derived from the .DELTA.  in social activity.  A score representing the rates of change or A in social activity can be derived from the numbers of social actions
(for example, as shown in FIG. 10, on <b><i>Facebook</i></b> and Twitter, represented with "f" and "t" counts 82b, 84b, respectively) over recent time period 82c for digital object 82 and time period 84c for digital object 84.  In FIG. 10, the time period 82c for
digital object 82 is 3 hours, and the time period 84c for digital object 84 is 2 hours.  Metadata 82d, 84d associated with the digital objects 82, 84, such as an image, may be presented with the digital object 82, 84.  The source 82e, 84e for the digital
objects 82, 84 may be presented.  As shown in FIG. 10, the source 82e, 84e can be a website.  The user may also apply one or more filters to the digital objects 82, 84 presented.  For example, the user may apply a filter by selecting to view only news
from a particular category.  The application of one or more filters may be accomplished by selecting options via the menu 86, which in turn is populated using data generated by the categorization module 104 (shown in FIG. 1) using data collected by the
categorization data collection module 103 (shown in FIG. 1).
<br/><br/> Embodiments may also be applied to measuring changes over time in the rate of social network activity associated with a digital object or multiple digital objects.  Referring to FIG. 7, a diagram representing a digital object social activity
tracking system 400 in accordance with an embodiment is shown.  The system 400 may monitor changes over time in the rate of social media activity associated with a single digital object.
<br/><br/> The system 400 can include a discovery module 401, a categorization module 404, and a parsing module 420.  The system 400 can also include a change measurement module 200.  The system 400 can repeatedly measure activity relating to the object
from multiple social networks 412a, 412b, and 412c and the time between measurements.  The measured activity and the time between measurements may be used to determine multiple .DELTA.  values associated with the digital object over time.  The measured
activity, the time between measurements, and multiple .DELTA.  values resulting from changes in the activity may be used to generate a visual or other representation in the change in activity with the visual representation module 430 or may be used to
link changes in activity to external events.  For example, the system 400 may be used to show changes in social media activity associated with a particular web page, and how or if the changes in social media activity, such as chatter, is influenced by an
advertisement, endorsement, news event, or other external event.  This may be achieved manually or automatically by monitoring changes in .DELTA.  values to check for correlations with external events.  Such a monitoring may be achieved manually by an
end user or an administrator of the system 400 checking .DELTA.  values before, during, and after an event that might be expected to influence these values.  For example, a mention by a celebrity or public figure of a particular website or product might
cause a larger amount of activity for a given period of time for digital objects such as world wide web pages on that website or associated with that product.  An end user may use the system 400 to check .DELTA.  values before, during, and after the
mention, and may check the rate of change of activity with the object over time.  Alternatively, such links may be monitored by linking the system 400 disclosed herein with an external system that monitors events such as advertisement appearances on
television or radio, keyword monitoring of news events, keyword monitoring of social network activities such as publications on Twitter, or monitoring for other external events such as changes in weather, politics, sporting or news events that might
precipitate increased social network activity associated with particular digital objects.  For example the publication of particular advertisements or broadcasting of publicity at particular times might increase social media activity around digital
objects mentioned in the advertisement.  If so, the system 400 disclosed herein may be used alongside a system that monitors the publication of advertisements to demonstrate which advertisements are associated with the greatest positive .DELTA.  values,
or speed of activity.  Thus, advertisers seeking to generate social network activity may determine that some advertisements, or some publication times, are more effective than others for engendering changes in social network activity.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 8, a method 500 of ranking digital objects is shown.  In step 502, one or more digital object sources can be identified.  The digital object sources can be monitored, step 504.  When a digital object is provided by at least one
of the digital object sources, the digital object can be identified, step 506.  When the digital object is identified, the digital object can be categorized, step 508.  A query to one or more social networks can be sent to determine a level of activity
related to the digital object, step 510.  The results of the query can be reviewed and recorded as Result 1, step 512.  A period of time T may be allowed to elapse, step 514.  After a period of time has elapsed, another query can be sent to one or more
social networks to determine a level of activity related to the digital object, step 516.  Results of the query sent after a period of time has elapsed can be reviewed and recorded as Result 2, step 518.  The difference D between Result 1 and Result 2
may be obtained, step 520.  The difference D may next be divided by the period of time T that passed between the recording of Result 1 and Result 2 to obtain a rate of change of activity A related to the digital object, step 522.  The resulting rate of
change of activity A may be reviewed and recorded by the system, step 524.  The score associated with the digital object may be directly derived from this rate of change of activity.  Steps 510 to 526 may be repeated to offer a continuously updating
score relating to the rate of change of social activity associated with the digital object.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 9, another construction is shown.  The system 600 can identify relationships in .DELTA.  values associated with multiple digital objects.  A discovery module 601 can identify objects from digital object sources 602a, 602b, and
these can be categorized using the categorization module 604 using data inputted from the categorization data collector 603.  The system 600 can include a plurality of change measurement modules 610, 611 that can each measure changes in each digital
object.  Each of the plurality of change measurement modules 610, 611 can be similar to the change measurement module 200 shown in FIG. 2.  Each of the plurality of change measurement modules 610, 611 can obtain A values for each object, referred to as
`Object a` and `Object b` in FIG. 10.  A correlation detection module 630 can identify relationships in .DELTA.  values and changes in .DELTA.  values over time among multiple digital objects.  An administrator or user of the system 600 may set
parameters or sensitivities to identify differing closeness of correlations among categories of digital objects.  The system 600 can further include a visual representation module 640 and an output module 650, which may be similar to the visual
representation module 130 and the output module 140 shown in FIG. 1.  The output module 650 can be an internet browser or a mobile device.
<br/><br/> No other system available to businesses or consumers that either gathers digital objects from multiple sources, be these news stories or other online creative endeavors, appears to measure change in social network activity in the manner of the
embodiments and constructions described herein.  Also, no other system appears to indicate the rate of change of social network activity associated with all of these objects in the manner of the embodiments and constructions described herein. 
Embodiments may be used to rank the level of activity associated with news stories, culture, products, or other non-digital objects with associated digital embodiments.
<br/><br/> With the components and constructions described above, a system and a method can measure changes in the level of social network activity associated with a digital object, and can use this information to calculate the rate of change of such
activity for purposes including ranking digital objects based on their relative popularity over time.  The embodiments and constructions herein may be applied to the ranking of objects using changes in the level of social network activity associated with
the objects.  Embodiments and constructions can normalize the ranking of particular object types or sources for specific users.  Embodiments and constructions herein may also be applied to track changes in the level of social network activity associated
with a digital object over time.
