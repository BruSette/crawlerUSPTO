       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> Systems and methods for providing collaborative energy benchmarking are
     described. Information including background data, energy consumption
     data, temporal data, and/or other information is gathered from multiple
     sources and stored in a central database. Based on the stored
     information, energy benchmarks are created for measuring residential
     energy usage. Energy usage data is displayed to consumers in multiple
     formats, and permits consumers to directly compare their energy usage
     data to other consumers or groups of consumers, in addition to their own
     energy usage. In some embodiments, energy challenge programs encourage
     reduction of energy usage. Through such programs, consumers create and
     present challenges for themselves and/or other consumers, such as to
     reduce energy usage during a given timeframe. The progress of the group
     and individual consumers is displayed during the course of a challenge.

<br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> The present technology relates to systems and methods for assessing energy performance.  More specifically, the present technology relates to the use of energy benchmarks to encourage energy reduction across groups of residential energy
consumers.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Increasing energy usage is a growing concern.  Not only does increasing energy usage strain utility grids, there is increasing public concern over the consumption of natural resources and its effects on the environment.
<br/><br/> Commercial property owners and building managers have access to a variety of benchmark metrics that assist them in understanding the energy usage of their properties and/or buildings.  In addition, these benchmark metrics allow owners and
managers to compare the energy usage of their buildings to that of similar buildings.  However, residential consumers have substantially fewer tools and benchmark data to assist them in understanding their own residential energy usage.  Existing tools
for residential consumers have focused primarily on identifying areas of a home that are candidates for reduced energy consumption.  For example, existing tools provide consumers with the ability to determine the effects of a more efficient appliance,
such as a refrigerator, on their overall energy consumption.  Residential consumers cannot understand and/or optimize their energy usage without appropriate tools and/or benchmark data.
<br/><br/> Energy measurement products providing energy usage data are increasingly available, including those that communicate this data across one or more networks.  These products can be used to facilitate a benchmarking system for residential
consumers, and permit energy usage data to be gathered and used in a more granular way.
<br/><br/> While existing residential energy management tools provide basic energy usage data, many areas of improvement remain.  For example, existing tools simply compare a consumer's energy usage data to average energy usage data.  Consumers would
benefit from individual challenges and/or direct comparisons, rather than simply comparisons to an average consumer.  In addition, many existing tools would benefit from a more intuitive display of energy comparison data that enables consumers to more
easily understand the data.  Accordingly, there is a need for systems and methods that present energy usage benchmarks in ways that are easy for consumers to understand, in addition to providing consumers with the ability to compare their energy usage to
other consumers.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Systems and methods for providing collaborative energy benchmarking are described.  Information including background data, energy consumption data, temporal data, and/or other information is gathered from multiple sources and stored in a central
database.  Based on the stored information, energy benchmarks are created for measuring residential energy usage.  Energy benchmarks include, but are not limited to, overall energy use and efficiency of energy use.  Energy usage data is displayed to
consumers in multiple formats, and permits consumers to directly compare their energy usage data to other consumers or groups of consumers, in addition to their own energy usage.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the techniques described herein encourage reduction of energy usage through energy challenge programs.  Through such programs, consumers create and present challenges for themselves and/or other consumers, such as to reduce
energy usage during a given timeframe.  The techniques described herein display the progress of the group and individual consumers during the course of a challenge.
<br/><br/> This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described herein in the Detailed Description.  This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject
matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Systems and methods for providing collaborative energy benchmarking are described.  Information including background data, energy consumption data, temporal data, and/or other information is gathered from multiple sources and stored in a central
database.  Based on the stored information, energy benchmarks are created for measuring residential energy usage.  Energy benchmarks include, but are not limited to, overall energy use and efficiency of energy use.  Energy usage data is displayed to
consumers in multiple formats, and permits consumers to directly compare their energy usage data to other consumers or groups of consumers, in addition to their own energy usage.  The present technology overcomes the limitations of the existing systems
described above, in addition to providing other benefits.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the techniques described herein encourage reduction of energy usage through energy challenge programs.  Through such programs, consumers create and present challenges for themselves and/or other consumers, such as to reduce
energy usage during a given timeframe.  The techniques described herein display the progress of the group and individual consumers during the course of a challenge.
<br/><br/> The present disclosure describes embodiments of consumer directed energy management systems and methods.  Several specific details are set forth in the following description and in the Figures to provide a thorough understanding of certain
embodiments of the disclosure.  One skilled in the art, however, will understand that the present disclosure may have additional embodiments, and that other embodiments of the disclosure may be practices without several of the specific features described
herein, or with additional features.
<br/><br/>1.  Embodiments of Computing Environments
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 and the following discussion provide a general description of a suitable computing environment in which aspects of the disclosure can be implemented.  Although not required, aspects and embodiments of the disclosure will be described in
the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as routines executed by a general-purpose computer, e.g., a server or personal computer.  Those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the disclosure can be practiced with other
computer system configurations, including Internet appliances, hand-held devices, wearable computers, cellular or mobile phones, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, set-top boxes, network PCs,
mini-computers, mainframe computers and the like.  The disclosure can be embodied in a special purpose computer or data processor that is specifically programmed, configured, or constructed to perform one or more of the computer-executable instructions
explained in detail below.  Indeed, the term "computer," as used generally herein, refers to any of the above devices, as well as any data processor.
<br/><br/> The disclosure can also be practiced in distributed computing environments, where tasks or modules are performed by remote processing devices, which are linked through a communications network, such as a Local Area Network ("LAN"), Wide Area
Network ("WAN"), or the Internet.  In a distributed computing environment, program modules or sub-routines may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.  Aspects of the disclosure described herein may be stored or distributed on
computer-readable media, including magnetic and optically readable and removable computer discs, stored as firmware in chips (e.g., EEPROM chips), as well as distributed electronically over the Internet or over other networks (including wireless
networks).  Those skilled in the relevant art will recognize that portions of the disclosure may reside on a server computer, while corresponding portions reside on a client computer.  Data structures and transmission of data particular to aspects of the
disclosure are also encompassed within the scope of the disclosure.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1, some embodiments of the disclosure employ a computer 100, such as a personal computer or workstation, having one or more processors 101 coupled to one or more user input devices 102 and data storage devices 104.  The
computer is also coupled to at least one output device such as a display device 106 and one or more optional additional output devices 108 (e.g., printer, plotter, speakers, tactile or olfactory output devices).  The computer may be coupled to external
computers, such as via an optional network connection 110, a wireless transceiver 112, or both.
<br/><br/> The input devices 102 may include a keyboard and/or a pointing device such as a mouse or haptic device.  Other input devices are possible such as a microphone, joystick, pen, touch screen, scanner, digital camera, video camera, and the like. 
The data storage devices 104 may include any type of computer-readable media that can store data accessible by the computer 100, such as magnetic hard and floppy disk drives, optical disk drives, magnetic cassettes, tape drives, flash memory cards,
digital video disks (DVDs), Bernoulli cartridges, RAMs, ROMs, smart cards, and other media.  Indeed, any medium for storing or transmitting computer-readable instructions and data may be employed, including a connection port to or node on a network such
as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN) or the Internet (not shown in FIG. 1).
<br/><br/> Aspects of the disclosure may be practiced in a variety of other computing environments.  For example, referring to FIG. 2, a distributed computing environment with a network interface includes one or more computing devices 202 (e.g., a client
computer) in a system 200, each of which includes a remote client module 204 that permits the computing device to access and exchange data with the network 206 (e.g., Internet or intranet), including web sites within the World Wide Web portion of the
Internet.  The computing devices 202 may be substantially similar to the computer described above with respect to FIG. 1.  Computing devices 202 may include other program modules such as an operating system, one or more application programs (e.g., word
processing or spread sheet applications), and the like.  The computing devices 202 may be general-purpose devices that can be programmed to run various types of applications, or they may be single-purpose devices optimized or limited to a particular
function or class of functions.  While shown with remote client applications using Internet protocols or proprietary communication protocols for communication via network 206, any application program (e.g., network browser) for providing a graphical user
interface to users may be employed, as described in detail herein.
<br/><br/> At least one server computer 208, coupled to the network 206 (e.g., Internet or intranet) 206, performs many or all of the functions for receiving, routing, and storing electronic messages, such as web pages, data streams, audio signals, and
electronic images.  While the Internet is discussed, a private network, such as an intranet, may indeed be preferred in some applications.  The network may have a client-server architecture, in which a computer is dedicated to serving other client
computers, or it may have other architectures such as peer-to-peer, in which one or more computers serve simultaneously as servers and clients.  In some embodiments, a database 210 or databases, coupled to the server computer(s), can store much of the
content exchanged between the computing devices 202 and the server 208.  The server computer(s), including the database(s), may employ security measures to inhibit malicious attacks on the system, and to preserve integrity of the messages and data stored
therein (e.g., firewall systems, secure socket layers (SSL), password protection schemes, encryption, and the like).
<br/><br/> The server computer 208 can also contain an internal memory component 220.  The memory 220 can be standard memory, secure memory, or a combination of both memory types.  The memory 220 and/or other data storage device 210 can contain computer
readable media having computing device instructions 222.  The encoded computing device instructions 222 are electronically accessible to at least one of the computing devices 208 and 202 for execution.  In further embodiments, computing device
instructions 222 can include basic operating instructions (e.g., source code) or other instructions.
<br/><br/> The server computer 208 may include a server engine 212, a web page management component 214, a content management component 216, a database management component 218 and a user management component 224.  The server engine performs basic
processing and operating system level tasks.  The web page management component 214 handles creation and display or routing of web pages.  Users may access the server computer by means of a URL associated therewith.  The content management component 216
handles most of the functions in the embodiments described herein.  The database management component 218 includes storage and retrieval tasks with respect to the database 210, queries to the database, read and write functions to the database and storage
of data such as video, graphics, and audio signals.  The user management component 224 can support authentication of a computing device to the server 208.
<br/><br/> Many of the functional units described herein have been labeled as modules, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence.  For example, modules may be implemented in software for execution by various types of
processors, such as processor 101.  An identified module of executable code may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, function, or algorithm. The identified blocks of computer instructions need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which, when joined logically together, comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for
the module.
<br/><br/> A module may also be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components.  A module may also be implemented in programmable
hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.
<br/><br/> A module of executable code may be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices.  Similarly, operational data may be
identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure.  The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different
locations including over different storage devices, and may exist, at least partially, merely as electronic signals on a system or network.
<br/><br/>2.  Collaborative Energy Benchmarking Systems and Methods
<br/><br/> Systems and methods for providing collaborative energy benchmarking are described.  Information including background data, energy consumption data, temporal data, and/or other information is gathered from multiple sources and stored in a central
database.  Based on the stored information, energy benchmarks are created for measuring residential energy usage.  Energy benchmarks include, but are not limited to, overall energy use and efficiency of energy use.  Energy usage data is displayed to
consumers in multiple formats, and permits consumers to directly compare their energy usage data to other consumers or groups of consumers, in addition to their own energy usage.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the techniques described herein encourage reduction of energy usage through energy challenge programs.  Through such programs, consumers create and present challenges for themselves and/or other consumers, such as to reduce
energy usage during a given timeframe.  The techniques described herein display the progress of the group and individual consumers during the course of a challenge.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a block diagram of data sources of a system 300 for providing collaborative benchmarking in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure.  The system 300 comprises multiple components for gathering and storing data relevant to the
creation of energy benchmarks.  As described in additional detail herein, data used for the creation of benchmarks includes background information 304, energy consumption information 306, temporal data 308, and other information.  This information is
stored in a central database 302.
<br/><br/> Background information 304 includes information about consumers and their residential properties, and is collected from multiple sources.  For example, a utility 310 can directly provide user background data 312 to the central database 302.  The
user background data 312 can be provided to the central database 302, for example, at the time a consumer joins the system, or any time thereafter.  In addition, when a consumer joins the system or at any time thereafter, the consumer can supply
background data 316 to the central database 302.  Background data includes, but is not limited to, the location, size (e.g., square footage), age, and construction materials of a residence; information about heating and/or cooling systems; information
about residential energy consuming devices; type of residence (e.g., primary residence, vacation home, rental property); information about the consumers of energy in the residence (e.g., number of consumers, ages of consumers); and/or other background
data.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the system 300 also obtains background information 304 from public sources of data, such as public housing data 318.  Public sources of background information 304 can include property tax databases that include information
about the size, age, and construction materials of residences; census databases that provide demographic information about residences and consumers; and other public databases.  In some embodiments, background information 304 is provided to the central
database 302 via a network, such as the Internet 324.
<br/><br/> The techniques described herein also collect and store energy consumption information 306.  Energy consumption information 306 includes information representing the actual usage data of the residential properties, and is also obtained from
multiple sources.  For example, a utility provider 310 can provide consumption data 314 to the central database 302.  The utility provider 310 collects such consumption data 314 for the purposes of billing the consumer.
<br/><br/> Because the consumption data 314 collected by a utility provider 310 is often not of a very fine granularity (e.g., this data may only be obtained on a monthly basis), and/or because the consumption data 314 may not be available directly to the
central database 302, it is desirable to have alternative sources of energy usage data.  As depicted in FIG. 3, the system 300 collects data directly and automatically from a consumer's residential premises 326 through the use of energy monitoring
devices 328 and 332.  The energy monitoring devices 328 and 332 transmit energy consumption information to an Energy Service Portal (ESP) device 330, which in turn transmits the information to the central database 302 for storage.  In some embodiments,
energy monitoring devices 328 (e.g., a networked utility meter or an individual circuit monitoring device) are directly connected to the ESP device 330 via an in-home network, while in other embodiments, energy monitoring devices 332 (e.g., a
non-networked electricity meter) are not network connected, but provide information to the ESP device 330 indirectly via a networked energy monitor reader 334.  In some embodiments, the ESP device 330 functions may reside in one or more of the energy
monitoring devices 328 and 332.
<br/><br/> The in-home network can be a wired and/or wireless network.  In some embodiments, the in-home network includes devices configured according to a single network technology, while in other embodiments, the in-home network includes devices
configured according to multiple network technologies.  Available network technologies include, but are not limited to, IEEE 802.11/WiFi, IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee, Homeplug, and other network technologies.
<br/><br/> Temporal data 308 includes information, such as weather data, that may affect the patterns of energy consumption.  Weather data 320 can include high and low temperatures for a given local area, the number of heating and cooling degree days
experienced in the local area, and other weather data.  In some embodiments, temporal information 308 is provided to the central database 302 via a network, such as the Internet 324.  Although the network over which temporal information 308 is provided
is depicted as the same network over which public sources of background information 304 are provided, one skilled in the art will appreciate that these may be different networks.
<br/><br/> Once information has been collected and stored, such as in a manner depicted in FIG. 3, the techniques described herein create and display energy benchmarks.  FIG. 4 is a block diagram of processing and display components of a system 400 for
providing collaborative energy benchmarking in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure.  These components provide the capability to create benchmarks, display the created benchmarks to consumers, and create energy conservation challenges using the
created benchmarks, in addition to other capabilities.
<br/><br/> A benchmark processing component 402 utilizes the data stored in the central database 302 to generate benchmarks of energy usage.  Benchmarks can be of a variety of different types, including benchmarks that measure overall energy usage (e.g.,
the total amount of energy used during a given timeframe), the efficiency of energy usage (e.g., the amount of energy used to achieve a given heating or cooling effect), and other types of benchmarks.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the system 400 encourages reduction of energy usage through challenge programs.  This functionality is provided by a challenge definition component 404 and a user challenge tracking component 406.  The challenge definition
component 404 allows consumers to define challenges for themselves and other consumers.  Challenges can be of a variety of formats, including specific timeframe challenges between or amongst groups of consumers, challenges that are specific to an
individual consumer, and other challenge formats.
<br/><br/> Examples of challenges that can be defined include, but are not limited to, (1) reduce energy usage of a group of consumers by a percentage amount for a given timeframe (e.g., reduce energy usage for the current month by 10% from the previous
month); (2) reduce energy usage by more than another group participating in the challenge (e.g., six neighborhoods each attempt to reduce energy usage by more than the other neighborhoods for a given week); (3) a single consumer sets a challenge to
reduce his or her energy usage for a given timeframe, compared with a different timeframe (e.g., reduce this July's energy usage by 5% from last July's energy usage).  These example challenges are provided for illustrative purposes only.  One skilled in
the art will appreciate that a variety of other challenges are contemplated by the techniques described herein.
<br/><br/> The techniques described herein calculate the amount of energy reduction that is required from individual consumers and from the group as a whole to meet a challenge.  The techniques described herein display the progress of the group and each
consumer during the course of the challenge.  For example, a consumer's progress may be displayed relative to other consumers in the group.  Consumers are encouraged to perform better than other consumers through this display.
<br/><br/> The user challenge tracking component 314 obtains challenge definitions from the challenge definition component 404, and uses information from the benchmark processing component 402 and the central database 302 to measure the performance of the
consumers participating in a challenge against the goals of that challenge.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, definitions of groups of consumers for challenges and of the challenges themselves are provided by consumers through a user interface, such as a web based user interface.  Alternatively or additionally, these definitions may
be provided by one or more external system user interfaces, such as social networking web sites (e.g., MySpace or <b><i>Facebook</i></b>).  The system 400 can utilize these external systems for group definition, such as by presenting a user interface on these systems
for challenge definition.
<br/><br/> As described above, a major shortcoming of existing tools for measuring and displaying energy consumption to consumers is the complexity of presented benchmarks and displays.  In accordance with the techniques described herein, a visual display
processor 408 obtains benchmark information from the benchmark processing component 402 and challenge performance information from the user challenge tracking component 406.  The visual display processor 408 generates simple displays of benchmark
information and/or challenge performance information, for the purposes of communicating energy performance information to consumers who are not specialists in the field of energy consumption.  These benchmarks are presented in a variety of visual and
numeric formats that allow consumers to easily visualize their energy usage and compare their energy usage to other consumers.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a screenshot of a user interface 500 for presenting benchmark data to consumers in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure.  FIG. 5 illustrates several outputs of the visual display processor 408 of FIG. 4.  These outputs are
provided for illustrative purposes only.  One skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of other outputs are contemplated by the techniques described herein.
<br/><br/> The user interface 500 includes a regional "heatmap" 502 that displays energy usage information associated with a geographic area.  Among other benefits, the regional heatmap 502 enables consumers to quickly and easily visualize the energy usage
of the displayed geographic area.  In some embodiments, the visual display processor 408 converts the benchmark numbers obtained from the benchmark processing component 402 of FIG. 4 into a simple scale.  The scale can be represented by colors or
otherwise distinguished in order to display differences in energy usage (e.g., low/average/high usage, or ranges of usage numbers).
<br/><br/> For example, for a benchmark that indicates the amount of energy used per month in kilowatt-hours/month (kWh/month), the visual display processor 408 can use the following procedure: (1) calculate the mean (M) and standard deviation (StDev) of
the benchmark data; (2) assign all benchmarks less than M-(1.5.times.StDev) the color green, to represent low energy usage; (3) assign all benchmarks greater than M+(1.5.times.StDev) the color red, to represent high energy usage; and (4) assign all
remaining benchmarks the color yellow to represent average energy usage.  This suitable procedure is provided for illustrative purposes only.  One skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of other processes may be used to convert benchmark
numbers into a representative scale.
<br/><br/> The visual display processor 408 takes background information 304, such as location data, from the central database 302 and constructs a regional heatmap 502 containing the benchmark colors for various location.  Among other benefits, such a
display of information allows a consumer to compare energy consumption across a geographic area and simplifies the consumer's understanding of energy consumption data.  In the example depicted in FIG. 5, the regional heatmap 502 includes multiple
benchmark color regions, including regions 504, 506, and 508.  As indicated by the usage color key 510, the region 504 is associated with low 512 energy usage, the region 506 is associated with average 514 energy usage, and the region 508 is associated
with high 516 energy usage.
<br/><br/> A consumer can change the information displayed on the regional heatmap 502 by selecting and/or deselecting options in the views area 534.  For example, the consumer can select which types of energy usage are displayed, such as electric, gas,
and/or water.  In addition, a consumer can choose to have his or her friends, such as friend 538, displayed on the regional heatmap 502.  The consumer can also select to display various boundaries, such as zip codes and/or roads, and/or to display a key
that provides more information about the selected data.  In addition, the consumer can change the displayed portion of the regional heatmap 502 by selecting various options in the zoom area 536.
<br/><br/> By selecting a displayed friend 538 on the regional heatmap 502 (e.g., by clicking on or letting a selection device hover over the friend 538), the consumer can view additional information 540 about the selected friend 538.  In the example
depicted in FIG. 5, the information 540 includes the names of the selected friend 538 (i.e., Fred and Jenny) and indicates how the selected friend 538 is doing in the current challenge (i.e., Reducing usage by 12%, exceeding 10% challenge goal).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the visual display processor 408 displays output from the user challenge tracking component 406 in the form of one or more charts and/or bar graphs 518 illustrating the performance of challenge participants.  For example, a
bar graph may represent the performance of each challenge participant relative to the other participants.  A variety of charts and bar graphs 518 may be presented, including, but not limited to, representations of a current challenge 520, monthly
consumption 522, year to date consumption 524, and a consumption comparison to last year 526.  In some embodiments, the associated benchmark for a consumer is converted into a color, such as by a process similar to that described above for the regional
heatmap 502.  In the example depicted in FIG. 5, a bar 528 represents low energy usage, while a bar 530 represents average energy usage.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the visual display processor 408 also presents to consumers with a simple measurement of their energy usage, such as a simple energy score 532.  In the example depicted in FIG. 5, the consumer's simple energy score 532 is
"average." Among other benefits, the simple energy score 532 allows the consumer to quickly and easily determine his or her energy consumption relative to other consumers in the challenge group.  In some embodiments, the visual display processor 408
simplifies multiple raw benchmark numbers into a single simple energy score 532.
<br/><br/> For example, the visual display processor 408 may construct a simple energy score 532 according to the following process: (1) select only consumers similar to a given consumer for whom a score is to be generated (e.g., consumers with residences
of similar size and in the same geographic area); (2) calculate the mean (M) and standard deviation (StDev) of the energy consumption for a given timeframe for the group selected in step 1; (3) if the consumer's energy consumption is above M+StDev,
assign the consumer a score of "Worse than Average"; (4) if the consumer's energy score is below M-StDev, assign the consumer a score of "Better than Average"; (5) otherwise, assign the consumer a score of "Average." Alternatively or additionally, the
simple energy score 532 can be expressed as a numerical score.  Among other benefits, such a numerical score provides more granularity of displayed information, while still reducing the complexity of the information displayed to the consumer.
<br/><br/> The user interface 542 also displays information associated with friends and/or other consumers in a current challenge 542.  In the example depicted in FIG. 5, a photo and name is displayed for each challenge friend 546.  While only a certain
number of challenge friends 546 (e.g., six friends) may be displayed by default, a consumer can see more challenge friends 548 by selecting a more link 548.  A consumer can add friends to the display by selecting an add friend link 544.  In some
embodiments, consumers specify particular individual consumers or groups of consumers to be compared to, while in other embodiments, the system selects the individual and/or groups of consumers for comparison, such as based on background data stored in
the database.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, consumers specify the amount and/or type of consumption and background data that is shared with other consumers.  Consumers may share different amounts and/or types of data with different groups of consumers.  For example, a
group of "friends" may be able to see more detailed information about a consumer than other consumers who are not friends.
<br/><br/> The displays generated by the visual display processor 408, such as those displays depicted in FIG. 5, are displayable to consumers through multiple mechanisms.  These display mechanisms include, but are not limited to, a web site display
component 410, a display device component 412, and a third party web site display component 414.  The web site display component 410 presents the displays generated by the visual display processor 408 on a consumer's computer 416 via a network 424.  In
some embodiments, the network 424 is a public network (e.g., Internet or an intranet), while in other embodiments, the network 424 is a private network (e.g., a Meter Reading Network or an Advanced Metering Infrastructure Network).
<br/><br/> The display device component 412 presents the displays generated by the visual display processor 408 on a display device 418, such as a dedicated energy monitor, via a network 422.  Dedicated energy monitors are described in additional detail in
reference to FIG. 6.  In some embodiments, the network 422 is a public network (e.g., Internet or an intranet), while in other embodiments, the network 422 is a private network (e.g., a Meter Reading Network or an Advanced Metering Infrastructure
Network).  While the networks 422 and 424 are depicted as separate networks, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the networks 422 and 424 may be the same network.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a display device 418 on which the display device component 412 may present the displays generated by the visual display processor 408.  The display device 418 includes a user interface 605 for displaying benchmark
data.  Because the display device 418 may have limited display size and/or functionality, the display device component 412 performs additional processing to simplify the displayed information.  For example, the display device component 412 may process
the information in order to match the capabilities of the display device 418.
<br/><br/> The device based user interface 605 has a Compare area 610 that includes a bar graph comparing the monthly energy usage of the consumer's home 615 to other groups of consumers, such as those in the consumer's zip code 620, town 625, and/or state
630.  The device based user interface 605 can provide the consumer with an at-a-glance indication of how the consumer is doing, such as via one or more icons 670 and 675.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the Compare 610 displays the current month as the selected month by default.  The consumer can select another month by using buttons 650 and 655 that correspond to arrows 635, by selecting a Home menu 640 via button 645, or
in another manner.  In some embodiments, the consumer presses the buttons 650 and/or 655 for a short duration to access a previous or subsequent month, respectively, and presses the buttons 650 and/or 655 for a longer duration to select a different
display, such as a different bar graph.  While the bar graph depicted in FIG. 6 displays monthly energy usage, one skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of other displays are possible, including charts and/or graphs of energy usage for
different timeframes.  Alternatively or additionally, the user interface 605 can display text, animations, videos, and/or a variety of other presentations of information.  The consumer can modify device 418 settings by selecting the Home 640 via
associated button 645, or in another manner.
<br/><br/> The display device 418 may include a variety of indicators 660 and 665 to communicate information to the consumer.  For example, indicators 660 and 665 may be light emitting diodes (LEDs) that communicate display device 418 status information to
the consumer, such as whether the display device 418 is on or off, a currently active setting, and/or a variety of other status information.
<br/><br/> Alternatively or additionally, a third party web site display component 414 presents the displays generated by the visual display processor 408 on a third party web site 420 via the network 424.  In some embodiments, the network 424 is a public
network (e.g., Internet or an intranet), while in other embodiments, the network 424 is a private network (e.g., a Meter Reading Network or an Advanced Metering Infrastructure Network).  Although the network 424 over which the web site display component
410 transmits data to the consumer's computer 416 and the network 424 over which the third party web site display component 414 transmits information to the third party web site 420 are depicted as the same network, one skilled in the art will appreciate
that these may be separate networks.
