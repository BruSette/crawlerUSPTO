     access to documents in an online document sharing community in a network
     environment including a plurality of participant computers operated by
     participants in the online document sharing community and a storage
     system. Document content is processed to add search terms for the
     document and a document identifier to a search index accessible through a
     search engine over the network to participants not under an obligation of
     confidentiality to the owner with respect to the document. Access is
     provided to the content of the document to the participants in the online
     document sharing community. A determination is made of a publication time
     the document was included in the search index and made accessible to the
     participant computers operated by participants not under the obligation
     of confidentiality to the owner of the document content.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Described embodiments provide for an online document sharing community to allow participants to share documents describing inventions and artworks subject to intellectual property protection in a manner that allows participants to protect their
intellectual property rights by controlling dissemination of the content of their documents and to expose their documents to other participants to promote development and commercialization.  With the online document sharing community embodiments,
participants may leverage the expertise of other participants and at the same time control the distribution of their intellectual property so as to preserve intellectual property protection to which they are entitled and release intellectual property in
a controlled manner to optimize results, such as establish prior art based on their release.
<br/><br/> In described embodiments, participants in the online document sharing community may provide documents to include in a document store and generate document information for the documents.  The documents may include subject matter protected by
intellectual property laws.  Access to the content of the document is provided through the use of a search engine and a search index that allows participants to search documents in the document store based on document content.  The server managing the
online document sharing community determines a publication time for documents in the document store that indicates a time the search engine makes the content of the document accessible to the participant computers operated by participants not under the
obligation of confidentiality to the owner with respect to the document content.  This publication time may be verified and used to establish a date the content of the document became prior art under patent laws in the United States and other countries,
and used to schedule when to file for patent protection in the United States and other countries based on the determined date the subject matter subject to intellectual property protection became publicly available.
<br/><br/> Further embodiments provide techniques to allow an owner of the document in the online document sharing community to control access to the documents in the document store to those participants that have accepted the terms of a non-disclosure
agreement (NDA) associated with the document.  Upon receiving a request from a requesting participant for a document, an access page is returned to the participant computer including a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) requesting that the requesting
participant accept terms of the NDA in order to access the content of the document.  The content of the document is returned to the requesting participant computer in response to receiving indication from the requesting participant computer accepting the
terms of the NDA.  Described embodiments provide the ability for the owner of the document to use the server to control access to the document based on participants accepting the terms of an NDA for the document.  Further, information on the number of
participants that have accepted and declined the NDA for the document may be recorded to provide meaningful information that may assist the owner in determining potential commercial and investor interest in the subject matter of the document.
<br/><br/> Further embodiments provide techniques for generating group information for a group created by the document owner indicating the document and participants in the online document sharing community as invitees.  A join message is sent to the
invitee participant computers including a description of the document that may exclude the content which may be subject to intellectual property protection (e.g., patent, copyright, trade secret).  The join message may include the NDA that the invitee
must accept to be provided access to all of the content of the document.  The described embodiments provide management of acceptances and declines of the NDA from the join message to record information on acceptances and declines, and allow the owner of
the document to manage and follow-up with invitees with respect to the NDA.
<br/><br/> Further embodiments provide techniques to associate friends with participants in the online document sharing community so that when a requesting participant requests a page, a determination is made of the friends of the requesting participant
and the documents owned by the friends.  A determination is made as to whether the friends' documents are private or public to determine whether to include information on the friends' documents in the requested page.  For instance, if the document is
public, then the returned page may include information and access to the content of the friends' documents.  If the friend's documents are private, then the requesting participant computer is only provided access to all the content of those friends'
documents when the requesting participant is a member of a group allowed to access those friends' documents.  In this way, participants that are friends of other participants may restrict accessibility to their documents to only friends and participants
that are specified in the group associated with the private document.  By restricting access in this manner, participants may protect any intellectual property rights emanating from the content of their documents by limiting access to their documents to
those participants that are under an obligation of confidentiality through an NDA or other oral or written agreement.
<br/><br/> Further embodiments provide techniques to determine documents to return to a request for a page of documents from requesting participants of the online document sharing community.  Upon determining documents to include in the page, such as
documents satisfying a search criteria provided with the request, an access element is included in the returned page to provide access to the content of the document if the document is public or if the document is private and the requesting participant
is a member of a group associated with the private document.  If the document to include is private and the requesting participant is not a member of the group of participants allowed access, then a public description of the document is included in the
page.  The public description may exclude those portions of the document content that may be eligible for intellectual property law protection.  This allows document owners to restrict dissemination of their intellectual property to selected participants
that perhaps have agreed to maintain the content of the document confidential.
<br/><br/> Moreover, comments from participants related to the document may be included in the page.  If the document is public, then all comments from all participants may be made accessible in the page.  Alternatively, if the document is private, then
comments from members of the group of the private document may only be included in the page if the requesting participant is also a member of the group.  In this way, an owner of a private document may restrict access to the content of the documents and
comments concerning the document to only participants that are members of the group of the private document.  Participants that are not members of the group of the private document may be limited to only access comments from participants that are not
members of the group, but may no not access all the document content and may not access comments from participants that are members of the group, who may be discussing the restricted document content.  By limiting access to comments in this way,
participants that are not a member of the group of the private document will not have access to the content and comments that may describe the document content subject to intellectual property law protection.
<br/><br/> Described embodiments provide an online document sharing community that allows participants to share creative and inventive subject matter and control the sharing of their intellectual property described in documents.  In this way, participants
may protect intellectual property rights by sharing their document with participants that are authorized or under an obligation of confidentiality.  Further, participants may expose their intellectual property in a more public manner to increase
commercial and investor interest, and to establish a date of the inventive subject matter to establish a prior art publication date under the patent laws.  Described embodiments enhance the sharing of ideas and inventive and creative concepts in a manner
that allows participants to obtain meaningful feedback to improve their inventions and artworks, protect their intellectual property rights, and expose their inventions and creative work in a controlled manner to encourage commercialization.

<br/><br/> FIGS. 10 and 11 concern information maintained for a document 14 that may be part of the information generated when verifying the publication date 172 in the public access information 170 for a document 14.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 provides publication test results 280 that may be associated with the document information 40 used to confirm that an indexed document 14 is publicly accessible such as to be sufficient to constitute a public disclosure according to the
patent laws, copyright and/or trade secret laws of the United States and other countries.  The test results 280 for a document 14 indicate one or more test computer identifiers (IDs) 282a .  . . 282n of computers 46 at various remote locations in the
network 16 that are recruited to test the public accessibility of the document 14 through the search engine 30 and access results 284a .  . . 284n indicating the results of attempted accesses of the document 14 by the corresponding test computer

maintained in the document store 8 available through the search engine 30.
<br/><br/> The information described with respect to FIGS. 2-11 may be stored in one or more records, entries or other data structures (e.g., Extended Markup Language (XML) files) maintained in the database 6.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 12a, 12b, and 12c illustrate an embodiment of operations performed by the document manager 24 or some other component to add document information 120 to the database 6 for a document 14 being added to the document store 8.  The operations
to add document information 120 are initiated (at block 320) upon receiving a request for at least one document submission page from a participant computer 12a, 12b .  . . 12n operated by a participant in the document sharing community for which
participant information 120 is maintained in the database 6.  The request handler 22 causes (at block 322) a transmission over the network 16 of at least one document submission page 400 (FIG. 13) to the participant computer 12a, 12b .  . . 12n used by
the participant in the online document sharing community 2.  By causing a transmission, the server 4 causes the transmission through the switches and routers of the network 16 to reach the final destination participant computer 12a, 12b .  . . 12n.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 provides an embodiment of a document submission page 400 having a select document graphical element 402 to enable the participant to select a document available through their participant computer 12a, 12b .  . . 12n to upload to the
server 4, which selected document is displayed in selection field 404.  A graphical element comprises a user interface control, such as a displayed button, text, icon, etc. that enables the participant to initiate a command associated with the graphical
element, such as to upload a document 402.  The select document graphical element 402 enables the participant at the participant computer 1a, 12b .  . . 12n to select a document to transmit to the server 4 to associate the transmitted document with the
participant's information 50 (FIG. 2).  Graphical elements 406 and 408 further enable the participant to indicate whether the document is private 406 or to be made publicly available 408.
<br/><br/> The participant may further enter a public description in a public description field 410 to be returned with search results for private and public documents.  The public description 410 may be saved as the public description 132 in the document
information 120 and may comprise a general description of the document 122.  For private documents, the public description may comprise a general description of the field to which the document pertains that does not disclose subject matter that would
jeopardize any intellectual property rights (e.g., patent, copyright, trade secret) in the United States and other countries arising from the full document contents.
<br/><br/> The participant may further enter search terms 412 in the add search terms field 412, which may be saved as the associated search terms 130 in the document information 120.  The added search terms 412 may include keywords, relevant industry
standards, relevant industries, relevant companies, and relevant products.
<br/><br/> Upon selecting the private option 406, the submission page 400 may allow the participant to select an allow public searching graphical element 414 to indicate whether the private document can be searched through the search index 32 by
participants not under an obligation of confidentiality to the owner of the document without returning all the document content, such as the content subject to intellectual property protection.  Further, upon selecting the option to allow public
searching 414, the submission page 400 may further display graphical elements to indicate which content may be indexed in the search index 32 for public searching by participants not under an obligation of confidentiality to the document owner with
respect to the document.  An index document content graphical element 416 allows the participant to select whether the text in the document may be indexed in the search index 32, an index public abstract graphical element 418 allows the participant to
select whether the text in the entered public description 410 may be indexed in the search index 32 for the document, and an index added search terms graphical element 420 allows the participant to select whether the added search terms entered in box 412
may be indexed in the search index 32 for the document.
<br/><br/> The send document graphical element 422 causes the transmission of the document with the private and public related selections entered in the submission page 400 using graphical elements 406, 408, 414, 416, 418, 420 and the information entered
in the fields 410 and 412.  The participant may not enter any description in box 410 for the public description 132 so that no public description is provided when the private document is returned in a search to a participant not under an obligation of
confidentiality to the owner with respect to the document.
<br/><br/> If the document is indicated as public, then the entire document is made available to participants not under an obligation of confidentiality to the document owner with respect to the document through the search engine 30 and the publication
date indicates a time the search engine 30 makes the content of the document available to the computer participants of the network not under an obligation of confidentiality to the owner with respect to the document.  In this way, selecting the send
document graphical element 422 for a public document causes the server 4 to verify or determine the publication date 140 when the document is publicly available through the search engine 30 to participants not under an obligation of confidentiality to
the document owner with respect to the document being added.
<br/><br/> The graphical elements 402 through 420 may be rendered in one transmitted document submission page 400 or rendered in multiple document submission pages.
<br/><br/> Upon receiving (at block 324) a returned document 14 to add via the invocation in the at least one document submission page 400 along with the information entered in the document submission page 400, the document manager 24 creates (at block
326) document information 120 (FIG. 3) for the document 14 to add having a document identifier 122, owner 126, a fingerprint 124 calculated using a fingerprint algorithm, any entered public description 132 and search terms entered in fields 410 and 412,
and other of the participant entered information for the document information 120.
<br/><br/> The document manager 24 further indicates (at block 330) in the document information 120 the participant's selection in the document submission page 400 that the document is public or private in the public/private flag 134.  If (at block 332)
the document is public, then the document manager 24 scans (at block 334) the document to determine all words in the document.  The document manager 24 updates (at block 336) the search index 32 to associate the document identifier of the added document
with all the determined words in the document, the words in the public description (entered in field 410 of the document submission page 400) and any added search terms (entered in field 412 of the document submission page 400) to cause the document
identifier 122 to be included in search results produced from queries presented to the search engine 30 specifying any of the words or stems of the words in the document, words in the public description 132 and added search terms 130.
<br/><br/> Control then proceeds to block 338 in FIG. 12b where the document manager 24 enables (at block 338) access to the content of the document 122 to the participants accessing the search engine 30 to obtain search results identifying the document
122.  For public documents, the document manager 24 further determines (at block 340) a publication date 140 the document was included in the public search index 32.  The publication date 140 indicates a time/date the search engine 30 made the full
content of the document available to the participants of the online community not under an obligation of confidentiality to the owner of the document, which may or may not include unregistered participants of the network 16.  The determined publication
date is indicated (at block 342) in the field 140 of the document information 120 being generated for the added document.  The document manger 24 then causes (at block 344) a transmission over the network 16 of confirmation that the document was added to
the search index 32 and the publication date 140 indicating the time/date that the document was included in the search index 32 and made publicly available to participants not under an obligation of confidentiality to the owner of the document with
respect to the document.  In certain embodiments, the server 4 verifies that the document is publicly available to satisfy the requirements for a public disclosure under patent laws of the United States and other countries, which may require that the
server 4 verifies that other computers may access the document as a result of searching for the document through the search engine 30.  The document manager 24 may further generate (at block 346) calendar alerts based on the publication date 140 to
electronically notify the author of patent filing due dates related to the publication date.
<br/><br/> If (at block 332) the document is indicated as private, then the document manager 24 determines (at block 346) whether the participant indicated to allow public searching of the document (searching by participants not under an obligation of
confidentiality to the owner of the document), which is indicated by the participant in the allow public searching graphical element 414 in the document submission page 400 (FIG. 13) and is indicated in the allow search indexing 230 field of the private
access options 136 (FIG. 7).  If not, control ends.  Otherwise, if the participant indicates to allow searching of the private document in the search index 32, then control proceeds to block 350 in FIG. 12c.
<br/><br/> If (at block 350) the participant indicated to index document content, as indicated in the index document content 416 graphical element in the document submission page 400, then the search engine 30 or document manager 24 scans (at block 352)
the document to determine all words in the document and updates (at block 354) the search index 32 to associate the document identifier of the added document with all the determined words in the document.  From the no branch of block 350 or block 354,
the document manager 24 determines (at block 356) whether the participant indicated to index the private document.  If so, then the search engine 30 or document manager 24 updates (at block 358) the search index 32 to associate the document identifier
122 of the added document with the words in the public description (entered in field 410 of the document submission page 400 (FIG. 13) and saved in field 132 of the document information 122 (FIG. 3)).  From the no branch of block 356 or block 358, the
document manager 24 determines (at block 360) whether the participant indicated to index added search terms.  If so, then the search engine 30 or document manager 24 updates (at block 362) the search index 32 to associate the document identifier 122 of
the added document with the added search terms (entered in field 412 of the document submission page 400 (FIG. 13) and saved in field 130 of the document information 122 (FIG. 3).  The document manager 24 provides (at block 364) access to participants
accessing the search engine 30 to obtain search results associated with the document in the search index 32.  The document manager 24 may further cause a transmission over the network 16 of confirmation that the document was added to the document store 8
and, if indexed, confirmation that the document is indexed in the search index 32 as specified (indexed by document content, search terms and/or, public description) and publicly searchable.
<br/><br/> With the described embodiments, the owner of a document may only allow indexing of terms from the public description and added search terms for a private document to prevent others from searching for the document based on terms related to the
novel, inventive and creative aspects of the document on which intellectual property protection may be based.  This would be done to prevent searches from revealing aspects of the document protected by intellectual property laws in a manner that may
jeopardize intellectual property rights.  Alternatively, the document may be indexed according to the terms of the document under the assumption that the inventive, novel, and creative works in the document will not be revealed by search results
returning the document and public information about the document.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 illustrates an embodiment of operations to submit a document to the online document sharing community performed by the viewer program 18 in the participant computer 12a, 12b .  . . 12n operated by a participant and executing code
included in the pages received from the server 4.  Control begins with the viewer 18 receiving (at block 430) the at least one document submission page 400.  The viewer 18 uses (at block 432) the document submit graphical element 422 to transmit the
document to the server and the private 406 and public 408 graphical elements to indicate the document as public or private.  If the document is private, the submission of the document may further indicate, using graphical elements 416, 418, and 420, the
terms that may be indexed for public searching (e.g., document content, public abstract, added search terms).  The viewer 18 may use (at block 434) the graphical element 410 to enter and transmit to the server 4 a public description of the document
indicated as private not including all the content of the document to make accessible to participants accessing the search engine to obtain search results identifying the document.  The provided public description 132 may exclude key subject matter, such
as the patentable, copyrightable or trade secret protected subject matter.  The viewer program 18 may then be controlled by the participant to use (at block 436) the add search term graphical element 412 to provide the server 4 associated search terms
130 to add to the search index 32 of the search engine 30, e.g., keywords; relevant industry standards, relevant industries, relevant companies, and relevant products.  The viewer program 18 may receive (at block 438) from the server 4 confirmation that
the search terms in the document content were added to the search index accessible through the network to computer participants not under an obligation of confidentiality to a owner of the document.  If the document is public, the viewer 18 would further
receive (at block 440) from the server the publication date 140 as determined and verified by the server 4.  The viewer 18 may further receive (at block 442) calendar alerts from the server 4 based on the publication date concerning notification of
patent filing due dates related to the publication date.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, the viewer 18 used by a registered or unregistered participant may transmit a request to the server 2 for a search result page for documents maintained in the document store 8.  The search request criteria may request all
documents having publication dates 140 within one year of a current date to determine documents that still may be eligible for patent protection in the United States.  The search engine 30 may then use the search index 32 to search for documents
satisfying the search request criteria and return a search result page indicating a description of documents satisfying the search request criteria, wherein the descriptions of the documents generated in the search result page include links to the
content of the documents and the publication dates 140 of the documents indicating indicate dates the search engine made the content of the documents publicly available to participants of the online document sharing community not under an obligation of
confidentiality to owners of the documents with respect to the document.  The document information presented in the search results page may indicate whether an application has been filed related to the content of the document.  The viewer program 18 may
then select from the search results pages the links to the documents to request the document content.
<br/><br/> FIG. 15 illustrates an embodiment of operations performed by the document manager 24 to determine and validate whether a document added to the search index 32 is in fact publicly available to participants accessing the search engine 30 over the
network 16 that are not under an obligation of confidentiality with respect to the document.  Upon initiating (at block 500) the public availability test for a document 14 being added to the search index 32, the document manager 24 sends (at block 502) a
request to a test computer 46 over the network 16 with search terms added to the search index 32 used by the search engine 30 in response to enabling access (at block 338 in FIG. 12b) to the content of the document to participants accessing the search
engine 30 that are not under an obligation of confidentiality to the owner of the document with respect to the document whose public availability is being tested.  The document manager 24 receives (at block 504) from the test computer 46 over the network
16 a search results time the test computer received from the search engine 30 the search results identifying the document and a document receipt time the test computer received the document content of the document after accessing the content of the
document through the received search results.  This document receipt time indicates a latest time the document was publicly available.  The document manger 24 further receives (at block 506) from the test computer 46 a test fingerprint calculated by the
test computer applying the fingerprinting algorithm to the content of the document accessed from the search engine 30.  The server 4 and test computers 46 use the same fingerprinting algorithm, so the same fingerprint is produced if the identical
document is processed fingerprinted.
<br/><br/> If (at block 508) the test fingerprint from the test computer matches the fingerprint 124 for the document in the document information 120 (FIG. 3), then the document manager 24 sets (at block 512) the publication date 140 to one of a time the
search engine 30 made the document available to the participants of the network not under the obligation of confidentiality, the search results time, and the document receipt time.  One of these times may be selected to use as the publication time 140
based on preferences of the server 4 administrator or the owner of the document.  The document manger 24 may further indicate (at block 514) in test results 280 (FIG. 10) for the test computer, identified by the test computer ID 282a .  . . 282n, the
access results 284a .  . . 284n, which may include a sent request time 290 the request to the test computer was sent, a search request time 292 the test computer 46 sent a search request to the search engine with the search terms, a document request time
294 the test computer sent the request for the document content, the search results time 296, the document receipt time 298 the document was received at the test computer, and the test fingerprint 300 comprising the fingerprint the test computer 282a . 
. . 282n calculated from the document using the same fingerprint algorithm the server 4 uses to calculate the fingerprint 124 for the document in the document information 120 (FIG. 11).  If (at block 508) the test fingerprint and fingerprint 124 do not
match, then an error is thrown (at block 510).
<br/><br/> With the described embodiments of FIG. 15, the server 4 may capture information on when the document was made publicly available in the search engine 30 that may be used later by the document owner as evidence of the public availability of the
document if such evidence is needed to establish a priority date of invention or a date the document may be considered as prior art under patent laws of the United States and other countries.  The use of the fingerprint provides further evidence that the
public availability access results 284a .  . . 284n are generated for a specific document identified by a unique fingerprint 124.  Such additional identifying evidence may assist in proving in a court of law the date the document was made publicly
available.
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 illustrates an embodiment of operations to process a request to create a group 260 (FIG. 9) associated with one or more documents from the owner of the documents 14 performed by a component of the manager 20, such as the account manger
28.  The request to create the group 260 may include indication as to whether the group is public or private 266, invitees 268, one or more documents 272, and indication 274 whether acceptance of terms of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is required by
each invitee in order to access the one or more documents 272 associated with the group 260.  Upon processing (at block 530) the request to create the group, the manager 20 creates (at block 532) group information 280 (FIG. 9) from the request indicating
the group owner 264 as the registered participant that initiated the request to create the group; the public/private flag 266; invitee IDs 268; initializes the member IDs 270 to empty; at least one or more document IDs 272 assigned to the group (where
only documents in which the participant creating the group is the owner may be included in the group); indication of whether an NDA is required 274; and optionally the NDA content 276.  The NDA content 276 may comprise a default NDA provided by the
manager 20, may comprise one of multiple NDA agreements provided by the manager 20 that are selected by the owner of the group or may comprise an NDA provided by the owner of the group.  If the owner does not provide an NDA, then a default NDA may be
used.  The manager 20 may provide different NDAs for different type of content, such as an NDA tailored to a utility invention subject to patent laws, an NDA tailored to a screenplay, novel subject to copyright laws, etc.
<br/><br/> The manager 20 may generate (at block 534) one or more join messages to the at least one invitee to join the member group, wherein the join message includes a public description of the document that does not include all the content of the
document, such as the title 128 and public access information 142 and/or public description 132.  If (at block 536) the group requires an NDA to access the at least one document 272, then the manager 20 includes (at block 538) NDA 276 content in the join
message requesting the invitee to accept terms of the NDA in order to accept the offer to join the group to access the full content of the document.  From block 538 or if an NDA is not required, the join message is sent (at block 540) to the at least one
invitee.  The join message may be sent via email, text message, web browser, social media web site (e.g., TWITTER.RTM., FACEBOOK.RTM., etc.) to the invitee.  (TWITTER is a registered trademark of Twitter Inc.  and <b><i>FACEBOOK</i></b> is a registered trademark if
<b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Inc.)
<br/><br/> FIG. 17 illustrates an embodiment of a join message 550 as including a document description 552, such as the title 128, public description 132, public access info 142, the owner/participant providing the document, and an NDA 554, such as
included in the NDA content 276, along with an accept graphical element 556 and a decline graphical element 558 enabling the invitee receiving the join message 550 to accept or not accept (decline) the terms of the NDA 540.  The accept graphical element
556 causes the viewer 18 to generate an accept message to the server 4 indicating agreement to accept the terms of the NDA to join the group.  The invitee is only allowed to access the content of the document associated with the group after selecting the
accept graphical element 556 indicating acceptance of the NDA terms.
<br/><br/> The document description 552 may not include all the content of the document, and may only include general information on the nature or field of the content of the document.  The document description 552 may exclude description of elements of
the invention, creative work, artistic work, intellectual work, and original material as described in the document that may form the basis of patent, copyright or other intellectual property protection.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, the manager 20 may require authentication of the participant accepting the terms of the NDA to authenticate the identity of the participant before content of a document is made available to the participant.  For instance,
upon accepting the NDA, the manager 20 may require biometric data, answer to authentication questions, etc. to authenticate the participant accepting the NDA.  Alternatively, the authentication may involve the owner of the document contacting the
accepting invitee to verify that the invitee is in fact accepting the terms of the NDA to access the document description.
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 illustrates an embodiment of an owner decline message 560 sent by the manager 20 to the owner of a group when an invitee selects the decline graphical element 558.  The owner decline message 560 includes decline information 562 which may
identify the invitee that selected the decline graphical element 558, information on the group, and a follow-up with declining invitee graphical element 564 enabling the owner of the group to communicate with the declining invitee, such as by requesting
the declining invitee to communicate with the owner of the group or by providing the declining invitee access to the document without requiring the NDA.  The decline information 562 may further indicate the document that the invitee declined.  If the
group is associated with multiple documents and the invitee selected to accept the NDA with respect to certain of the documents in the group and not others, then the owner decline message 560 is only generated for those documents for which the invitee
selected to decline the NDA.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the accept 556 and decline 558 graphical elements may be associated with code embedded in the join message 550 that when executed by the participant viewer 18 executing in the participant computer 12a, 12b .  . . 12n causes
the transmission of an NDA accept message 550 or decline message 560 (FIG. 18) to the server 4 to forward to the group owner 264 of the at least one document 272 indicating that the invitee accepted or declined the NDA of the document.
<br/><br/> In further embodiments, the join message 550 may include graphical elements to allow the invitee to accept and decline the NDA with respect to specific documents associated with the group.  In such case, the group information 260 would maintain
for each member 270 of the group indication of those documents for which the NDA was declined or accessed, so that a group member is only allowed access to the documents for which they accepted the NDA.
<br/><br/> FIG. 19 illustrates an embodiment of operations performed by the viewer 18 upon processing the code and content within a received join message 550 (FIG. 17) for a participant comprising an invitee to the group associated with the received the
join message.  Upon receiving the join message 550 (at block 580) from the server 4 to join a group 280 associated with at least one document 272, if (at block 582) the invitee does not accept the terms of the displayed NDA 554 by interactively selecting
the decline graphical element 556, then the viewer program 18 transmits (at block 584) an NDA decline message to the server 4 to cause the server 4 to forward to the owner of the document an owner NDA decline message 560 (FIG. 18) indicating that the
participant declined to accept the NDA of the document.  If (at block 582) the participant selected the accept graphical element 556, then the viewer 18 transmits (at block 586) an acceptance message indicating acceptance of the terms of the NDA to the
server 4 to join the group and a time/date the acceptance was made.  The viewer 18 may then after transmitting acceptance receive (at block 588) access to the full content of the at least one document for which the terms of the NDA were accepted.  As
mentioned, additional authentication of the invitee may be performed by the manager 20 or the owner of the document of an invitee accepting the NDA to authenticate the identity of the accepting NDA.
<br/><br/> FIG. 20 illustrates an embodiment of operations performed by a component of the manager 20, such as the account manager 28 managing the groups, to process an acceptance of the terms of a join message 550 from an invitee.  Upon receiving (at
block 600) acceptance of the terms of the join message 550 from one invitee 268, which acceptance message is transmitted at block 586 (FIG. 19), the manager 20 indicates (at block 602) the invitee sending the acceptance message as a member of the group
in response to receiving the accept message from the invitee.  In certain embodiments, access to the document is only provided to those invitees that have joined the group by selecting the accept graphical element 556 to send the accept message.  The
manager 20 further may update (at block 604) the private access information 190 to increment the number of NDA acceptances 198 and indicate in the NDA acceptances 200 the time/date the invitee accepted, which is communicated in the acceptance message.
<br/><br/> FIG. 21 illustrates an embodiment of operations performed by a component of the manager 20, such as the account manager 28 managing the groups, to process an NDA decline message 560 from an invitee participant computer.  Upon receiving (at block
620) an NDA decline message from an invitee participant computer 12a, 12bb .  . . 12n, the document sharing component 20 generates (at block 622) an owner NDA decline message 560 to the owner of the group document including decline information 562
indicating that the at least one invitee participant declined to accept the NDA of the document.  Further, for groups associated with multiple documents, one or more owner NDA decline messages 560 may be provided to the owner of the group for those
documents the invitee declined the NDA and not the documents for which the invitee accepted the NDA.  The owner NDA decline message 560 may include (at block 624) a follow-up graphical element or control 564 enabling the owner of the document receiving
the owner NDA decline message 560 to send an NDA decline follow-up message to the invitee that declined to accept the NDA and a graphical element or control enabling the owner to include in the follow-up message access to the full content of the document
without accepting the NDA, such as the content itself or a hypertext link to the content.  The follow-up message may request that the invitee contact the owner to further discuss the document through messages maintained in the message store 42, or
include the graphical element allowing access without NDA acceptance terms should the owner of the document decide to waive the requirements of the NDA due to the perceived importance of the particular invitee.  The owner NDA decline message is then
forwarded (at block 626) to the owner of the document that created the group.  The document manager 24 may indicate (at block 628) in the document information 120 a number of times 202 the NDA for the document was declined (FIG. 6) by invitees/requesting
computers and the declining participant ID and time declined in the field 204 of the private access information 190 for the requested document.
<br/><br/> FIG. 22 illustrates an embodiment of operations performed by the viewer program 18, in an owner computer, comprising one of the participant computers 12a, 12b .  . . 12n, used by the owner creating the group.  At block 640, the viewer program 18
used by the group owner transmits (at block 640) a request over the network 16 to the server 4 to create a group associated with a document and requiring invitees to the group to sign an NDA agreement.  The transmission at block 640 invokes the
operations of FIG. 16 performed by the server 4 to create the group 260.  At block 642, the owner computer receives the owner NDA decline message 560 that includes a follow-up graphical element 564 (FIG. 18) enabling the owner of the document to send an
NDA decline follow-up message to the invitee participant computer that declined to accept the NDA.  The owner computer 12a, 12b .  . . 12n creating the group may further receive (at block 644) from the server 4 over the network 16 private access
information 190 (FIG. 6) indicating a number of times the document was returned in search results 194, number of participant accesses 196 to the document, number of NDA accesses 198, number of NDA acceptances 200, including the participant ID and
time/date the NDA was accepted, a number of NDA declines 202, and declining participants IDs and the date/time of the NDA declines 204.
<br/><br/> With the embodiments described with respect to FIGS. 16-22, a participant in the online document sharing community may create a group associated with one or more documents.  If the group is private, then a join message sent to the invitees may
require they accept the NDA in order to access the full content of the one or more documents associated with the group.  Further, information on the invitees that have declined and accepted the NDA may be provided to the owner of the group, as well as
the capability for the owner of the group to follow up with any declining invitees to inquire about their decision to decline the NDA and to allow the owner to provide access to the document without requesting the NDA, thereby overriding the NDA and its
legal effect.
<br/><br/> FIG. 23 illustrates an embodiment of operations performed by a component of the manager 20, such as the request handler 22, document manager 24, etc., to receive a request for a page from a requesting participant.  Upon receiving (at block 670)
a request for a page with information on documents 14, a determination is made (at block 672) of documents to include in the requested page.  For instance, if the page request includes a search criteria or document identifying criteria, then the
documents to identify in the requested page may comprise documents 14 satisfying the specified search criteria or identified by the document identifying criteria.  The manager 20 determines (at block 674) whether the document information 120 for the
document to include indicates the document is public or private, such as from the flag 134 (FIG. 3).  If (at block 674) the document is public, then access (such as the content itself or an access element, e.g., hypertext link, etc.), is included (at
block 676) in the page to provide access to the content of the determined document.  The manager 20 may further include all the comments (at block 678) for the determined document in the comment database 44 as well as the publication date 140 (at block
680).
<br/><br/> If (at block 674) the document is private, then a determination is made (at block 682) whether the requesting participant is a member of a group 260 of participants allowed to access the document.  If so, control proceeds to block 676 to include
access to the document (such as the document content access elements in the page) to enable access to the content of the document to the requesting participant.  If (at block 682) the requesting participant is not a member of the group associated with
the determined document, then a determination is made (at block 684) as to whether public information to be provided to group non-member requestors, which may be indicated in the provide public info field 228 of the private access operations 136.  If
public information is to be provided, then the manager 20 includes (at block 686) in the page an access element to provide access to a public description of the document not including all the content of the document, such as excluding the content for
which intellectual property protection is available.  The manager 20 may further include (at block 688) in the page comments for the document from participants that are not members of the group allowed access to the document, and the submit date 138 of
the document may also be included.  If (at block 684) public information is not to be provided to non-member requesting participants, then no information on the document is included (at block 692) in the page to return to the requesting participant
computer 12a, 12b .  . . 12n.
<br/><br/> With the operations of FIG. 23, the page returned to the requesting participant may determine the information about the document and comments based on whether the document is private or public, and, if private, whether the requesting participant
is a member of the group of participants allowed to access the documents.  The operations of FIG. 23 ensure that only members of the group allowed to access all the content of the document may receive comments from the other members of the group that
have access to all the content.  Further, requesting participants that are not members of the group may receive public information on a private document, which excludes the content subject to intellectual property protection, and receive comments from
other participants commenting on the document that are not members of the group and would also not have access to all the content.  The described embodiments thus provide a technique for making comments from different sets of participants available to
requesting participants requesting a document based on the status of the document, public or private, and whether the requesting participant is a member of the group allowed access to all the document content.  The operations of FIG. 23 prevent a
participant that is not a member of the group of the private document from learning about the protected content through the comments from members of the group that have access to the full content of the document.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 24a and 24b illustrate an embodiment of operations performed by a component of the manager 20, such as the request handler 22, document manager 24, etc., to process a request for a document from a requesting participant computer 12a, 12b . . . 12n having private access operations.  Upon receiving (at block 710) the document request from a requesting participant, a determination is made (at block 712) if the requesting participant is a member of one of the groups 260 associated with the
document, such as the one or more groups 260 identifying the requested document in the document field 272 (FIG. 9).  If (at block 712) the requesting participant is a member of the group associated with the document, then a page is transmitted (at block
714) to the requesting participant computer providing access to the full content of the document, such as by including the document content, a link to the document content, etc. If (at block 712) the requesting participant is not a member of one of the
determined groups 260 associated with the document, then if (at block 716) the requesting participant is an invitee of the group, as indicated in field 268, then the join message 550 (FIG. 17) is sent (at block 718) to the requesting participant
requesting to join the group.
<br/><br/> If (at block 718) the requesting participant is not an invitee of the group, then if (at block 720) group access only is indicated for the requested document in field 226, indicating that only members of the group may access the document, then
the document request is declined (at block 722).  If (at block 720) the group access only field 226 indicates that participants not members of the group may be eligible to access the document and if (at block 724) the NDA access required 274 field
indicates that an NDA is required to access the documents for the group, then the manager 20 transmits (at block 726) to the requesting participant computer an access page including a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) requesting the requesting participant
to accept terms of the NDA in order to be provided access to the content of the document.  Upon receiving (at block 730) an acceptance of the terms of the NDA from the requesting participant, the requesting participant is indicated (at block 732) as a
member 270 of the group.  Indication is made (at block 734) in the NDA acceptances 200 (of the private access information 144 of the document information 120) the participant IDs of participants that have accepted the NDA and times/dates the NDA was
accepted by the participants.
<br/><br/> If (at block 724) an NDA is not required and access requests to the owner are allowed (at block 728), as indicated in field 222 of the private access options 136, then control proceeds to block 750 in FIG. 24b to transmit to the requesting
participant computer a contact page enabling the requesting participant to send a message to the owner of the document requesting access to the document.
<br/><br/> The manager 20 transmits (at block 752) a message to the document owner computer enabling the owner to provide access to the document to the requesting participant with or without an NDA.  Upon receiving (at block 754) an authorization message
from the document owner to offer access to the requesting participant, if (at block 756) the authorization does not require an NDA, then the manager 20 adds (at block 758) the requesting participant as a member of the group 260 associated with the
document.  If (at block 756) the authorization requires an NDA, then control proceeds to block 726 in FIG. 24a to transmit the access page to the requesting participant computer requesting acceptance of the NDA to access the document.  If (at block 756)
the authorization does not require an NDA to access, then the manager 20 adds (at block 758) the requesting participant as a member 270 of the group 260 associated with the document and a page is returned (at block 760) to the requesting participant
computer 12a, 12b .  . . 12n providing access to the full content of the document, such as by providing the content or a link to the full content.
<br/><br/> FIG. 25 illustrates an embodiment of operations performed by one or more components of the manager 20, such as the request handler 22, document manager 24, etc., to process a request for a friend page from a requesting participant computer 12a,
12b .  . . 12n.  Upon receiving (at block 800) the request, the manager 20 determines (at block 802) participant information in the database 34 for friends of the requesting participant, which may be indicated in the friends field 60 of the participant
information 50 for the requesting participant.  A determination is made (at block 804) from the document information 120 associated with the participants indicated as friends documents owned by the friend participants.  The document information 120 may
be for documents for which the determined friends are the owner.  For each determined document owned by the friend participants, the manager 20 may perform (at block 806) the operations at blocks 674 through 692 in FIG. 23 to include information and
links to the determined documents in the friend page.  The manager 20 may further determine (at block 808) at least one document owned by the requesting participant to include in the friend page.  The manager 20 may include in the page, for the at least
one determined document owned by the requesting participant, a description of the document and the comments by the friend participants and the requesting participants for the at least one determined document.
<br/><br/> With the operations of FIG. 25, the document sharing manager may create a page for a requesting participant having information on documents owned by friends of the requesting participant and the requesting participant documents including
comments to allow the requesting participant to engage in conversation about their own and friends' documents.  This allows a private group of inventors or artists to share their work the friends page to receive meaningful comments from a select group of
participants to allow them to more fully develop the inventions and creative content described in their documents.

<br/><br/>Conclusion
<br/><br/> The described operations may be implemented as a method, apparatus or computer program product using standard programming and/or engineering techniques to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof.  The described
operations may be implemented as code maintained in a "computer readable storage medium", where a processor may read and execute the code from the computer storage readable medium.  A computer readable storage medium may comprise a device of storage
media such as magnetic storage medium (e.g., hard disk drives, floppy disks, tape, etc.), optical storage (CD-ROMs, DVDs, optical disks, etc.), volatile and non-volatile memory devices (e.g., EEPROMs, ROMs, PROMs, RAMs, DRAMs, SRAMs, Flash Memory,
firmware, programmable logic, etc.), Solid State Devices (SSD), etc. The code implementing the described operations may further be implemented in hardware logic implemented in a hardware device (e.g., an integrated circuit chip, Programmable Gate Array
(PGA), Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), etc.).  Still further, the code implementing the described operations may be implemented in "transmission signals", where transmission signals may propagate through space or through a transmission
media, such as an optical fiber, copper wire, etc. The transmission signals in which the code or logic is encoded may further comprise a wireless signal, satellite transmission, radio waves, infrared signals, Bluetooth, etc. The program code embedded on
a computer readable storage medium may be transmitted as transmission signals from a transmitting station or computer to a receiving station or computer.  Those skilled in the art will recognize that many modifications may be made to this configuration
without departing from the scope of the present invention, and that the article of manufacture may comprise suitable information bearing medium known in the art.
<br/><br/> FIG. 26 illustrates an implementation of a computer architecture 900 that may be implemented at the server 4, the participant computers 12a, 12b .  . . 12n and the test computers 46.  The architecture 900 may include a processor 902 (e.g., one
or more microprocessors and cores), a memory 904 (e.g., a volatile memory device), and storage 906 (e.g., a non-volatile storage, such as magnetic disk drives, solid state devices (SSDs), optical disk drives, a tape drive, etc.).  The storage 906 may
comprise an internal storage device or an attached or network accessible storage.  Programs, including an operating system 908 and applications 910 stored in the storage 906 are loaded into the memory 904 and executed by the processor 902.  The
applications 910 may include the described manager 20 its components 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, and 32 and other program components described above.  The architecture 900 further includes a network card 912 to enable communication with the network 16.  An input
device 914 is used to provide user input to the processor 902, and may include a keyboard, mouse, pen-stylus, microphone, touch sensitive display screen, or any other activation or input mechanism known in the art.  An output device 916, such as a
display monitor, printer, storage, etc., is capable of rendering information transmitted from a graphics card or other component.  The output device 916 may render the GUIs described with respect to figures and the input device 914 may be used to
interact with the graphical controls and elements in the GUIs described above.  The architecture 900 may be implemented in any number of computing devices, such as a server, mainframe, desktop computer, laptop computer, hand held computer, tablet
computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), telephony device, cell phone, etc.
<br/><br/> The terms "an embodiment", "embodiment", "embodiments", "the embodiment", "the embodiments", "one or more embodiments", "some embodiments", and "one embodiment" mean "one or more (but not all) embodiments of the present invention(s)" unless
expressly specified otherwise.
<br/><br/> The terms "including", "comprising", "having" and variations thereof mean "including but not limited to", unless expressly specified otherwise.
<br/><br/> The enumerated listing of items does not imply that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive, unless expressly specified otherwise.
<br/><br/> The terms "a", "an" and "the" mean "one or more", unless expressly specified otherwise.
<br/><br/> The use of variable references, such as "a", "n", etc., to denote a number of instances of an item may refer to any integer number of instances of the item, where different variables may comprise the same number or different numbers.  Further, a
same variable reference used with different elements may denote a same or different number of instances of those elements.
<br/><br/> Devices that are in communication with each other need not be in continuous communication with each other, unless expressly specified otherwise.  In addition, devices that are in communication with each other may communicate directly or
indirectly through one or more intermediaries.
<br/><br/> A description of an embodiment with several components in communication with each other does not imply that all such components are required.  On the contrary a variety of optional components are described to illustrate the wide variety of
possible embodiments of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Further, although process steps, method steps, algorithms or the like may be described in a sequential order, such processes, methods and algorithms may be configured to work in alternate orders.  In other words, any sequence or order of steps
that may be described does not necessarily indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order.  The steps of processes described herein may be performed in any order practical.  Further, some steps may be performed simultaneously.
<br/><br/> When a single device or article is described herein, it will be readily apparent that more than one device/article (whether or not they cooperate) may be used in place of a single device/article.  Similarly, where more than one device or article
is described herein (whether or not they cooperate), it will be readily apparent that a single device/article may be used in place of the more than one device or article or a different number of devices/articles may be used instead of the shown number of
devices or programs.  The functionality and/or the features of a device may be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices which are not explicitly described as having such functionality/features.  Thus, other embodiments of the present invention
need not include the device itself.
<br/><br/> The illustrated operations of the figures show certain events occurring in a certain order.  In alternative embodiments, certain operations may be performed in a different order, modified or removed.  Moreover, steps may be added to the above
described logic and still conform to the described embodiments.  Further, operations described herein may occur sequentially or certain operations may be processed in parallel.  Yet further, operations may be performed by a single processing unit or by
distributed processing units.
<br/><br/> The description of various embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.  It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed.  Many modifications and
variations are possible in light of the above teachings.  It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description, but rather by the claims appended hereto.  The above specification, examples and data provide a complete
description of the manufacture and use of the composition of the invention.  Since many embodiments of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, the invention resides in the claims hereinafter appended.
