<br/><br/> The subject matter disclosed herein relates to automation systems and more particularly relates to optimizing automation system settings using crowdsourcing.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/>Description of the Related Art
<br/><br/> Automation systems provide remote and automatic control of various interconnected devices within a home or office, such as climate control systems, security systems, appliances, irrigation systems, etc. A homeowner, for example, may set a
schedule on an automation device, such as a smart thermostat, and the device may run according to the preferences of the homeowner.  Users may also adjust automation device settings using a connected mobile device, such as a smart phone or tablet
computer.  Home automation systems may also alert a homeowner of certain events, such as water leaks or security breaches.
<br/><br/> Even though automation systems may provide many conveniences to a user, an automation system may still require a user to specify various automation settings.  A user, however, may not know how to configure the automation devices such that they
run as efficiently as possible.  Crowdsourcing is a way to obtain ideas, content, information, etc., from a large group of people and may be particularly effective when obtaining information from an interconnected, online community.  Thus, it may be
desirable to incorporate crowdsourcing features into an automation system such that automation settings may be shared among multiple users in order to set an automation system to run as efficiently as possible.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the embodiments may be embodied as a system, method or program product.  Accordingly, embodiments may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment
(including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a "circuit," "module" or "system." Furthermore, embodiments may take the form of a program
product embodied in one or more computer readable storage devices storing machine readable code.  The storage devices may be tangible, non-transitory, and/or non-transmission.
<br/><br/> Many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence.  For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising
custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components.  A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable
array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.
<br/><br/> Modules may also be implemented in machine readable code and/or software for execution by various types of processors.  An identified module of machine readable code may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of
executable code which may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, or function.  Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different

<br/><br/> Indeed, a module of machine readable code may be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices.  Similarly, operational
data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure.  The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over
different locations including over different computer readable storage devices, and may exist, at least partially, merely as electronic signals on a system or network.  Where a module or portions of a module are implemented in software, the software
portions are stored on one or more computer readable storage devices.

<br/><br/> Descriptions of Figures may refer to elements described in previous Figures, like numbers referring to like elements.  FIG. 1 depicts one embodiment of a system 100 for optimizing automation settings using crowdsourcing.  In an embodiment, the
system 100 includes a receiving participant 102a, one or more sharing participants 102b, an automation settings apparatus 104, and a data network 106, which are described in more detail below.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the system 100 includes a receiving participant 102a configured to receive one or more automation settings from one or more sharing participants 102b.  In certain embodiments, the automation settings are associated with one or
more automation systems being used by the owner of the sharing participant 102b.  In a further embodiment, the automation settings are the settings currently in use by the sharing participants 102b.  The receiving participant 102a, in some embodiments,
is also a sharing participant 102b and is configured to share one or more automation settings with other participants 102.  In certain embodiments, the receiving participant 102a includes one or more home automation systems, such as a climate control
system, a security system, and/or the like.  For example, a home climate control system may receive one or more climate control settings from the one or more sharing participants 102b, such as the temperature settings of a sharing participant 102b at a
certain time of day.  The receiving participant 102a may then adjust the home climate control settings based on the climate control settings received from the sharing participant 102b (e.g., by changing the settings on a thermostat).
<br/><br/> In another example, a receiving participant 102a may include a home security system.  The home security system may receive one or more security system settings from one or more sharing participants 102b and make adjustments to the home security
system based on the received settings.  For example, the home security system associated with the receiving participant 102a may adjust security camera settings, access settings, lock down settings, and/or the like.  The receiving participant 102a may
include other automation systems, such as home irrigation systems (e.g., lawn sprinklers), lighting systems, home entertainment systems, appliances, and/or the like.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, the receiving participant 102a and the one or more sharing participants 102b are in communication over a data network 106, which is described in more detail below.  For example, the receiving participant 102a may receive
automation settings from a sharing participant 102b located anywhere in the world using a global data network, such as the Internet.  In other embodiments, the receiving participant 102a and the sharing participants 102b may communicate using a private
network.  In some embodiments the participants 102 may share and receive automation settings using a centralized and/or decentralized peer-to-peer network.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the receiving participant 102a receives additional information associated with the automation settings, such as proximity information, location information, schedule information, presence information, usage information,
and/or the like.  The receiving participant 102a, in certain embodiments, determines whether and/or how to adjust local automation settings based on the additional information.  For example, a receiving participant 102a located in a warm climate
environment may not make climate adjustment based on climate control settings received a user located in a cold climate environment.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the participants 102 opt-in to sharing and/or receiving automation settings.  In some embodiments, a user may elect to opt-in to sharing/receiving automation settings using a web interface, such as a website, a social
networking site (e.g., <b><i>Facebook</i></b>), a mobile application, and/or the like.  In other embodiments, a user may elect to share and/or receive home automation settings using a home automation device, such as a smart thermostat, a security system control panel,
and/or the like.  In some embodiments, the user may select the types of automation settings to share and/or receive.  For example, a user may select to share only climate control settings while receiving climate control and security system settings.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the system 100 includes one or more sharing participants 102b.  The one or more sharing participants 102b, in some embodiments, are configured to share one or more automation settings with one or more receiving
participants 102a.  In certain embodiments, the one or more sharing participants 102b are also embodied as receiving participants 102a, as described above.  The sharing participants 102b may be located at various locations, such as homes, offices, retail
stores, industrial businesses, and/or the like.  The sharing participants 102b, in some embodiments, share various automation settings, such as climate control settings, security settings, irrigation settings, home entertainment settings, appliance
settings, and/or the like.  Even though only three sharing participants 102b are depicted, any number of sharing participants 102b may be incorporated into the system 100.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, the receiving 102a and sharing 102b participants are divided into groups/communities, such that receiving participants 102a only receive automation settings from sharing participants 102b that are in the same group as the
receiving participants 102a.  In certain embodiments, the participants 102 may be members of multiple groups.  In another embodiment, a participant 102 may customize a group by selecting specific participants 102 to be part of the group.  For example, a
participant 102 may select their neighbors that are within a close proximity to form a group, which may provide sharing and receiving automation settings that are more relevant to the participant's 102 area.  In certain embodiments, groups may be created
using a social network platform, such as Facebook.RTM., or may be created by participants 102 manually entering group information, such as a group identifier, to join an already created group.
<br/><br/> The system 100, in one embodiment, includes an automation settings apparatus 104 configured to send and/or receive one or more automation settings to/from the participants 102.  In another embodiment, the automation settings apparatus 104
adjusts one or more local automation settings based on one or more received automation settings.  In certain embodiments, the automation settings apparatus 104 is located on a receiving participant 102a or a sharing participant 102b.  In some
embodiments, portions of the automation settings apparatus 104 are located on the both the receiving 102a and sharing 102b participants.  The automation settings apparatus 104 may include one or more modules, which are described below in more detail with
reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, to perform the operations of sending/receiving automation settings and adjusting one or more local automation settings.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the system 100 includes a data network 106.  The data network 106, in certain embodiments, is a digital communication network 106 that transmits digital communications related to optimizing automation settings.  The
digital communication network 106 may include a wireless network, such as a wireless telephone network, a local wireless network, such as a Wi-Fi network, a Bluetooth.RTM.  network, and the like.  The digital communication network 106 may include a wide
area network ("WAN"), a storage area network ("SAN"), a local area network ("LAN"), an optical fiber network, the internet, or other digital communication network known in the art.  The digital communication network 106 may include two or more networks. 
The digital communication network 106 may include one or more servers, routers, switches, and/or other networking equipment.  The digital communication network 106 may also include computer readable storage media, such as a hard disk drive, an optical
drive, non-volatile memory, random access memory ("RAM"), or the like.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 depicts one embodiment of an apparatus 200 for optimizing automation settings using crowdsourcing.  In certain embodiments, the apparatus 200 includes an automation settings apparatus 104.  The automation settings apparatus 104, in an
embodiment, includes a settings module 202, a matching module 204, and a regulating module 206, which are described below in more detail.
<br/><br/> The automation settings apparatus 104, in one embodiment, includes a settings module 202 configured to receive one or more automation settings from one or more sharing participants 102b.  In certain embodiments, the one or more automation
settings are associated with the one or more sharing participants 102b.  For example, the settings module 202 may receive climate control settings from one sharing participant 102b and security system settings from a different sharing participant 102b. 
In one embodiment, the settings module 202 receives the one or more automation settings using the data network 106.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the settings module 202 receives automation settings that have been specified by a user.  For example, the user may choose to only receive climate control automation settings and not security system settings.  The settings
module 202 may filter out received automation settings that do not meet the specifications of the user.  In another embodiment, the settings module 202 filters automation settings based on various criteria, including location, proximity, schedule, and/or
the like, of the sharing participant 102b associated with the received settings.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the settings module 202 periodically polls one or more sharing participants 102b to check if there are automation settings available.  In certain embodiments, a user determines how often the settings module 202 polls the
one or more sharing participants 102b.  For example, a user may set the settings module 202 to poll for climate control settings every two hours such that the local automation settings are not constantly adjusted.  Alternatively, a user may set the
settings module 202 to poll for climate control settings every five minutes in order to finely tune one or more local climate control automation settings by frequently receiving climate control settings.
<br/><br/> The settings module 202, in one embodiment, prioritizes received automation settings based on one or more prioritization criteria, such as proximity of the sharing participant 102b to the receiving participant 102a, location specific information
associated with the sharing participant 102b, and/or the like.  For example, the settings module 202 may place a higher priority on security settings received from a sharing participant 102b in closer proximity to the receiving participant 102a than a
sharing participant 102b that may be located further away.  In certain embodiments, the settings module 202 may tag the data with a priority level, which may then be processed by the matching module 204, which is described below.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the automation settings apparatus 104 includes a matching module 204 configured to compare the one or more received automation settings to one or more corresponding local automation settings.  In certain embodiments, the
matching module 204 performs a one-to-one comparison between one or more automation settings received from a sharing participant 102b and one or more local automation settings associated with the receiving participant 102a.  In another embodiment, the
matching module 204 converts one or more received automation settings to a comparable format associated with one or more local automation settings.  For example, the matching module 204 may convert one or more climate control settings from Celsius to
Fahrenheit.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the matching module 204 does not compare one or more settings that have been flagged by the user.  For example, the user may not desire the temperature to be adjusted based on one or more received automation settings.  Thus,
the matching module 204 may not perform one or more settings comparisons associated with the temperature settings of the climate control system.  In another embodiment, the matching module 204 does not perform comparisons for one or more received
automation settings that do not have corresponding local automation settings.  For example, the matching module 204 may not perform a comparison for a received humidity setting of a climate control system if the local climate control system does not have
a humidity setting.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the automation settings apparatus 104 includes a regulating module 206 configured to adjust the one or more local automation settings based on the comparison of the one or more received automation settings to the one or more
corresponding local automation settings.  The regulating module 206, for example, may adjust temperature settings of a climate control system, either up or down, based on a temperature setting received from a sharing participant 102b.  For example, if
the local temperature setting is 75.degree.  F. and a received temperature setting is 76.degree.  F., the regulating module 206 may adjust the local temperature setting to 76.degree.  F. In another example, the regulating module 206 may adjust one or
more irrigation settings, such as changing the starting times for turning the lawn sprinklers on, setting the duration of the lawn sprinklers, and/or the like.  For example, if the local starting time setting is 6:30 AM, and a received starting time from
a sharing participant 102b is 5:30 AM, the regulating module 206 may adjust the local starting time to 5:30 AM.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, the regulating module 206 processes multiple received automation settings associated with a single corresponding local automation setting.  For example, the regulating module 206 may analyze multiple temperature settings
received from a plurality of sharing participants 102b to determine whether and how to adjust the local temperature setting.  In certain embodiments, the regulating module 206 may average multiple values associated with one or more received automation
settings and adjust a corresponding local automation setting to the average value.  For example, if the received temperature values from three sharing participants 102b are 71.degree.  F., 72.degree.  F., and 73.degree.  F., the regulating module 206 may
set the local temperature setting to 72.degree.  F., which is the average of the three received values.  In further embodiments, the regulating module 206 may use different methods to process multiple values associated with an automation setting and
determine an appropriate value for the corresponding local automation setting, such as determining a standard deviation, a weighted average, and/or the like.
<br/><br/> In a further embodiment, the regulating module 206 incorporates additional received information to determine whether and how to adjust the one or more local automation settings.  For example, the regulating module 206 may give more weight to
automation settings received from sharing participants 102b in close proximity to the receiving participant 102a.  Alternatively, the regulating module 206 may give more weight to automation settings received from sharing participants 102b located in
similar climate regions as the receiving participant 102a.  In some embodiments, the regulating module 206 compares the additional information associated with the received automation settings to local information, such as the local climate, regional
characteristics (such as crime rates), and/or the like.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the regulating module 206 sends a notification to a user to alert them of possible adjustments, warnings, alerts, and/or the like, associated with the one or more received automation settings.  In a simple example, the
regulating module 206 may send a text message to the user in response to adjusting the temperature of the user's home up or down.  In another example, the regulating module 206 may send a more urgent text message to the user in response to one or more
home security settings being adjusted.  The regulating module 206 may send a notification using various methods, such as SMS, automated voice message system, email, and/or the like.  In another embodiment, the regulating module 206 uses the notification
module 312, described below, to send a notification to the user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 depicts another embodiment of an apparatus 300 for optimizing automation settings using crowdsourcing.  In one embodiment, the apparatus 300 includes an automation settings apparatus 104.  The automation settings apparatus 104, in certain
embodiments, includes a settings module 202, a matching module 204, and a regulating module 206, which are substantially similar to the settings module 202, matching module 204, and regulating module 206 described with reference to FIG. 2.  The
automation settings apparatus 104, in a further embodiment, includes a proximity module 302, a location module 304, a schedule module 306, a presence module 308, a usage module 310, a notification module 312, a request module 314, and an
immediate-response module 316, which are described below.
<br/><br/> The automation settings apparatus 104, in one embodiment, includes a proximity module 302 configured to determine the geographic proximity to a sharing participant 102b.  The sharing participant 102b, in certain embodiment, is associated with
the one or more received automation settings.  In some embodiments, the one or more local automation settings are adjusted according to the geographic proximity, as determined by the proximity module 302.  For example, automation settings received from a
physically closer sharing participant 102b may be given priority by the regulating module 206 over automation settings received from a different sharing participant 102b that may not be as physically close to the receiving participant 102a.
<br/><br/> The proximity module 302, in some embodiments, assigns a rank, weighting, and/or the like, to the one or more automation settings associated with a sharing participant 102b according to the determined geographic proximity between a receiving
participant 102a and a sharing participant 102b.  For example, the proximity module 302 may assign a higher rank to the automation settings associated with a sharing participant 102b that is in close proximity to the receiving participant 102a, such that
the regulating module 206 may incorporate higher ranked settings more than lower ranked settings because it is likely more relevant to the location of the receiving participant 102a.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, a potential break-in at the location of a sharing participant 102b may cause the sharing participant 102b to broadcast security settings to one or more receiving participants 102a.  The proximity module 302 may
determine the proximity of the sharing participant 102b to the receiving participant 102a to determine whether the regulating module 206 associated with the receiving participant 102a should adjust one or more local security settings in response to the
received security settings.  If the sharing participant 102b is not within a predetermined proximity to the receiving participant 102a, as determined by the proximity module 302, then the regulating module 206 may not adjust any local security settings. 
On the other hand, if the proximity module 302 determines the sharing participant 102b is within close proximity to the receiving participant 102a, the regulating module 206 may adjust one or more local security settings associated with the receiving
participant 102a.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the automation settings apparatus 104 includes a location module 304 configured to receive location specific data associated with the one or more sharing participants 102.  For example, the location module 304 may
determine location specific data associated with climate control settings, such as exterior temperatures, weather patterns, precipitation, humidity levels, and/or the like, for both the sharing participant 102b and the receiving participant 102a.  The
matching module 204 may incorporate the location specific data when comparing the one or more received automation settings with one or more local automation settings to determine whether the regulating module 206 should adjust the one or more local
automation settings based on the received automation settings.
<br/><br/> For example, a receiving participant 102a that receives one or more climate control system settings from a sharing participant 102b that is located in a similar climate region as the receiving participant's 102a may adjust one or more local
climate control system settings in response to the location module 304 determining the location specific data of the sharing participant 102b is similar to the receiving participant 102a.  On the other hand, a receiving participant 102a may ignore one or
more received climate control settings in response to the location module 304 determining the sharing participant 102b is located in a dissimilar climate region, and, thus, does not share many location specific characteristics as the receiving
participant 102a.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the regulating module 206 incorporates location specific information received by the location module 304 to schedule local settings adjustments in the future.  For example, location specific information received by the
location module 304 from a sharing participant 102b that is not located in a similar climate region as the receiving participant 102a may be used to schedule climate control system settings in the future.  The location module 304 may use location
specific information received from a plurality of sharing participants 102b to calculate such things as weather patterns, which may be used to set future local automation settings.  In another example, the location module 304 may receive security
information from a plurality of sharing participants 102b, such as a string of break-ins within a neighborhood, to determine whether the break-ins are getting closer to the receiving participant's 102a location.  If so, the regulating module 206 may
react by adjusting one or more local security settings.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the automation settings apparatus 104 includes a schedule module 306 configured to receive data associated with the one or more sharing participants 102b.  In certain embodiments, the data comprises information associated with
a schedule of a sharing participant 102b and may be used by the regulating module 206 to adjust one or more local automation settings.  For example, if a user associated with a sharing participant 102b has not disabled their security system for a
predefined amount of time (e.g., a week, a month, or the like), the schedule module 306 may determine that the user is on vacation and alert the regulating module 206 to possibly increase one or more local security settings because the out-of-town user's
house may be a target of a security breach.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the regulating module 206 uses the schedule information collected by the schedule module 306 to determine whether one or more local automation settings should be adjusted according to the automation settings received from
the sharing participant 102b.  For example, if a user associated with a sharing participant 102b sets the temperature of their climate control system to 75.degree.  F. for the duration of their vacation (e.g., 2 weeks), the regulating module 206 may not
consider the climate data received from this sharing participant 102b in response to the schedule module 306 determining the user is out-of-town and not actively using their climate control system.
<br/><br/> The automation settings apparatus 104, in a further embodiment, includes a presence module 308 configured to determine the presence of one or more sharing participants 102b and receive presence data associated with the one or more sharing
participants 120b.  In certain embodiments, the presence data comprises information associated with the presence of a sharing participant 102b.  In one embodiment, the regulating module 206 associated with the receiving participant 102a adjusts one or
more local automation settings in response to the presence module 308 determining the presence of the user and/or a user's pet.
<br/><br/> For example, if the presence module 308 determines that a user is home, the regulating module 206 associated with the receiving participant 102a may use this information to give a higher rank/weight to received climate control settings
associated with the sharing participant 102b because the user may be actively using their climate control system.  On the other hand, if the presence module 308 determines the user is not home, the regulating module 206 associated with the receiving
participant 102a may adjust one or more local security settings because the user's home may be a target of a security breach.  In this example, the regulating module 206 may use the presence data received by the presence module 308 together with the
proximity data determined by the proximity module 302 to determine whether and/or how to adjust the local security settings.  The presence data, in certain embodiments, may also be used by the schedule module 306 to determine the schedule of the user
associated with the sharing participant 102b.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, the presence module 308 establishes the presence of a sharing participant 102b in response to a user entering a passcode at a control panel, such as a security system control panel, a climate control system control panel,
and/or the like.  In another embodiment, the presence module 308 establishes the presence of a sharing participant 102b in response to sensing the opening of an entryway, such as a door, window, or the like.  In a further embodiment, the presence module
308 receives audio and/or video signals to establish a sharing participant 102b is present.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, the automation settings apparatus 104 includes a usage module 310 configured to receive energy usage data associated with the one or more sharing participants 102b.  In certain embodiments, the energy usage data received
by the usage module 310 is used by the regulating module 206 associated with receiving participant 102a to determine whether and/or how to adjust one or more local automation settings.  For example, the usage module 310 may determine that climate control
systems of sharing participants 102b within close proximity to the receiving participant 102a are two degrees cooler during peak hours, in which electricity is the most expensive, than the receiving participant 102a and may notify the regulating module
206 to adjust one or more local climate control settings accordingly.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the energy usage data includes water usage, broadband usage, gas usage, and/or any other measureable resource that is consumed by a participant 102.  In certain embodiments, the usage module 310 alerts a user, such as by
sending a text message, an email, and/or the like, of the current energy usage of the user's automated system and the usage data of the surrounding sharing participants 102b.  The usage module 310, in some embodiments, creates forecasts and reports that
are sent to the user associated with the usage module 310.  The forecasts and reports may contain cost information, comparative statistics based on sharing participants 102b within close proximity to the user, and/or the like.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the automation settings apparatus 104 includes a notification module 312 configured to send a notification to a sharing participant 102b in response to modification of the one or more local automation settings associated
with the sharing participant 102b.  For example, after the regulating module 206 adjusts one or more local automation settings, the notification module 312 may notify the sharing participant 102b that one or more local automation settings were adjusted. 
Thus, in one example, if the regulating module 206 adjusts one or more local climate control settings, such as turning the temperature down, the notification module 312 may notify the owner/user of the temperature change.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the notification module 312 sends notifications using text messages, emails, automated voice recordings, and/or the like.  In other embodiments, a user customizes the notifications sent by the notification module 312, such
as the content of the notification, the types of notifications to receive, how to receive the notifications, and/or the like.  For example, a user may not want to receive notifications in response to the regulating module 206 adjusting the temperature of
the climate control system.  However, the user may want to receive any notifications associated with changes in the user's security system settings.  Thus, the user may have the ability to specify what kinds of notifications to receive.
<br/><br/> The automation settings apparatus 104, in one embodiment, includes a request module 314 configured to invite one or more non-participants having one or more shareable automation settings to share the one or more shareable automation settings
with the one or more sharing participants 102b.  The request module 314 may send an invitation to a non-participant using a variety of communication methods, such as a social network (e.g., Facebook.RTM., Twitter.RTM., and/or the like), email, text
message, and/or the like.  In another embodiment, the request module 314 sends an invitation to a non-participant using a smart automation device, such as a smart climate control system, smart security system, and/or the like.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the automation settings apparatus 104 includes an immediate-response module 316 configured to receive immediate-response data from one or more sharing participants 102b.  In some embodiments, the immediate-response data
comprises information associated with one or more events associated with one or more sharing participants 102b, such as a broken window, a power outage, an alarm system being set-off, and/or the like.  For example, if the home of a sharing participant
102b experiences a broken window, which may indicate a potential break-in, the security system associated with the sharing participant 102b may broadcast data associated with the potential break-in, which may include event specific data about the broken
window (e.g., time the window was broken, the status of other entryways, and/or the like).  The immediate-response module 316 associated with the receiving participant 102a may immediately increase one or more local security settings, such as turning on
exterior lights, notifying local authorities and/or the user/owner, and/or the like, in response to receiving immediate-response data associated with the broken window.  In one embodiment, the immediate-response module 316 immediately adjusts the one or
more local automation settings without the matching module 204 comparing the received immediate-response data to one or more local automation settings.  Thus, the local automation system may react without additional processing to determine whether it
should react.  In certain embodiments, the adjustment module 206 immediately adjusts the one or more local automation settings in response to receiving immediate-response data.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 depicts one embodiment 400 of using location information to optimize automation settings.  In the depicted embodiment, house `A` 402 may be the receiving participant 102a.  Houses `B`-`F` 404-412 may be sharing participants 102b sharing
one or more automation settings with house `A` 402.  The location module 304 may receive location information for each of houses `B`-`F` 404-412, which may be processed by the matching module 204 and/or the regulating module 206 in order to determine
whether the received automation settings associated with the location information should be considered.
<br/><br/> For example, climate control information from house `E` 410 would probably not be processed by the regulating module 206 associated with house `A` 402 because of the climate differences between where house `E` 410 and house `A` 402 are located. 
However, the regulating module 206 associated with house `A` 402 may process location information associated with house `B` 404 because of the similarities in the climate regions between the locations of house `A` 402 and house `B` 404.  Alternatively,
the location module 304 may store location information associated with houses `C`-`F` 406-412 for future reference by the regulating module 206 if they location information may help determine future events, such as weather patterns, or the like.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 depicts one embodiment 500 of using proximity information to optimize automation settings.  In the depicted embodiment, a proximity area 502 is established around house `A` 504, which may determine the received automation settings to be
processed by the regulating module 206 associated with house `A` 504.  In one embodiment, the proximity module 302 establishes the proximity area 502 and may increase or decrease the proximity area 502 as desired by the user.  In certain embodiments,
automation settings received by the settings module 202 will not be considered by the matching module 204 and/or the regulating module 206 unless they are received from a sharing participant 102b within the proximity area 502.
<br/><br/> In one example, one or more security settings received from house `B` 506 may be given more weight than one or more security settings received from house `C` 508 because house `B` 506 is within the proximity area 502 of house `A` 504.  Thus, if
house `B` 506 experiences a break-in and the security system associated with house `B` 506 broadcasts a potential break-in, the security system of house `A` 504 may immediately respond by increasing its security settings (e.g., turning interior/exterior
lights on, alerting local authorities, and/or the like) in response to the potential break-in. On the other hand, if the security system associated with house `C` 508 broadcasts a potential break-in, the security system associated with house `A` 504 may
not respond immediately, if at all, because house `C` is not within the proximity area 502 established by the proximity module 302.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 depicts one embodiment of a method 600 for optimizing automation settings using crowdsourcing.  In one embodiment, the method 600 begins and a settings module 202 receives 602 one or more automation settings from one or more sharing
participants 102b In certain embodiments, a matching module 204 compares 604 the received automation settings to one or more local automation settings.  In a further embodiment, a regulating module 206 adjusts 606 the one or more local automation
settings based on the comparison of the one or more received automation settings to the one or more corresponding local automation settings and the method 600 ends.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 depicts another embodiment of a method 700 for optimizing automation settings using crowdsourcing.  In one embodiment, the method 700 begins and a settings module 202 receives 702 one or more automation settings from one or more sharing
participants 102b.  In certain embodiments, the one or more automation settings include climate control settings, security system settings, irrigation settings, home entertainment settings, and/or the like.  In another embodiment, a matching module 204
compares 704 the received automation settings to one or more local automation settings.  In certain embodiments, the matching module 204 formats one or more received automation settings such that the matching module 204 can perform a one-to-one
cross-comparison of the received automation settings and the local automation settings.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, a regulating module 206 adjusts 706 one or more local automation settings based on the comparison of the one or more received automation settings to the one or more corresponding local automation settings.  For example,
the regulating module 206 may adjust the temperature of a local climate control system in response to receiving a temperature setting from a sharing participant 102b that is different than the local temperature setting.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, the regulating module 206 incorporates additional data associated with the sharing participants 102b.  In one embodiment, the regulating module 206 incorporates 708 proximity data as determined by a proximity module 302. 
For example, received automation settings from a sharing participant 102b within close proximity to the receiving participant 102a may be given more weight than automation settings received from a sharing participant 102b that is not within close
proximity to the receiving participant 102a.
<br/><br/> In a further embodiment, the regulating module 206 incorporates 710 location data as determined by a location module 304.  In some embodiments, location data includes climate characteristics, crime characteristics, and/or the like.  For example,
a climate settings received from a sharing participant 102b within a similar climate region as the receiving participant 102a may be given more emphasis than climate settings received from a sharing participant 102b not within a similar climate region as
the receiving participant 102a.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the regulating module 206 incorporates 712 data associated with the schedule of a sharing participant 102b as determined by a schedule module 306.  For example, the receiving participant 102a may increase its local
security settings in response to the schedule module 306 determining that a sharing participant 102b within close proximity to a receiving participant 102a is not home, which may make their home a higher risk target for a potential break-in.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the regulating module 206 incorporates 714 presence data as determined by a presence module 308.  The presence module 308 may determine whether a home owner, pet, employee, or the like, is present in the location associated
with the sharing participant 102b.  If not, the receiving participant 102a may take action in response to determining the sharing participant 102b is not present.  For example, the regulating module 206 associated with the receiving participant 102a may
increase one or more local security settings in response to the presence module 308 determining the sharing participant 102b is not present.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, the regulating module 206 incorporates 716 usage data as determine by a usage module 304.  In certain embodiments, the usage data may include electricity usage, water usage, gas usage, broadband usage, and/or the like of
one or more sharing participants 102b.  The regulating module 206 may adjust one or more local automation settings in order to keep local usage consistent with one or more sharing participant's 102b usage.  Alternatively, the regulating module 206 may
notify the receiving participant 102a of their usage rate compared to one or more sharing participants 102b.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a notification module 312 sends 718 a notification to a participant 102 in response to one or more local automation settings being changed by the regulating module 206.  For example, the notification module 312 may send a text
message, email, automated voice recording, Facebook.RTM.  message, and/or the like, to the receiving participant 102a in response to the regulating module 206 adjusting the temperature of the climate control system.  The notification may include
information regarding the temperature change, such as the temperature before and after the change, the average temperature of one or more sharing participants 102b, and or the like.  The method 700 ends.
<br/><br/> Embodiments may be practiced in other specific forms.  The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive.  The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather
than by the foregoing description.  All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.
