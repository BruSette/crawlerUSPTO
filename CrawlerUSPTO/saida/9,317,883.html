predefined criteria.  Information on the predefined number of startup projects may be placed on an online resource for online fund raising via contributions from the audience.  In some embodiments, the pre-selected startup projects may receive crowd
funding and advice from mentors associated with the system 200.
<br/><br/> Based on the contributions, the processor 210 may determine eligible startup projects for TV show for each of the countries associated with the system 200.  Advertising materials associated with the eligible startup projects may be received by
the processor 210 from the startup creator or a team associated with the system 200.  The advertising materials may include one or more video recordings, one or more audio recording, photos, financial reports, and so forth.  The video recordings
including audition episodes performed by the group of venture capitalists and private investors
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the processor 210 may receive assessment of the eligible startup projects from a group of venture capitalists and private investors.  The assessment may be processed by the processor 210 separately for each country.  The assessment
may include a plurality of marks from each of the group of venture capitalists and private investors.  The marks may be awarded after various time periods, for example, each week, each month, each quarter, each year, and so forth.  Additionally, the
assessment may include investments and votes of the audience, the votes being provided via SMS, online resources, phone calls, mobile applications, social networks, and so forth.  Based on the assessment, intermediate awards may be periodically provided. Furthermore, some of the eligible startup projects may be periodically eliminated from the TV show based on the assessment.  For example, total amounts of marks associated with each of the eligible startup project may be periodically compared and the
projects with the least total amounts of marks may be excluded from the TV show.
<br/><br/> Finally, a country winning startup project may be determined for each country.  Country winning startup projects may then be promoted to an international TV show for international competition.  The international TV show may be broadcasted at
least in the countries associated with the system 200.
<br/><br/> The international TV show may repeat the procedure of the country-level show with an international group of investors.  As a result of the international TV show, the processor 210 may determine a world winning startup project and award a prize
amount to the world winning startup project.
<br/><br/> The information associated with the startup projects may be stored in the database 220 and may be accessible for members of the audience via a web-site, application, or newsletters associated with the system 200.  The database 220 may be further
configured to store the information related to startup creators, contributions, and so forth.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating a method 300 for venture capital raising for startup via award and reality TV show, in accordance with some example embodiments.  The method 300 may be performed by logic that may comprise hardware (e.g.,
dedicated logic, programmable logic, and microcode), software (such as software run on a general-purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both.  In one example embodiment, the processing logic resides at the system 200 for
venture capital raising, and the various elements of the system 200 can perform the method 300.  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill that examples of the foregoing modules may be virtual, and instructions said to be executed by a module may,
in fact, be retrieved and executed by software.  Although various elements may be configured to perform some or all of the various operations described herein, fewer or more elements may be provided and still fall within the scope of various embodiments.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 3, the method 300 may commence at operation 302 with receiving information associated with a plurality of startup projects.  The startup project may include a product, a service, and a business and may be associated with a
startup creator.  The information may be received through a user interface of the system 200 via network or otherwise.
<br/><br/> At operation 304, the system 200 may pre-select a predefined number of startup projects based on predefined criteria, such as, for example, a maximum allowed target amount for the online fund raising, minimum age of the startup creator, an
execution period for the startup project, country, and so forth.
<br/><br/> At operation 306, the pre-selected startup projects are provided for the online fund raising via an online resource.  The information associated with the pre-selected startup projects may be provided on the online resource available for
audience.  Additionally, the startup creators may provide further information on the project development via the online resource.  The audience may review the information and make contributions (for example, money transfer) for a specific startup
project.  In some embodiments, the system 200 may assign mentors to the pre-selected startup projects.  The mentors may advise the startup creators on project development, promotion, presentation, and so forth.
<br/><br/> At operation 308, the contributions may be received from the audience via the online resource.  The aim of fund raising via the online resource is to identify the projects attractive for the audience and to collect an initial amount for their
development.  When a set number of startup projects reach the target amount, these projects may be determined as eligible at operation 310.  Each of the eligible startup projects receive a total amount of contributions received in connection with that
project.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the startup creators associated with the eligible startup projects provide advertising materials related to their projects.  The advertising materials may include video, audio, photo and/or graphical information reflecting project
progress and reporting the use of the contributions.  The advertising materials may be prepared by the startup creator and/or a team associated with the system 200.  At operation 312, the eligible startup projects may be advertised on a TV show on a
country level.  The advertising includes broadcasting of at least the advertising materials on television, radio, online resources, and so forth.  Similar TV shows may be broadcasted in different countries with different projects associated with that
country.  In each country, the eligible projects may be assessed by a group of venture capitalists and private investors at operation 314.  Additionally, the assessment may include votes of the audience, the votes being provided via SMS, online
resources, phone calls, mobile applications, social networks, and so forth.  The assessment may be performed periodically (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, and so forth).  Based on the assessment, intermediate awards may be provided to certain startup
projects.  For example, intermediate awards may include a people's choice award, the venture capitalists and private investors' award, best mark award, and so forth.  Periodically, some of the startup projects may be eliminated from the TV show based on
the assessment.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a startup project that is eliminated is sold to public, the sale including a direct sale, a sale via an auction, a delayed sale, and a sale with payment by installments.  The sale may be performed using a mobile and wearable
device, which is located on a human body (e.g. a wrist, an arm, a neck, a head, a leg, a waist, an ear, a finger, and any other part of the human body).  The mobile and wearable device may be associated with one or more of a transactional payment based
on Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Short Message Service (SMS), direct operator billing, a credit card mobile payment, an online wallet, a QR code payment, contactless near field communication payment, a cloud-based mobile payment, an
audio signal-based payment, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal beacon payment, an in-application payment, an SDK payment, an API payment, a social networking payment, and a direct carrier, bank co-operation, and so forth.
<br/><br/> Access to the device may be controlled by one or more of the following: a password, a Personal Identification Number (PIN) code, and biometric authorization, the biometric authorization including fingerprint scanning, palm scanning, face
scanning, and retina scanning.  In some embodiment, the scanning is performed using the one or more biometric sensors (e.g., sensors for measuring a blood pressure, a pulse, a heart rate, a glucose level, a body temperature, an environment temperature,
arterial properties).  The measuring may be shown on the display.  The device may also include a fingerprint reader configured to scan a fingerprint.  The scanned fingerprint may be matched to one or more approved fingerprints.  Access to the wearable
personal digital is granted based on the matching.
<br/><br/> At operation 316, country winning startup projects may be selected for each of the countries where the country-level TV shows are broadcasted.  At operation 318, the country winning startup projects may be advertised on an international TV show
on an international level.  The country winning startup projects may receive international assessment at operation 320.  Based on the international assessment, a world winning project may be determined at operation 322.  For example, the project which
has received a higher assessment than other country winning projects may be determined a world wining startup project.  The world winning startup project may be awarded a prize amount at operation 324.  The prize amount may be transferred to an account
associated with the world winning startup project.

competition.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating an example representation of country-level competition 500, in accordance with certain embodiments.  The eligible startup projects 504, 508, 512 associated with country A may be promoted via TV show 518. 
The TV show 518 may be an interactive, competitive fundraising program where startup creators 502, 506, 510 present their startup projects 504, 508, 512 and describe the progress they reached with the received contributions amount.  Each of the startup
creators 502, 506, 510 may provide advertising materials 516 related to one of the startup projects 504, 508, 512 associated with him.  The advertising materials 516 associated with the startup ideas 504, 508, 512 may be provided to the audience 522 via
television broadcasting, a public demonstration, a radio broadcasting, an online broadcasting, and so forth.  For example, the startup projects 504, 508, 512 may be presented via social networks (e.g. <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Google+, and so forth), demonstrations of
the startup projects 504, 508, 512 may be posted on YouTube, product descriptions may be posted in online shops (e.g. Amazon, Ebay, Walmart, and so forth).
<br/><br/> Venture capitalists and private investors 514 may take part in the TV show 518.  They communicate with the startup creators 502, 506, 510, review the advertising materials 516 and give assessment 522 of the eligible startup projects 504, 508,
512 and their success.  The advertising materials 516 may include a startup creator presentation associated with a startup project.  The startup creator presentation may be performed weekly or monthly.  The venture capitalists and private investors 514
and/or a panel of judges may criticize the startup projects 504, 508, 512 and their presentations made by the startup creators 502, 508, 510.  Additionally, the venture capitalists and private investors 514 may provide a pre-investment amount to one or
more of the startup projects 504, 508, 512 at own discretion.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, an initial stage of the TV show may include "blind auditions," where the venture capitalists and private investors 514 may face away from the startup creators 502, 508, 510 making the presentation and towards the audience
during the startups creator performances and demos.  One of the venture capitalists and private investors 514 who is interested in the presentation presses his button, which turns their chair toward the startups owner and illuminates the bottom of the
chair to read "I invest in you" and at the same time the investment amount and team name of the startup shows on the display of the back of the chair that is turned towards the audience which the startups owner cannot see.  That means that the interested
venture capitalist accepts the startup project for mentoring.  Several venture capitalists may accept the same startup project for mentoring, then the startup creator chooses one of them.  The system 200 receive results of the blind auditions and a
choice of startup creators who received acceptance from several venture capitalists.  The accepted startup projects pass to semifinal competition.  In some embodiments, the blind audition may take place in different cities of the countries associated
with the system.
<br/><br/> From the semifinal onwards the contestants perform their demonstrations live.  Judges may criticize each performance.  The contestants may be voted for by the audience, and the outcome of the public votes is then revealed in the results show
typically on the following night.  The results shows feature group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers.  At a finale show, the winner of the TV show may be determined.  In the final live performance phase of the competition,
startup creators may perform in weekly shows, where investments and contributions narrow to a final group of startups.  The world winning project may be selected among the final group.
<br/><br/> During further rounds of the TV show, the mentor advise the startup creator on application of the investments.  Invited celebrity guests may assist the mentor in this task.  Different celebrity guests may participate in different rounds of the
TV show.
<br/><br/> At the conclusion of the demonstration of presentations, a startups creator either defaults to the only investor who turned around, or selects an investor if more than one investor expressed his interest in the idea.  The venture capitalists and
private investors 514 may guide the startup creators 502, 508, 510 through the show process, mentor, give advice and support.
<br/><br/> Additionally, audience 522 may contribute to the assessment 520 through contributions.  The assessment 520 from the audience 522 includes SMS votes, phone calls, online votes, and so forth.  Based on the assessment 520, 522, some of the startup
projects 504, 508, 512 may be considered failed and drop out of the TV show.  The rest of the startup projects 504, 508, 512 may continue competition.  Finally, after several round of presenting the advertising materials 516 and assessment 520, 522, one
of the eligible startup projects 504, 508, 512, the assessment of which is higher than the assessment of the other projects, may be determined a country winning startup project 530.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, venture capitalists and private investors may receive a performance fee or a carried interest from the startup projects that they mentor.  The carried interest is a share of the profits of an investment that is paid to the
investor as the investment manager in excess of the amount that the manager contributes to the partnership.  As a practical matter, it is a form of performance fee that rewards the venture capitalists and private investors as manager for enhancing
performance.  Furthermore, one or more of the group of venture capitalists and private investors may invest their own money in one or more of the eligible startup projects and receive return on the investment.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating an example representation of international competition 600, in accordance with certain embodiments.  Country winning startup projects 604, 608, 612 presented by their creators 602, 606, 610 may compete on
an international level.  Each of the country winning startup projects 604, 608, 612 may be associated with a specific country.  For example, project 604 may be associated with country A, project 608--country B, and so forth.  Advertising materials 616
associated with the country winning startup projects 604, 608, 612 may be presented and assessed in a way similar to a country-level competition with an international venture capitalists and private investors 614 providing an international assessment.
<br/><br/> At some stages of the TV show 618, the fate of the startup projects 604, 608, 612 may be decided by public vote, the amount of investment received, and/or the quantity of products sold.  As a part of international assessment 622, the audience
622 may make contributions 620 to the startup projects 604, 608, 612 of their choice.  Contributions 620 may be received via one or more of the following: an SMS service, an online transaction, a phone service, a social network, a banking operation, a
barcode scanning from a mobile device of a person, and so forth.  An amount of the contributions 620 associated with each startup project 604, 608, 612 may be evaluated.  The contribution amounts may be compared to determine the startup projects 604,
608, 612 that attract the least amount of contributions 620.  Such startup projects may be considered failed and drop out of the international TV show.  The drop out procedure may periodically repeat and, finally, a world winning startup project 630
which received the highest international assessment 622 and the biggest amount of the contributions 620 may be determined.  This process may be limited in time, thus determining a world winning startup project 630 may be based on a month, season or year
round time.  The world winning startup project 630 may be awarded a prize amount.
<br/><br/> The startup projects 604, 608, 612 which received a lower assessment and/or a lower amount of the contributions 620 may be considered failed.  In some embodiments, failed startup projects may be sold to public.  The sale may include a direct
sale, a sale via an auction, a delayed sale, a sale with payment by installments, and so forth.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the TV show may generate income through sales of television advertisements, merchandise, concert tickets, additional sponsorship, and so forth.  Sponsors may receive a variety of promotions of their products on the show such
as product placement, adverts, product promotions integrated into the show, various promotional opportunities, and the like.  For example, a logotype of one or more products associated with the sponsor may be displayed during the reality show on a table
of the judges; the owners may be shown in premises including a logotype or one or more products associated with the sponsors.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the winner and/or other startup creators may be required to pass a predefined amount or a percentage of the received prize amount to the system 200 for the promotion, publicity and advertisement.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, third party advertisements may be displayed at various steps of the reality show crowdsourcing.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, startups products and services may be displayed in a theme park to have show ticketing fee.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 shows a diagrammatic representation of a computing device for a machine in the exemplary electronic form of a computer system 700, within which a set of instructions for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies
discussed herein can be executed.  In various exemplary embodiments, the machine operates as a standalone device or can be connected (e.g., networked) to other machines.  In a networked deployment, the machine can operate in the capacity of a server or a
client machine in a server-client network environment, or as a peer machine in a peer-to-peer (or distributed) network environment.  The machine can be a personal computer (PC), a tablet PC, a set-top box (STB), a cellular telephone, a digital camera, a
portable music player (e.g., a portable hard drive audio device, such as an Moving Picture Experts Group Audio Layer 3 (MP3) player), a web appliance, a network router, a switch, a bridge, or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions
(sequential or otherwise) that specify actions to be taken by that machine.  Further, while only a single machine is illustrated, the term "machine" shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set (or
multiple sets) of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.
<br/><br/> The example computer system 700 includes a processor or multiple processors 702, a hard disk drive 704, a main memory 706 and a static memory 708, which communicate with each other via a bus 710.  The computer system 700 may also include a
network interface device 712.  The hard disk drive 704 may include a computer-readable medium 720, which stores one or more sets of instructions 722 embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein.  The
instructions 722 can also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory 706 and/or within the processors 702 during execution thereof by the computer system 700.  The main memory 706 and the processors 702 also constitute
machine-readable media.
<br/><br/> While the computer-readable medium 720 is shown in an exemplary embodiment to be a single medium, the term "computer-readable medium" should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database,
and/or associated caches and servers) that store the one or more sets of instructions.  The term "computer-readable medium" shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding, or carrying a set of instructions for execution by
the machine and that causes the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present application, or that is capable of storing, encoding, or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such a set of instructions.  The term
"computer-readable medium" shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, optical and magnetic media.  Such media can also include, without limitation, hard disks, floppy disks, NAND or NOR flash memory, digital video
disks, RAM, ROM, and the like.
<br/><br/> The exemplary embodiments described herein can be implemented in an operating environment comprising computer-executable instructions (e.g., software) installed on a computer, in hardware, or in a combination of software and hardware.  The
computer-executable instructions can be written in a computer programming language or can be embodied in firmware logic.  If written in a programming language conforming to a recognized standard, such instructions can be executed on a variety of hardware
platforms and for interfaces to a variety of operating systems.  Although not limited thereto, computer software programs for implementing the present method can be written in any number of suitable programming languages such as, for example, C, C++, C#
or other compilers, assemblers, interpreters or other computer languages or platforms.
<br/><br/> Thus, various systems and methods for venture capital raising for startup via award and reality TV show have been described.  Although embodiments have been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that
various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the system and method described herein.  Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather
than a restrictive sense.
