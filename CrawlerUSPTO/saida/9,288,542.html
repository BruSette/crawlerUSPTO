       <p> A content manager initiates play back of corresponding content on a
     display screen. The corresponding content is received on a primary
     broadcast channel selected amongst multiple available channels. During
     play back of the corresponding content, the content manager receives
     selection of over-the-top content available over a secondary channel with
     respect to the primary broadcast channel. The over-the-top content
     includes supplemental content associated with the corresponding content.
     In response to receiving the selection of over-the-top content, the
     content manager: i) retrieves the over-the-top content, and ii) initiates
     play back of the over-the-top content on the display screen. Accordingly,
     the user can selectively retrieve and play back supplemental content
     associated with a primary broadcast channel.

<br/><br/> In accordance with conventional television technology, cable network subscribers can tune to any of multiple broadcast and/or video on demand channels to select from multiple different television programs available on a shared communication
link.  For example, via input to a conventional set-top box, any of one or more subscribers can select and tune to the CNN.TM.  (Cable News Network.TM.) channel to view a news program; the one or more subscribers can select and tune to the ESPN.TM. 
(Entertainment and Sports Programming Network) channel to view sports events; and so on.  Thus, via selection of a respective television channel, a subscriber is able to select and play back many different types of scheduled or video on demand type of
content.
<br/><br/> In certain instances, a content sponsor assigned to a respective cable network channel may wish to make additional content available to a subscriber.  The content may be interactive or custom in nature and/or may not lend itself to be
transmitted in a standard broadcast in a video on demand or scheduled time slot.  For example, in addition to making content available on a standard television channel, the content sponsor such as CNN.TM.  may establish one or more different websites
from which additional content (e.g., statistics, stock reports, business information, etc.) is available for viewing in an interactive manner by a subscriber.
<br/><br/> In most situations, a user plays back broadcasted or video on demand content from a content sponsor on a display screen such as a television set (e.g., a large screen television).  To view custom web content available from a respective content
provider, the user typically must log on to a device other than the television set such as a respective computer, open a browser on the computer, and input the appropriate network address to the browser to retrieve the additional content.  In this
manner, via a computer device located at a disparate location with respect to the user's television, a subscriber can retrieve so-called over-the-top content to view additional content available from, for example, a CNN.TM.  website.
<br/><br/> Conventional technology includes so-called widgets (i.e., applications) that enable display of retrieved content on a display screen.  For example, a subscriber can initiate execution of a weather widget via a respective set-top box.  The
weather widget retrieves information such as current weather conditions.  The subscriber can activate a widget by viewing a listing of available widgets and then selecting a particular widget amongst the list for execution.  When executed, the widget
enables a respective subscriber to retrieve data such as display information and initiate display of the display information on a display screen.
<br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> Conventional techniques of accessing content from different sources suffer from deficiencies.  For example, it is often inconvenient for a user watching a television program on a respective television screen to switch over to use of a home
computer in another room to view further information about the television program or selected channel from a corresponding content sponsor.
<br/><br/> Embodiments herein are useful over conventional techniques.  For example, embodiments herein enable a user such as a cable network subscriber to more easily retrieve and play back supplemental content associated with a content sponsor,
television program, television channel, etc. In certain instances, embodiments herein enable a user to have a more interactive experience with respect to viewing content available from multiple sources.
<br/><br/> More specifically, one embodiment herein includes receiving a request to display a content guide of available content.  In response to receiving the request, a processing resource initiates display of the content guide on a display screen.  In
the displayed content guide, the processing resource initiates display of multiple selectable content viewing options.  In one embodiment, a first selectable channel viewing option of the multiple content viewing options corresponds to a television
channel from which to view content originating from a content sponsor.  A second channel viewing option of the multiple content viewing options corresponds to an auxiliary channel (with respect to the television channel) providing the subscriber to
access available over-the-top content or other supplemental content associated with the content available on the television channel originating from the content sponsor.  Accordingly, via display of a content guide displaying a novel channel lineup, a
viewer can be easily notified of the availability of original content and corresponding related content available from different sources (e.g., a television channel and an auxiliary channel supporting retrieval of over-the-top content).
<br/><br/> By further way of a non-limiting example, the channel lineup (i.e., channels of available content to a subscriber) can include a first content viewing option specifying a standard television from which to view scheduled or video on demand
television programs.  The second content viewing option (potentially displayed adjacent to the first content viewing option) in the channel lineup enables a respective subscriber to retrieve supplemental content such as over-the-top content associated
with the television program and/or television channel.  Via selection of the different content viewing options on a display screen, a viewer is able to more easily select retrieval of main content and supplemental content from multiple different sources.
<br/><br/> Further embodiments herein can include receiving a command to view supplemental content associated with a television program while the television program is currently rendered on a display screen.  In one non-limiting example embodiment,
subsequent to and in response to receiving the command, a processing resource maps an identity of the television program to a corresponding network address from which the supplemental content such as web content associated with the television program is
retrievable.  The processing resource retrieves the supplemental content from a server resource as specified by the corresponding network address and initiates display of the supplemental content on the display screen.  Accordingly, a user can initially
select and view content in a scheduled time of a television channel.  The user can view additional content (e.g., custom or generic over-the-top content) associated with the selected television program via input of an appropriate display command.
<br/><br/> Note that display of related content is not limited to content associated with a respective television program.  For example, embodiments herein can further include rendering content received over a cable network channel on a display screen. 
The cable network channel can be assigned to distribute content originating from a particular content sponsor assigned to the cable network channel.  As an example, a business entity such as CNN.TM.  may provide the content to be broadcasted on a
corresponding assigned cable network channel.
<br/><br/> Assume in one example embodiment that a user currently viewing content on the CNN.TM.  cable network channel initiates a request to view web content associated with the CNN.TM.  cable network channel.  In one embodiment, in response to receiving
the request to access supplemental content associated with the cable network channel: a respective processing resource receiving the request maps an identity of the cable network channel currently displayed on the display screen to a network address of a
server resource from which the supplemental content associated with the selected cable network channel is retrievable.  The processing resource retrieves the supplemental content from the server resource as specified by the network address and initiates
display of the supplemental content (such as web content) on the display screen.  Accordingly, embodiments herein enable a user to easily initiate display of supplemental over-the-top content associated with a currently viewed television channel.
<br/><br/> These and more detailed embodiments are discussed below.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Now, more specifically, FIG. 1 is an example diagram illustrating a network environment according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> As shown, network environment 100 includes multiple networks including a packet-switched network 190-1, a cable network 190-2, shared network 190-3, etc. Via the different types of networks 190, respective subscribers are able to retrieve and
play back different types of content such as over-the-top content, scheduled broadcast television programs, on-demand content, etc.
<br/><br/> As its name suggests, packet-switched network 190-1 enables routing of data packets based on network address information.  By way of a non-limiting example, packet-switched network 190-1 can support client server type communications.  For
example, a client can generate a request for content from a particular server resource using an appropriate network address of the server resource.  The server resource transmits the requested content over packet-switched network 190-1 to the respective
client in a subscriber domain using the network address of the client.
<br/><br/> Cable network 190-2 supports services such as distribution of content via one or more cable television channels (e.g., QAM or quadrature amplitude modulated channels, IPTV channels, etc.) to subscribers in network environment 100.
<br/><br/> Shared network 190-3 supports final leg connectivity to subscribers or subscriber domains 150 and includes physical media such as one or more coaxial cables, optical fibers, twisted wire pairs, etc.
<br/><br/> Via distribution resources 125 (e.g., equipment such as cable modem termination systems, headend equipment, hubs, optical nodes, etc.), shared communication link 191 facilitates distribution of different types of content over shared
communication link 191 to a respective service group of multiple subscriber domains 150.  By way of a non-limiting example, a portion of bandwidth of shared communication link 191 can be allocated to broadcast content such as one or more television
channels to subscribers in respective subscriber domains 150.  Subscribers can selectively tune to the broadcasted television channels to view respective content.
<br/><br/> The bandwidth associated with shared communication link 191 can also support distribution of additional content such as video on demand content.  To retrieve such content, a subscriber generates a request for desired content.  The distribution
resource 125 allocates a new channel in the shared communication link 191 and transmits the requested content over the new channel.  The requesting subscriber tunes to the newly established channel to retrieve the requested on-demand content.
<br/><br/> As mentioned, content can be transmitted to the different subscribers in any suitable manner such as via QAM channels, IPTV channel, etc.
<br/><br/> As mentioned, shared communication link 191 can be configured to support distribution of so-called over-the-top content.  For example, a portion of bandwidth in shared communication link 191 can support data channels in accordance with DOCSIS
(Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) or any other suitable communication standard.  Via the data channels, each of the subscribers can retrieve over-the-top content from respective server sources disposed in packet-switched network 190-1
such as the Internet.
<br/><br/> An additional portion of the bandwidth of shared communication link 191 can be allocated to support miscellaneous services such as phone services.  Thus, shared communication link 191 can support various services such as Internet access
services, cable television services, phone services, etc.
<br/><br/> In this example, subscriber domain 150-1 includes a content manager 140-1 such as a set-top box device, computer, etc. Content manager 140-1 can be any suitable type of play back device.  Subscriber domain 150-1 can be configured to include
network 174-1 such as a local area network, WiFi.TM.  network, routers, etc., facilitating distribution of data and communications to and from subscriber domain 150-1.  Interface 112-1 connects the respective subscriber domain 150-1 to shared network
190-3.  Accordingly, the subscriber domain 150-1 is able to transmit and receive data.
<br/><br/> User 108-1 resides in subscriber domain 150-1 and controls content manager 140-1 via input of commands from any of one or more controller devices 170 (e.g., controller device 170-1 such as a wireless set-top box remote controller, controller
device 170-2 as a keyboard, etc.).  The subscriber 108-1 can provide input commands to content manager 140-1 in accordance with any suitable technique.
<br/><br/> As specified by the inputted commands, the content manager 140-1 controls play back of content received on any of one or more channels of the shared communication link 191.
<br/><br/> Assume in this example that the subscriber 108-1 inputs a respective command to view content guide 250-1 on display screen 130-1.  In response to the command, the content manager 140-1 initiates retrieval of display data associated with the
content guide and displays content guide 250-1 on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> A non-limiting example of content guide 250-1 is shown in FIG. 2.  In this example embodiment, the content guide 250-1 displayed on display screen 130-1 includes a channel lineup of multiple selectable content viewing options.
<br/><br/> Certain viewing options in the displayed content guide 250-1 correspond to available television channels that can be selected by the subscriber 108-1 for viewing.  For example, assume that the current time is 7:01 pm.  Via selection window 260,
the subscriber can select channel 555 to view a drama show on television channel 555 (e.g., CBS.TM.); the user can select channel 556 to view NEWS on television channel 556 (e.g., CNN.TM.); the user can select channel 557 to view NFL GAME on television
channel 557 (e.g., ESPN.TM.); etc.
<br/><br/> By way of a non-limiting example, the selection window 260 can be navigated up, down, left, right, etc., via respective arrow buttons on the control device 170-1.  After highlighting a respective entry in content guide 250-1, the subscriber can
press an OK button or selection button on the controller device 170-1 to confirm a selection.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, embodiments herein can include: initiating display of a first channel viewing option or notification specifying playable content such as NEWS in scheduled timeslot 7:00-7:30 pm.  of channel 556 as well as initiating display of a
second channel viewing option (e.g., channel 556 WEB) specifying availability of the over-the-top content 114 via an auxiliary channel (e.g., 556 WEB) with respect to standard channel 556.
<br/><br/> To select a respective channel in content guide 250-1, the respective subscriber 108-1 can navigate selection window 260 about displayed content guide 250-1.  Subsequent to receiving selection of a respective channel in content guide 250-1, the
content manager 140-1 tunes to the appropriate selected channel 122 (such as channel 556 in this instance) and plays back corresponding broadcasted content received on channel 556.  Thus, via selection form content guide 250-1, the subscriber is able to
select amongst multiple channels for viewing.
<br/><br/> In this example embodiment, note that certain content sponsors (i.e., content providers) such as content sponsor CNN, content sponsor ESPN, etc., may produce additional content that is available over the Internet.  Content guide 250-1 includes
content viewing option 556 WEB enabling a respective user to view additional content associated with the CNN channel; content guide 250-1 includes content viewing option 557 WEB enabling a respective user to view additional content associated with the
ESPN channel; and so on.
<br/><br/> As a more specific example, each content sponsor may have a respective home page.  Via selection of channel 556 WEB via selection window 260, the subscriber 108-1 can view a home page or any other suitable content associated with content sponsor
CNN.  Via selection of channel 557 WEB via selection window, the subscriber 108-1 can view a home page or any other suitable content associated with content sponsor ESPN.
<br/><br/> The juxtaposition of displaying a respective television channel viewing option and a web channel viewing option adjacent or near each other in a content guide 250-1 is useful.  For example, a subscriber may be interested in viewing content from
a particular content sponsor such as CNN.  Via the content guide 250-1, and display of multiple selectable viewing options (e.g., a standard television channel viewing option and related web content channel viewing option), the subscriber can easily,
selectably, and efficiently view content from different sources for each of the content sponsors.  Thus, in contrast to conventional techniques, a user can view content guide 250-1 and identify more options from the same content sponsor in a channel
lineup.
<br/><br/> Referring again to FIG. 1, display screen 130-1 initiates display of the content guide 250-1.  Subscriber domain 150-1 receives one or more television channels of available content over termination branch 191-1 of shared communication link 191. 
By way of a non-limiting example, branch 191-1 is a final portion of a communication link connecting subscriber domain 150-1 to shared communication link 191.
<br/><br/> Assume in this example that content sponsor 105-1 represents content sponsor CNN.TM.  and that content 113-2 represents the NEWS program available in time slot 7:00-7:30 pm of channel 556.  By way of a non-limiting example, the content sponsor
105 provides content 113-2 to the cable network service provider.  The cable network service provider makes the content 113-2 available to subscribers.
<br/><br/> As previously discussed, when the subscriber 108-1 (i.e., user) selects channel 556 for viewing, the content manager 140-1 tunes to channel 556, decodes the corresponding content stream, and plays back a rendition of the respective content on
display screen 130-1 for viewing by the respective subscriber 108-1.  Again, channel 556 can be any suitable type of channel such as a QAM channel, IPTV channel, video on demand channel, etc.
<br/><br/> Further, as previously discussed, in certain instances, the subscriber 108-1 may wish to view alternative content 114 (i.e., supplemental content) such as over-the-top content, web content, etc., provided by or made available by the content
sponsor 105 (e.g., CNN) or any other suitable resource.  In such an instance, in response to receiving selection of channel 556 WEB, the content manager 140-1 initiates communications over a respective data channel such as data channel 123-1 (e.g., an IP
channel, Internet channel, etc.) in shared communication link 191.
<br/><br/> By way of a non-limiting example, to retrieve content 114 such as home page associated with the content sponsor CNN.TM., the content manager 140-1 produces a request message including a network address of the server resource 110-2 from which the
content 114 associated with content sponsor 105-1 is retrievable.  The content manager 140-1 communicates the request message (e.g., one or more IP data packets) through the data channel to server resource 110-2.  The content manager 140-1 decodes and
renders the content 114 (e.g., streaming video, home page, etc.) received from server resource 110-2 on display screen 130-1 for viewing by the respective subscriber 130-1.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, network environment 100 and corresponding infrastructure enables a respective content sponsor to distribute content to a respective subscriber from a number of different sources in network environment 100.  Additional details are
discussed below.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is an example diagram illustrating bandwidth allocation according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> As previously discussed, the bandwidth of the shared communication link 191 can be allocated to include one or more channels (e.g., scheduled television channels, video on demand channels, etc.).  In this example embodiment, bandwidth of shared
communication link 191 can include channels .  . . , 556, 557, 558, 559, .  . . .
<br/><br/> Assume that channel 556 includes content 113-2 from content sponsor CNN; channel 557 includes content from content sponsor ESPN; and so on.
<br/><br/> Shared communication link 191 can also include one or more data channels 123-1, 123-2, 123-3, 123-4, etc., to carry over-the-top such as IP (Internet Protocol) data traffic.  Subscribers in network environment 100 are coupled to shared
communication link 191 can share use of the data channels to retrieve web content.
<br/><br/> In this example embodiment, the content manager 140-1 includes a tuner resource 320-1.  In a manner as previously discussed, the user can select a standard television channel from which to view a broadcast of streaming video content.  In
response to receiving selection of channel 556, the content manager 140-1 sets tuner resource 320-2 to tune to channel 556.  Display manager 350-1 decodes the received data on channel 556 and renders play back of the corresponding content 113-2 on
display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> Via selection window 260, the subscriber 108-1 may also select 556 WEB.  In accordance with one embodiment, responsive to receiving selection of this channel viewing option (i.e., channel 556 WEB), the content manager 140-1 retrieves an
appropriate network address specifying the server resource 110-2 from which the content 114 (such as a home page or other type of content associated with sponsor CNN) can be retrieved.
<br/><br/> The network application 340-1 (such as a web browser or other suitable type of resource) utilizes the network address of content sponsor CNN to communicate with the server resource 110-2 over an auxiliary channel (e.g., channel 556 WEB or
channel 123-1) with respect to main channel 556.
<br/><br/> Note that in one embodiment, the network application 340-1 such as a browser can be opened or executed well before receiving a request to access corresponding web content.
<br/><br/> The network application 340-1 transmits the content request message over the auxiliary channel to retrieve display information such as content 114 generated by the content sponsor 105 or other suitable resource.  The network application 340-1
receives the display information over the auxiliary channel from the server resource 110-2.  The display manager 350-1 decodes and renders the display information (e.g., content 114) on the display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> In a similar manner, each of the subscribers in respective subscriber domains 150 of network environment 100 can retrieve and play back content from multiple different sources for a particular content provider (e.g., content sponsor).
<br/><br/> As previously mentioned, network application 340-1 can be a browser application supporting retrieval of over-the-top content.  The network application 340-1 can retrieve and transmit content (e.g., documents, web pages, video data, audio data,
images, etc.) in accordance with a communication protocol such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) HTTP or any other suitable communication protocol.  As will be further discussed below, additional displayed viewing options such as hyperlinks present
in the information displayed on display screen 130-1 enable the subscriber to navigate to other websites, retrieve different types of content, etc.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, a respective subscriber can select a standard television channel to view standard broadcast content associated with a content sponsor.  The subscriber can select an auxiliary channel to access supplemental content made available by
a respective content sponsor.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the over-the-top content available in the auxiliary channel such as 556 WEB is tied to a schedule.  For example, referring again to FIG. 2, a user has an option of selecting a respective channel to view linear content
currently broadcasted on channel 556.  In such an instance, as discussed herein, user views the currently broadcasted content when tuning to a respective channel.
<br/><br/> The content sponsor CNN or other suitable resource can produce additional linear content (such as supplemental content) that is available for viewing as over-the-top content in channel 556 WEB.  In such an instance, a respective server resource
streaming the over-the-top content on channel 556 WEB streams content to a respective user 108-1 depending on a current time of day in a similar manner that the broadcasted content in channel 556 would be transmitted.  Accordingly, the user 108-1 can
select viewing of content (such as a one or more video on demand assets) on channel 556 WEB, which may appear to the user 108-1 as broadcasted content, even though the data stream is over-the-top content.
<br/><br/> In accordance with further embodiments, if desired, the content on broadcast channel 556 and over-the-top content channel 556 WEB can be synchronized with each other to provide a selectable viewing experience.  For example, the content available
on the over-the-top content channel 556 WEB can include images of the same or substantially the matter as shown in channel 556, but at one or more different camera perspectives.
<br/><br/> Synchronization of playing back content on a primary channel (such as channel 556) and auxiliary channel (such as 556 WEB) can be achieved in any suitable manner.  For example, in one embodiment, a play back device operated by the user can be
configured to store the content broadcasted over channel 556 as it is received.  The user can change the current play back pointer in the data stream to an earlier time and play back previously stored content.  The user can change the play back pointer
to a later point in time as well to view currently received content.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, when switching between viewing content on channel 556 and channel 556 WEB, the play back device operated by the user can be configured to keep track of the current play back location in the primary channel.  When switching
over to viewing content in the secondary channel, the play back device can be configured to send time information specifying the current play back location to a respective server resource streaming content associated with channel 556 WEB.  In this
manner, if the web connection is sufficiently fast, the user 108-1 is able to content associated with the content transmitted in the primary broadcast channel.
<br/><br/> In accordance with another embodiment, if desired, both the channel 556 and channel 556 WEB can be configured to transmit related content such as different images of a same subject matter.  The user can toggle between play back of the different
channels to view the different images.
<br/><br/> One embodiment herein includes storing a combination of the content received on selected channel 556 as well as corresponding channel 556 WEB in a corresponding storage device accessible to the viewer.
<br/><br/> The content in each of the different channels can include respective time stamp information or timing information.  The timing information specifies synchronization of stored content from the primary broadcast channel to stored content in the
secondary channel.  Upon play back of the content associated with channel 556, the current location of the play back pointer in the primary channel content can be used to identify an appropriate location in the supplemental content received on the
secondary channel to play back on the display screen 130-1 if the user wishes to view the alternative content stored on channel 556 WEB.
<br/><br/> As mentioned, the supplemental content received in the secondary can be asynchronous in which the content in each channel has little or no relation to each other.
<br/><br/> Additional or alternative embodiments can include enabling a respective user to start play back of supplemental content at a beginning of a respective data stream upon request of a respective user as opposed to identifying a corresponding
intermediate location in a data stream to play back based on the previous location of playing back content received on the primary broadcast channel.
<br/><br/> Note that additional details of content management are discussed below in FIGS. 17-27 as well as corresponding text.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is an example diagram illustrating transition of displaying content received on a television channel to an auxiliary channel according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> In a manner as previously discussed, assume that the subscriber initially produces control input 405 indicating to tune to channel 556 and render corresponding content 113-2 provided by content sponsor 105 on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> Assume that during play back of respective content 113-2 received on channel 556, the subscriber 108-1 would like to switchover to viewing and/or accessing supplemental content such as web content 114 associated with channel 556.  Assume in this
example that the subscriber 108-1 provides control input 405 such as by pressing an appropriate button 425 on controller device 170-1.
<br/><br/> While rendering content 113-2 from channel 556, assume that the subscriber 108-1 presses button 425.  In response to receiving the control input 405 as a result of the button 425 being pressed, the content manager 140-1 utilizes map 465 to map
the currently viewed channel (i.e., channel 556 associated with content sponsor CNN) to a corresponding network address or URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to retrieve the corresponding supplemental content 114 for play back on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is an example diagram illustrating a map 465 according to embodiments herein.  In one embodiment, the content manager 140-1 keeps track of the currently selected channel (i.e., channel 556 in this instance).  Via map 465, the network
application 340-1 determines that supplemental web content (such as content 114) associated with channel 556 and/or content sponsor CNN can be retrieved from a URL such as CNN.COM (or corresponding unique IP network address #1).
<br/><br/> The network application 340-1 uses the identified network address and/or URL (e.g., network application #1) to obtain the supplemental content 114 from server resource 110-2.
<br/><br/> As further shown in FIG. 6, in response to receiving the command (such as depressing of button 425) to retrieve and display content 114 associated with channel 556 WEB, the display manager 350-1 switches into a mode of displaying a rendition of
retrieved supplemental content 114 (as retrieved over auxiliary channel 556 WEB by network application 340-1) in display region 620 on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> Note that FIG. 6 illustrates an example of a picture-in-picture mode in which the display manager 350-1 displays a rendition of the supplemental content 114 received from channel 556 WEB in a portion of the display screen as an overlay on top of
a rendition of content 113-2 from channel 556 as a background on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> As an alternative to displaying a picture-in-picture mode as in FIG. 6, the display manager 350-1 can be configured to discontinue playing back content 113-2 and display a rendition of supplemental content 114 over the entire field of pixels in
the display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> By further way of a non-limiting example, whether in a picture-in-picture mode or an alternating display mode (in which either a rendition of content from channel 556 is displayed or content from channel 556 WEB is displayed), if supplemental
content is associated with a respective viewed channel, note that the button 425 of controller device 170-1 can be used to toggle between playing back streaming content 113-2 received on channel 556 and playing back corresponding supplemental content
associated with the channel.
<br/><br/> More specifically, while displaying a rendition of content 113-2 on display screen 130-1 from channel 556, selection of the button 425 causes the display manager 350-1 to switch over to (alternatively or additionally) displaying a rendition of
supplemental content 114 (such as a home page or other suitable content) on display screen 130-1.  While displaying a rendition of content 114 on display screen 130-1 from an over-the-top channel such as auxiliary channel 556 WEB, selection of the button
425 can cause the display manager 350-1 to switch over to displaying a rendition of content 113-2 on display screen 130-1 again.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, in one embodiment, a user such as subscriber 108-1 can easily toggle between modes of playing back content from different sources for a particular content provider merely by repeatedly pressing the button 425.
<br/><br/> In yet further embodiments, the content 112-2 received on the main television channel (e.g., channel 556) can be recorded in a digital video recorder.  As mentioned, the subscriber 108-1 can temporarily switchover to viewing the available
supplemental web content received over the auxiliary channel (e.g., channel 556 WEB).  In response to detecting that a user switches back to viewing the main television channel again after temporarily viewing the supplemental content, the display manager
340-1 can initiate play back of stored broadcast content so that the subscriber 108-1 is able to view an entirety of the content 112-2, as opposed to skipping play back of parts of the content 112-2 due to times when the user happened to view content
received of the auxiliary channel 556 WEB.
<br/><br/> Thus, certain embodiments herein can include storing a program of currently viewed content 112-2 as received on channel 556; in response to detecting switchover to viewing content on channel 556 WEB, storing a pointer in a respective video
stream of the stored content, the pointer specifying a play back time at which the user switches over to the auxiliary channel 556 WEB; and upon switchover back to viewing the main television channel or stored content 112-2, playing back the stored
content starting at the time as specified by the pointer.  As mentioned, the subscriber is able to view a television program in its entirety even though the subscriber happens to at least temporarily switch over to viewing supplemental content associated
with a currently viewed television program or channel.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is an example diagram illustrating a rendering of over-the-top content associated with a television channel according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> As previously discussed, the user can initiate display of content associated with channel 556 WEB on display screen 130-1.  In this example embodiment, assume that the content manager 140-1 receives a request to display content associated with
channel 556 WEB.  In such an instance, the display manager 340-1 initiates display of content 114 in display region 620 as shown.
<br/><br/> The rendering of supplemental content (associated with a television program or content provider) in display region 620 can include displaying a menu of further selectable content viewing options 720 such as content viewing option 720-1, content
viewing option 720-2, content viewing option 720-3, and so on.  Each of the content viewing options 720 can correspond to further retrievable supplemental over-the-top content accessible by the subscriber 108-1.
<br/><br/> By way of a non-limiting example, the rendition of content in display region 620 may be a web home page of the CNN content sponsor.  The subscriber 108-1 can initiate selection of content viewing option 720-1 to retrieve further display
information over the auxiliary channel 556 WEB (e.g., a data channel) for viewing in display region 620 on display screen 130-1; the subscriber 108-1 can initiate selection of content viewing option 720-2 to retrieve further display information over the
auxiliary channel 556 WEB (e.g., a data channel) for viewing in display region 620 on display screen 130-1; and so on.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, embodiments herein can include initiating display of a set of selectable content viewing options 720 on the display screen 130-1 in which each of the content viewing options 720 specifies different content available for selection
and retrieval over the auxiliary channel; and in response to selection of a given content viewing option from the set of displayed content viewing options 720, initiating a communication over the auxiliary channel to a respective server resource to
retrieve content as specified by the given content viewing option.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 is an example diagram illustrating an example of another version of a content guide according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> In this example embodiment as shown, the content guide 250-2 indicates availability of corresponding web content for each of multiple different television programs as opposed to merely that web content such as a respective home page or other
supplemental content is available from a particular content sponsor.
<br/><br/> For example, as shown in FIG. 8, content guide 250-2 indicates that television program "GERALDO SHOW LIVE" supports interactive television.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, content guide 250-2 indicates that supplemental content is available from channel 567 WEB for television program "GERALDO SHOW LIVE" in timeslot between 7:00 and 8:00 pm; content guide 250-2 indicates that supplemental content
is available from channel 556 WEB for television program "LIVE INTERVIEW WITH TED TURNER" in timeslot between 8:00 and 9:00 pm; content guide 250-2 indicates that supplemental content is available from channel 567 WEB for television program "AMERICAN
IDOL" in timeslot between 9:00 and 10:00 pm; and so on.
<br/><br/> A corresponding unique network address from which to retrieve web content for a television program can be assigned to each of the programs.  For example, a first set of one or more unique network addresses from which to retrieve supplemental
content associated with the "GERALDO SHOW LIVE" can be assigned to the "GERALDO SHOW LIVE" aired in channel 567 during timeslot 7:00 to 8:00 pm.
<br/><br/> In a manner as previously discussed, a respective subscriber can tune to view a respective television program such as "GERALDO SHOW LIVE." Note that the network application 340-1 can be executing well before a time of actually initiating an
access of web content such as at or around a time of powering up the content manager 140-1 for use.  Early execution of the network application 340-1 can reduce delays of retrieving corresponding supplemental content when so requested by a subscriber.
<br/><br/> Note that display of notifications in the content guide is one way that a respective subscriber can be notified that supplemental content is available for a respective television program.  However, in one embodiment, the subscriber 108-1 may not
need to view the content guide 250-2 to learn that corresponding web content associated with a television program is available for retrieval.
<br/><br/> For example, the network application 340-1 in content manager 140-1 can be configured to monitor a current viewed channel to which tuner resource 320-1 is tuned.  The content manager 140-1 can be configured to check whether a particular selected
channel being played back on display screen 130-1 has corresponding web content available for viewing.  If so, the display manager 350-1 provides a notification to a subscriber by initiating display of a visual notification such as a symbol on the
display screen 130-1 to notify the subscriber 108-1 that web content is available for the currently selected television program.
<br/><br/> Assume in this example that the subscriber 108-1 selects the television program "GERALDO SHOW LIVE" on channel 567 for display on display screen 130-1.  In a manner as previously discussed, the tuner 320-1 tunes to channel 567 and renders the
selected television program on display screen 130-1.  While the "GERALDO SHOW LIVE" is played back by content manager 140-1, the display manager 350-1 can be configured to initiate display of a symbol in a small portion of the display screen 130-1 to
notify the subscriber 108-1 that web content associated with the displayed television program is available.
<br/><br/> Assume further in this example that the subscriber 108-1 provides input such as pressing button 425 to access the web content associated with the "GERALDO SHOW LIVE." In response to receiving a command such as a subscriber 108-1 pressing button
425 to access web content associated with the "GERALDO SHOW LIVE," the network application 340-1 accesses a respective map to identify a corresponding network address from which web content associated with the currently displayed channel can be
retrieved.  Via communications with respect to a server resource as specified by the network address, the network application 340-1 retrieves the supplemental content such as web content associated with the "GERALDO SHOW LIVE" and initiates display of
the corresponding supplemental content on the display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, a subscriber 108-1 can initially select and view content in a scheduled time of a television channel.  The user can view additional content (e.g., custom or generic over-the-top content) associated with the selected television
program via input of an appropriate display command such as pressing button 425 on control device 170-1.
<br/><br/> The communication channel (e.g., a client server channel) used by the network application 340-1 to retrieve the supplemental content can be used for a number of purposes such as interactive television.  For example, the retrieved web content can
enable a respective user to participate in a poll associated with the corresponding main television program.
<br/><br/> As previously discussed, the supplemental content facilitating interactive television can be displayed on display screen 130-1 as a picture-in-picture.  In one embodiment, via input to a poll received over channel 567 WEB and presented
picture-in-picture window on the display screen 130-1, the subscriber 108-1 can provide feedback indicating whether the subscriber believes that a male guest currently interviewed on the "GERALDO SHOW LIVE" (as captured in video received and played back
from the main channel 567) is telling the truth or not about a particular subject matter discussed several minutes earlier on the show played back on the display screen 130-1 (e.g., from channel 567).
<br/><br/> The content provider of the "GERALDO SHOW LIVE" can tally results of the poll from multiple different subscribers (as received in a similar manner via interactive television), and posts results later in the television show broadcasted on channel
567.  For example, via collection of information from different subscribers via the auxiliary channel providing web access, a data collection manager in the corresponding server resource associated with channel 567 WEB can determine that 75% of the audio
viewing the "GERALDO SHOW LIVE" and taking the poll thinks that the male guest is lying about a subject such as cheating on his girlfriend.  The corresponding content sponsor can play back the results of the poll on the show after tallying results.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, embodiments herein can include receiving feedback from multiple subscribers with respect to television program; and producing a portion of the television program viewed by the subscriber to include the feedback.
<br/><br/> Thus, a respective network application 340-1 can support two-way communications amendment interactive television.  For example, display information can be retrieved from a particular web site and displayed on display screen 130-1 as supplemental
content.  In a reverse direction, the subscriber 108-1 can input data to the respective website to participate in the television program.
<br/><br/> In accordance with yet further embodiments, the supplemental web content associated with a respective television channel can vary depending on which particular portion of the television program is being broadcasted to subscribers.  For example,
via the network application 340-1, a respective subscriber may be able to use the network application 340-1 to participate in a poll during first portion of a broadcast.  During another portion of the broadcast, via communications over a respective
auxiliary WEB channel for a program, the respective subscriber may be able to participate in the show as if they were present in the audience; and so on.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is an example diagram enabling further viewer participation in a television program according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> As shown, the subscriber domain 150-1 can be equipped with a respective camera resource 175-1 (e.g., an audio and image capturing device) to monitor the subscriber 108-1.  In one embodiment, network application 340-1 transmits the captured
images/audio to server resource 110-2 that stores the content.  The corresponding content sponsor can receive the captured images/audio and initiate play back of such content in the corresponding television program.  Accordingly, the host of "GERALDO
SHOW LIVE" can interview a subscriber 108-1 at a remote location (such as in their home) and display the results of the home interview later in the corresponding broadcasted television program.  Thus, subscribers in their respective homes can participate
in a respective television show even though they are not physically present in an audio.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 is an example diagram illustrating the ability for subscribers to communicate with other subscribers according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> As shown, each of the multiple subscriber domains 150 can be equipped with a respective camera resource.  For example, subscriber domain 150-1 can be equipped with camera resource 175-1 to capture audio/images in subscriber domain 150-1;
subscriber domain 150-2 can be equipped with camera resource 175-2 to capture audio/images in subscriber domain 150-2; and so on.
<br/><br/> Each content manager 140 in a subscriber domain can be configured to monitor play back of particular content selected for viewing by a respective subscriber.  When the subscriber tunes to a particular predetermined channel or television program,
the network application in each content manager can be configured to access management resource 110-6 to determine whether the subscriber's one or more friends also happen to be watching the same television show.  Management resource 110-6 can be
configured to keep track of which subscribers in network environment 100 are open to receiving communications from each other.  Assuming that subscriber 108-1 and subscriber 108-2 are friends with each other, in one embodiment, the management resource
110-6 communicates a message to the parties to indicate that they can communicate with each other via a video session.
<br/><br/> More specifically, assume that subscriber 108-1 and subscriber 108-2 are friends that enjoy watching football.  Assume further that management resource 110-6 keep track of the relationship between subscriber 108-1 and subscriber 108-2.  Each
content manager 140 can be configured to monitor when a respective subscriber watches a football game.
<br/><br/> By way of a non-limiting example, in response to detecting that subscriber 108-1 has tuned to channel 557 to watch the football game starting at 7:00 pm (FIG. 2), the network application 340-1 in content manager 140-1 contacts management server
110-6 to indicate that subscriber 108-1 is currently watching the football game (or particular channel).  In a similar manner, each of multiple subscribers can notify the management resource 110-6 of the corresponding channel they are watching.  In this
example, assume that subscriber 108-2 has also tuned to view the football game on channel 557.
<br/><br/> In response to detecting that subscriber 108-1 has tuned to channel 557 to watch the football game starting at 7:00 pm (FIG. 2) as well, the network application 340-1 in content manager 140-1 contacts management server 110-6 check if any friends
of subscriber 108-2 happen to be watching the same football game (or channel).  If so, the management resource 110-6 can communicate through the respective network applications to notify one or more of the subscribers (e.g., subscriber 108-1 and/or
subscriber 108-2) that a respective friend is watching the same game.
<br/><br/> Via further communications with the management resource, if both subscriber 108-1 and subscriber 108-2 are open to communications with each other, the subscriber 108-1 and subscriber 108-2 can facilitate transmission of images to each other. 
For example, the network application in content manager 140-1 can send the audio/images of subscriber 108-1 as captured by camera resource 175-1 over the web channel to management resource 110-6.  Management resource 110-6 forwards the audio/images of
the subscriber 108-1 as captured by camera resource 175-1 to the network application in content manager 140-2 that displays the images/audio as a picture-in-picture over the football game rendered in display screen 130-2.
<br/><br/> In a reverse direction, the network application in content manager 140-2 can send the audio/images of subscriber 108-2 as captured by camera resource 175-2 over a respective web channel to management resource 110-6.  Management resource 110-6
forwards the audio/images of the subscriber 108-2 as captured by the camera resource 175-2 to the network application in content manager 140-1 that displays the images/audio as a picture-in-picture over the football game rendered in display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, each subscriber can view the other subscriber and communicate with each other while watching the same football game.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 is an example diagram illustrating a computer architecture in which to execute one or more embodiments as discussed herein.
<br/><br/> Any of the different processing techniques can be implemented via execution of software code on a computer system.
<br/><br/> For example, as shown, computer system 151 (e.g., a computer device) of the present example can include an interconnect 511 that couples computer readable storage media 512 such as a non-transitory type of media (i.e., any type of hardware
storage medium) in which digital information can be stored and retrieved.  The computer system 151 can further include processor resource 513 (e.g., one or more processor devices), I/O interface 514, communications interface 517, etc.
<br/><br/> As its name suggests, I/O interface 514 provides connectivity to external resources or devices control devices 170, one or more display screens 130, etc.
<br/><br/> Computer readable storage medium 512 can be any hardware storage device to store data such as memory, optical storage, hard drive, floppy disk, etc. In one embodiment, the computer readable storage medium 512 stores instructions and/or data.
<br/><br/> Communications interface 517 enables the computer system 151 and one or more processor resource 513 to communicate over a resource such as network 190-3.  I/O interface 514 enables processor resource 513 to perform functions such as receive
control input from a respective subscriber, control a respective display screen, etc.
<br/><br/> As shown, computer readable storage media 512 can be encoded with content manager application 140-1-APP (e.g., software, firmware, etc.) executed by processor resource 513.  Content manager application 140-1-APP can be configured to include
instructions to implement any of the operations as discussed herein.
<br/><br/> During operation of one embodiment, processor resource 513 accesses computer readable storage media 512 via the use of interconnect 511 in order to launch, run, execute, interpret or otherwise perform the instructions in content manager
application 140-1-APP stored on computer readable storage medium 512.
<br/><br/> Execution of the content manager application 140-1-APP produces processing functionality such as content manager process 140-2-PROC in processor resource 513.  In other words, the content manager process 140-2-PROC associated with processor
resource 513 represents one or more aspects of executing content manager application 140-1-APP within or upon the processor resource 513 in the computer system 151.
<br/><br/> Those skilled in the art will understand that the computer system 151 can include other processes and/or software and hardware components, such as an operating system that controls allocation and use of hardware resources to execute content
manager 140-1-APP.
<br/><br/> In accordance with different embodiments, note that computer system may be any of various types of devices, including, but not limited to, a set-top box, a mobile computer, a personal computer system, a wireless device, base station, phone
device, desktop computer, laptop, notebook, netbook computer, mainframe computer system, handheld computer, workstation, network computer, application server, storage device, a consumer electronics device such as a camera, camcorder, set top box, mobile
device, video game console, handheld video game device, a peripheral device such as a switch, modem, router, etc., or in general any type of computing or electronic device.
<br/><br/> The computer system 151 may reside at any location or can be included in any suitable resource in network environment 100 to implement functionality as discussed herein.
<br/><br/> Functionality supported by the different resources will now be discussed via the flowchart in FIGS. 12-14.  Note that the steps in the flowcharts below can be executed in any suitable order.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 is a flowchart 1200 illustrating an example method facilitating interactive television according to embodiments.  Note that there will be some overlap with respect to concepts as discussed above.
<br/><br/> In processing block 1210, the content manager 140-1 receives a request to display a content guide 250 of available content.
<br/><br/> In processing block 1220, in response to receiving the request, the content manager 140-1 initiates display of the content guide 250-1 on a display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> In processing block 1230, in the displayed content guide 250-1, the content manager 140-1 initiates display of multiple selectable content viewing options.  A first selectable channel viewing option (such as channel 556) corresponds to a
television channel from which to view content 113-2 originating from a content sponsor 105-1.  A second channel viewing option corresponds to an auxiliary channel (e.g., 556 WEB) with respect to the television channel from which to access available
over-the-top content 114 associated with the content 113-2 originating from the content sponsor 105-1.  Content originated by the content sponsor 105-1 includes any content provided by or made available by the content sponsor 105-1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 is a flowchart 1300 illustrating an example method of interactive television according to embodiments.  Note that there will be some overlap with respect to concepts as discussed above.
<br/><br/> In processing block 1310, the content manager 140-1 renders content received over a cable network channel on display screen 130-1.  The cable network channel can be allocated to distribute content originating from a content sponsor assigned to
the cable network channel.
<br/><br/> In processing block 1320, the content manager 140-1 receives a request to access web content associated with the cable network channel.
<br/><br/> In response to receiving the request: In processing block 1340, the content manager 140-1 maps an identity of the cable network channel currently displayed on the display screen 130-1 to a network address of a server resource from which the web
content (i.e., supplemental content) associated with the cable network channel is retrievable.  In processing block 1350, the content manager 140-1 retrieves the web content from a server resource as specified by the network address.  In processing block
1360, the content manager 140-1 initiates display of the retrieved web content on the display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 is a flowchart 1400 illustrating an example method of interactive television according to embodiments.  Note that there will be some overlap with respect to concepts as discussed above.
<br/><br/> In processing block 1410, while rendering a television program on a display screen 130-1, the content manager 140-1 receives a command to view web content associated with the rendered television program.
<br/><br/> In processing block 1420, subsequent to and in response to receiving the command, the content manager 140-1 maps an identity of the television program being played back to a network address from which the web content associated with the
television program is retrievable.
<br/><br/> In processing block 1430, the content manager 140-1 retrieves the web content from a server resource as specified by the network address.
<br/><br/> In processing block 1440, the content manager 140-1 initiates display of the web content on the display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 15 is an example diagram illustrating a content guide according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> In this example embodiment, assume that the content manager 140-1 receives a request from subscriber 108-1 to display content guide 250-3 on display screen 130-1.  In response to receiving the request, the content manager 140-1 initiates display
of the content guide 250-3 on the display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> The content guide 250-3 includes a display of multiple selectable channel viewing options.  For example, the user 108-1 can move selection window 260 about regions of display screen 130-1 to select any of the available channels of content.
<br/><br/> By way of a non-limiting example, channel 950 represents a first selectable channel viewing option that corresponds to a cable network television channel (such as ESPN2.TM.) from which to retrieve content (e.g., a respective college basketball
game #1) originating from a first content sponsor such as ESPN.
<br/><br/> Channel 951 is a second selectable channel viewing option that corresponds to an auxiliary channel (e.g., an over-the-top channel) from which to access over-the-top content available from a second content sponsor such as Facebook.TM..
<br/><br/> Channel 952 is a third selectable channel viewing option that corresponds to an auxiliary channel (e.g., an over-the-top channel) from which to access over-the-top content available from a third content sponsor such as Netflix.TM..
<br/><br/> Via selection of any of the channels using selection window 260, the content manager 140-1 receives notification to tune to a respective channel.
<br/><br/> Note that in addition to moving the respective navigation window 260 to select and view content as specified by the corresponding channel, the subscriber 108-1 can press one or more buttons on the control device 170-1 to select the appropriate
sequence of numbers to select a channel.  For example, the subscriber 108-1 can press buttons `9`, `5`, and `0` to select the channel 950; the subscriber 108-1 can press buttons `9`, `5`, and `1` to select the channel 951; the subscriber 108-1 can press
buttons `9`, `5`, and `2` to select the channel 952; and so on.  Accordingly, navigation and selection of a respective channel can be achieved in a number of different ways.
<br/><br/> By way of further non-limiting example, the content guide 250-3 can initiate display of additional information in the different content viewing options.  For example, channel 950 can be a content viewing option including a notification
specifying a title assigned to respective playable content available in a scheduled time slot of the television channel 950; channel 951 can be a content viewing option including display of a notification specifying availability of the over-the-top
content such as personal account information associated with Facebook.TM.  via an auxiliary channel; channel 952 can be a content viewing option including display of a notification specifying availability of the over-the-top content such as a Netflix
content guide via an auxiliary channel; and so on.
<br/><br/> Thus, as shown, available over-the-top content can be assigned a numerical value in a numerical sequence.  The content manager 140-1 displays the content viewing options in accordance with the numerical channel sequence.  More specifically, each
numerical channel value (e.g., 950, 951, 952, .  . . ) in the numerical channel sequence can be configured to specify a corresponding channel from which to retrieve available content.  In the present example, the content manager 140-1 displays a first
numerical channel value such as channel 950 to indicate content available from content sponsor ESPN2.TM.  in content guide 250-3; the content manager 140-1 displays a second numerical channel value such as channel 951 to indicate content available from
content sponsor Facebook.TM.  in content guide 250-3; the content manager 140-1 displays a third numerical channel value such as channel 952 to indicate content available from content sponsor Netflix.TM.  in content guide 250-3; and so on.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, responsive to receiving selection of numerical channel value 951, the content manager 140-1 maps the numerical channel value 951 to a respective network address associated with Facebook.TM..  The network address indicates a
server resource from which to retrieve the over-the-top content for retrieval and viewing on display screen 130-1.  To display personal <b><i>Facebook</i></b> account information on display screen 130-1, the content manager 140-1 utilizes the network address to
communicate with the server resource over an auxiliary channel (e.g., an over-the-top channel supported by one or more of data channels 123).
<br/><br/> More specifically, the content manager 140-1 transmits a content request message over the auxiliary channel to retrieve the over-the-top content available from Facebook.TM..  The content manager 140-1 receives the requested over-the-top content
over the auxiliary channel from the server resource and renders the over-the-top content on the display screen 130-1.  One embodiment herein can include storing personal settings associated with a respective subscriber and, upon selection of the channel
951, the content manager 140-1 utilizes the personal settings to request the personal information from the Facebook.TM.  website for the subscriber.  Accordingly, accessing a subscriber account can be achieved by merely selecting the channel 951.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, embodiments herein can include: responsive to receiving selection of channel 951 in the content guide 250 (such as a cable network content guide), the content manager 140-1 initiates retrieval of personal social networking account
information from a Facebook.TM.  content sponsor website over an auxiliary channel.  The content manager 140-1 then initiates display of the personal social networking account information on the display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> In a similar manner, the subscriber 108-1 can select channel 952.  Responsive to receiving selection of the channel 952 (e.g., a selectable content viewing option) in the content guide 250-3, the content manager 140-1 initiates retrieval of
content such as an over-the-top content guide for viewing different over-the-top content available from 3.sup.rd party content provider Netflix.TM..  The content manager 140-1 initiates display of the over-the-top Netflix content guide on display screen
130-1.
<br/><br/> Via further input to the retrieved and displayed over-the-top Netflix.TM.  content guide, the subscriber can select a specific title of content amongst multiple titles of content displayed in the over-the-top Netflix.TM.  content guide.  For
example, the subscriber 108-1 can provide further input of which of multiple content selections the subscriber 108-1 would like to retrieve for viewing on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> As previously discussed, via selection of channel 950 in content guide 250-3 by subscriber 108-1, the content manager 140-1 tunes to the cable network television channel 950 such as a broadcast channel, IPTV channel, etc. In such an instance,
the content manager 140-1 decodes a video signal received on the cable network television channel 950 and then renders video derived from the video signal on the display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 is an example diagram illustrating of a method of providing notification of content from multiple types of sources according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> In processing block 1610, the content manager 140-1 receives a request to display a content guide 250 of available content.
<br/><br/> In processing block 1620, in response to receiving the request, the content manager 140-1 initiates display of the content guide 250-3 on the display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> In processing block 1610, in the displayed content guide 250-3, the content guide 250-3 initiates display of multiple selectable channel viewing options.  A first selectable channel viewing option corresponds to a cable network television
channel from which to access content originating from a first content sponsor.  A second selectable channel viewing option corresponds to an auxiliary channel from which to access over-the-top content available from a second content sponsor.
<br/><br/> Note again that techniques herein are well suited for use in a cable network environment.  However, it should be noted that embodiments herein are not limited to use in such applications and that the techniques discussed herein are well suited
for other applications as well.
<br/><br/>Additional Embodiments
<br/><br/> As previously discussed, conventional techniques of accessing content from different sources suffer from deficiencies.  For example, assume that a subscriber views a rendition of content received over a primary broadcast channel.  Certain
subscribers may be interested in viewing additional content associated with the content transmitted in the primary broadcast channel.  According to conventional techniques as discussed above, to view supplemental content, a subscriber would have to
operate a different device such as a computer at a different location to view the additional information associated with the corresponding content received in the primary broadcast channel.
<br/><br/> As a specific example, assume that the subscriber views a sporting event such as a golf tournament on the primary broadcast channel.  If the user would like to view additional details regarding the golf event (or other matter), the subscriber
typically would have to operate a remotely located computer device (with respect to a television playing back the broadcasted content) to research the matter of interest.  For example, the user would have to log onto a respective computer and operate a
web browser to obtain the extra information.  This is undesirable, as the subscriber typically must leave the room to operate the computer device.  In certain instances, the content sponsors may provide additional content associated with the content
broadcasted in the primary broadcast channel.  Such content may be available as over-the-top content.
<br/><br/> Embodiments herein include enabling a user such as a cable network subscriber to more easily retrieve and play back supplemental content associated with a content sponsor, television program, television channel, etc. In certain instances,
embodiments herein enable a user to have a more interactive experience with respect to viewing content available from multiple sources.
<br/><br/> More specifically, one embodiment herein includes a content distribution resource.  The content distribution resource initiates distribution of corresponding content over a primary broadcast channel of a communication link to a subscriber.  The
content distribution resource receives selection of over-the-top content from the subscriber.  In one embodiment, the over-the-top content is supplemental content associated with the corresponding content distributed over the primary broadcast channel. 
In response to receiving the selection, the content distribution resource transmits the over-the-top content in a secondary channel of the communication link to the subscriber.
<br/><br/> Another embodiment herein includes a content manager disposed in a location such as a subscriber domain in a cable network environment.  The content manager initiates play back of corresponding content on a display screen.  The content manager
receives the corresponding content over a primary broadcast channel selected amongst multiple available channels.  The content manager can receive selection of over-the-top content available over a secondary channel with respect to the primary broadcast
channel.  In one embodiment, the over-the-top content is supplemental content associated with the corresponding content received in the primary broadcast channel.  In response to receiving the selection, the content manager retrieves the over-the-top
content on the secondary channel, and initiates play back of the over-the-top content on the display screen for viewing by the subscriber.
<br/><br/> These and more detailed embodiments are discussed below.
<br/><br/> Any of the resources as discussed herein can include one or more computerized devices, servers, base stations, wireless communication equipment, communication management systems, workstations, handheld or laptop computers, or the like to carry
out and/or support any or all of the method operations disclosed herein.  In other words, one or more computerized devices or processors can be programmed and/or configured to operate as explained herein to carry out different embodiments of the
invention.
<br/><br/> Yet other embodiments herein include software programs to perform the steps and operations summarized above and disclosed in detail below.  One such embodiment comprises a computer program product including a non-transitory computer-readable
storage medium (i.e., any computer readable hardware storage medium) on which software instructions are encoded for subsequent execution.  The instructions, when executed in a computerized device having a processor, program and/or cause the processor to
perform the operations disclosed herein.  Such arrangements are typically provided as software, code, instructions, and/or other data (e.g., data structures) arranged or encoded on a non-transitory computer readable storage medium such as an optical
medium (e.g., CD-ROM), floppy disk, hard disk, memory stick, one or more memory chips, etc., or other non-transitory media such as firmware or short code in one or more ROM, RAM, PROM, etc., or as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), etc.
The software or firmware or other such configurations can be installed onto a computerized device to cause the computerized device to perform the techniques explained herein.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, embodiments herein are directed to a method, system, computer program product, etc., that supports operations as discussed herein.
<br/><br/> One embodiment includes computer readable storage hardware and/or system having instructions stored thereon.  The instructions, when executed by computer processor hardware (such as one or more computer devices), cause the computer processor
hardware to: on a display screen, initiate play back of corresponding content received on a primary broadcast channel selected amongst multiple available channels; receive selection of over-the-top content, the over-the-top content available over a
secondary channel with respect to the primary broadcast channel, the over-the-top content being supplemental content associated with the corresponding content received in the primary broadcast channel; and in response to receiving the selection: i)
retrieve the over-the-top content on the secondary channel, and ii) initiate play back of the over-the-top content on the display screen.
<br/><br/> Another embodiment includes computer readable storage hardware and/or system having instructions stored thereon.  The instructions, when executed by computer processor hardware (such as one or more computer devices), cause the computer processor
hardware to: initiate distribution of corresponding content over a primary broadcast channel of a communication link to a subscriber; receive selection of over-the-top content from the subscriber, the over-the-top content being supplemental content
associated with the corresponding content distributed over the primary broadcast channel; and in response to receiving the selection, transmit the over-the-top content in a secondary channel of the communication link to the subscriber.
<br/><br/> The ordering of the steps above has been added for clarity sake.  Note that any of the processing steps as discussed herein can be performed in any suitable order.
<br/><br/> Other embodiments of the present disclosure include software programs and/or respective hardware to perform any of the method embodiment steps and operations summarized above and disclosed in detail below.
<br/><br/> It is to be understood that the system, method, apparatus, instructions on computer readable storage media, etc., as discussed herein also can be embodied strictly as a software program, firmware, as a hybrid of software, hardware and/or
firmware, or as hardware alone such as within a processor, or within an operating system or a within a software application.
<br/><br/> As discussed herein, techniques herein are well suited for use in distributing main content as well as corresponding supplemental content in a cable network environments.  However, it should be noted that embodiments herein are not limited to
use in such applications and that the techniques discussed herein are well suited for other applications as well.
<br/><br/> Additionally, note that although each of the different features, techniques, configurations, etc., herein may be discussed in different places of this disclosure, it is intended, where suitable, that each of the concepts optionally can be
executed independently of each other or in combination with each other.  Accordingly, the one or more present inventions as described herein can be embodied and viewed in many different ways.
<br/><br/> Now, more particularly, FIG. 17 is an example diagram illustrating distribution of content according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> As shown and previously discussed, subscriber domain 150-1 can include a content manager 140-1 such as a set-top box or other suitable processing hardware and/or software.  Content manager 140-1 can tune to any of multiple broadcast channels or
video on demand channels to retrieve content.  Content manager 140-1 has the ability to tune to any such channels in accordance with user input.
<br/><br/> In this example embodiment, assume that the user 108-1 (such as a subscriber in a cable network environment) provides control input to content manager 140-1 to tune to channel 122 received over communication link 191.  Content distribution
resource 125-1 initiates distribution of corresponding content A over channel 122 (such as a primary broadcast channel) of communication link 191 to subscriber domain 150-1.  In one embodiment, content manager 140-1 in subscriber domain 150-1 receives
content A (or content 113-2) as content broadcasted in a particular timeslot.
<br/><br/> As discussed herein, in addition to receiving content A broadcasted over communication link 191, the user 108-1 can initiate retrieval of related content (such as over-the-top content associated with content in the primary broadcast channel)
over one or more auxiliary channels.  For example, assume in this example embodiment that the communication link 191 includes a data channel such as channel 123-1 allocated for retrieval of over-the-top content such as content A' from a respective such
as a server.
<br/><br/> Assume that the content manager 140-1 receives selection of over-the-top content A' from the user 108-1.  In this example embodiment, the over-the-top content A' is supplemental content associated with the corresponding content A distributed
over the primary broadcast channel 122.
<br/><br/> The user 108-1 selection of the content A' can include transmitting a request message from content manager 140-1 through content distribution resource 125-1 to a server resource that serves respective content A' over channel 123-1 to the content
manager 140-1.  The request message can be transmitted in accordance with any suitable over-the-top communication protocol.  In response to receiving the selection, the server resource 110-2 transmits content 114 (content A') to distribution resource
125-1; distribution resource 125-1 transmits the over-the-top content in channel 123-1 of the communication link 191 to the content manager 140-1.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, content manager 140-1 initiates storage of the received content A and content A' in storage resource 1780.  For example, content manager 140-1 can be configured to include storage resource 1780 (such as a digital video
recorder) to store the content received over channel 122 and channel 123-1 (or any other channels).  The storage resource 1780 can be located locally or remotely with respect to subscriber domain 150-1.  Subsequent to storage of the over-the-top content
A' and the corresponding content A in the storage resource 1780, the user 108-1 controls play back of the stored content on the display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> By further way of a non-limiting example, content A' can be auxiliary or supplemental content that is streamed in a linear or scheduled manner over channel 123-1 (such as secondary channel) as supplemental content with respect to content A
transmitted in channel 122 (such as a primary broadcast channel).  In such an embodiment, transmission of the content A' over channel 123-1 as synchronous content with respect to content A in primary broadcast channel 122 enables the viewer to view, on
play back, supplemental content with respect to the content A.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, as discussed above, content A' can be non-synchronous data that is not synchronized to portions of content A.
<br/><br/> Content A and content A' can be played back as the content is received over communication link 191.  If stored, the content can be played back from storage resource 1780.  Play back of the content (content A and/or content A') on display screen
130-1 from the storage resource 1780 enables the respective user 108-1 to perform functions such as fast forward, rewind, pause, etc., with respect to content.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the user 108-1 can provide input indicating which available content to store in storage resource 1780 over time.  As previously discussed, auxiliary or supplemental content may or may not be available for corresponding content
available in a primary broadcast channel.  If supplemental content (such as content A') is available for respective content, the content manager 140-1 can provide notification that supplemental content is available for recording along with the content A.
Upon receiving an input command to record particular content A on a primary broadcast channel, as well a command to record content A', the content the content manager 140-1 records and stores the respective content in storage resource 1780.  Accordingly,
a respective user 108-1 can decide whether to store supplemental content A' when programming the content manager 140-1 to record content A.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the user 108-1 can provide input to content manager 140-1 to display recorded information content guide 1720.  As its name suggests, the recorded information content guide 1720 indicates what content has been stored in the
storage resource 1780.  In one embodiment, in response to receiving input from the user 108-1 to display a listing of content stored in storage resource 1780, the content manager 140-1 initiates display of a respective notification (such as recorded
information content guide 1720).
<br/><br/> In this example, the recorded information content guide 1720 indicates that both the over-the-top content A' (received over channel 123-1) and the corresponding content A (received in the primary broadcast channel such as channel 122) have been
stored in the storage resource 1780.  For example, the recorded information content guide 1720 indicates that content A was received over primary broadcast channel 556 and that content A' is available and was received over a secondary channel 556WEB
(such as an over-the-top content channel).  In this example embodiment, the recorded information content guide 1720 also indicates that content B is stored in storage resource 1780 and was received over primary broadcast channel 558 and is available for
retrieval and play back.
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 is an example diagram illustrating synchronization of content on multiple channels according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> As previously discussed, and further described herein below, the corresponding content A' (received on the over-the-top channel 123-1) can be substantially synchronized with respect to the content A (received over the primary broadcast channel). Corresponding synchronization information can indicate a correlation of portions of content A to corresponding portions of content A'. In one embodiment, the synchronization information can be used to switch between play back of the corresponding content
A and the over-the-top content A' on the display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> More specifically, as shown, the content A transmitted over the primary broadcast channel (such as channel 556 or a linear channel in which respective content is simultaneously transmitted to multiple subscribers) can include segments of content
including segment A-102, A-103, .  . . , A-114, etc. Assume that the data stream including segments of content A are transmitted in a respective time slot such as between 5:00 and 5:30 pm.
<br/><br/> As shown, the content A' transmitted over the secondary channel (such as channel 556 WEB) can include segments of content including segment A'-548, A'-549, .  . . , A'-560, etc., available in the time slot between 5:00 and 5:30 pm.  The data
stream including segments of content A' can be available and transmitted in a respective time slot such as between 5:00 and 5:30 pm as well.  Accordingly, the over-the-top content (i.e., content A') received on the over-the-top channel (channel 556 WEB)
is linear scheduled content in which the over-the-top content is scheduled for distribution in a same respective time slot as content A.
<br/><br/> As mentioned, the segments of content in each data stream (content A and content A') can be synchronized or related to each other.  For example, content A and content A' can include video footage associated with a same sporting event such a
football game.  Segment A-106 in content A can represent an image of a play taken from one camera angle, corresponding segment A'-552 can represent an image of the same play taken from another angle at the same football event.  As mentioned, the channel
123-1 enables retrieval of the supplemental content (content A').  In this manner, the segments of content in each data stream can be related to each other, affording the respective user 108-1 an opportunity to switch between viewing different channel
information for the same event.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, during real-time or substantially real-time receipt of content A and content A', the availability of portions (segments) of the over-the-top content A' for play back by the subscriber varies depending on which particular
portion of the corresponding content A is being broadcasted to the subscriber over the primary broadcast channel.  For example, a respective server resource 110-2 that serves segment A'-552 makes this portion (segment A'552) of content available at
approximately or substantially the same time that content distribution resource 125-1 broadcasts segment A-106 over the channel 122; server resource 110-2 that serves segment A'-555 makes this portion (segment A'555) of content available at approximately
or substantially the same time that content distribution resource 125-1 broadcasts segment A-109 over the channel 122; server resource that serves segment A'-560 makes this portion (segment A'560) of content available at approximately or substantially
the same time that content distribution resource 125-1 broadcasts segment A-114 over the channel 122; and so on.  Each of the segments in content A can be mapped to a corresponding segment in content A'.
<br/><br/> As previously discussed, in one embodiment, the server resource 1780 stores both streams of content A and content A' in storage resource 1780.  Note that stored content can include metadata or synchronization information such as map 1850.  Map
1850 can be generated from any suitable resource such as server resource 110-2.  Map 1850 can be transmitted in any suitable manner such as over content 123-1.
<br/><br/> Map 1850 can include appropriate pointers indicating a correlation between segments in each data stream.  For example, via respective pointer information, map 1850 indicates that a location such as segment A'-548 in content A corresponds to
segment A-102 in content A'; via respective pointer information, map 1850 indicates that a location such as segment A'-549 in content A' corresponds to segment A-103 in content A; and so on.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, map 1850 can be used to identify a relationship between data in one channel and another.
<br/><br/> FIG. 19 is an example diagram illustrating play back of content received over multiple channels according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> As shown, assume in this example that the content manager 140-1 initiates play back of segments of content A on display screen 130-1.  In such an instance, the content manager 140-1 displays a rendition of segments A-102, A-103, A-104, A-105 on
display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> During play back, assume that the content manager 140-1 receives a command from the user 108-1 to switchover to play back of content A' on the display screen 130-1 at around a time T1 of playing back a rendition of segment A-105 on display
screen 130-1.  In such an instance, to play back content A', the content manager 140-1 uses map 1850 to identify a corresponding location in content A' to play back on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> As mentioned, if the content A' is stored in storage resource 1780, then the content manager 140-1 obtains the segment A'-552 and subsequent segments such as segments A'-553, A'-554) from storage resource 1780 for play back on display screen
130-1.  If the content A is received in substantially real-time over primary broadcast channel 556 (instead of being stored), and the content manager 140-1 receives a respective command to switchover to play back of the content A', the content manager
140-1 can use a respective pointer value as specified by map 1850 to identify which portion of a respective data stream of content A' to retrieve from the server resource 110-2 over channel 123-1 to play back on display screen 130-1.  As an alternative,
the server resource 110-2 can be configured to transmit the appropriate segment of content A' depending on a time of receiving the request.
<br/><br/> In one example embodiment, by way of a non-limiting example, retrieval of the over-the-top content A' can include, from the content manager 140-1: obtaining timing information (such as a pointer value) indicating a current play back location in
the corresponding content A played back on the display screen 130-1; forwarding the timing information to a server resource distributing the over-the-top content A'. The server resource can be configured to use map 1850 to correlate the timing
information to a corresponding location in the content A' data stream.  From the server resource over channel 123-1, the content manager 140-1 controlled by user 108-1 receives the over-the-top content at the corresponding location in the data stream;
and initiates display of the over-the-top content (such as segments A'-552, A'-553, A'-554) at the corresponding location on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> During further play back of segments A'-552, A'-553, A'-554 on display screen 130-1, assume that the content manager 140-1 receives a command from the user 108-1 at approximately time T2 to switchover to play back of content A again on the
display screen 130-1 at around a time of playing back a rendition of segment A'-554 on display screen 130-1.  In such an instance, to play back content A, the content manager 140-1 uses map 1850 to identify a corresponding location in content A to play
back on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> As mentioned, if the content A is stored in storage resource 1780, then the content manager 140-1 obtains the segment A'-109 and subsequent segments such as segments A-109, A-110, etc.) from storage resource 1780 for play back on display screen
130-1.  If the content A' is received in substantially real-time (instead of being stored in storage resource 1780), and the content manager 140-1 receives a respective command to switchover to play back of the content A again, the content manager 140-1
can use a respective pointer value or timing information as specified by map 1850 to identify which portion of a respective data stream of content A to retrieve from the server resource 110-2 over channel 123-1 to play back on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> Play back of content from can include display of content A using all picture elements available in display screen 130-1.  Upon playing back content A', all of the picture elements of the display screen 130-1 can be allocated to display a
rendition of content A'.
<br/><br/> As an example embodiment, note that play back of the supplemental content A' can include display of the content A' as a picture in picture.  For example, the content manager 140-1 can be configured to continue playing back the corresponding
content A (such as segments A-106, A-107, A-108) as background video image on the display screen 130-1 while the content manager 140-1 initiates display of the over-the-top content A' (such as segments A'-552, A'553, A'554) as an overlay with respect to
the background video image.
<br/><br/> Note that one or more segments of content can be encoded to include a displayable notification indicating availability of the over-the-top content for retrieval.  For example, in accordance with one embodiment, the user 108-1 can operate content
manager 140-1 to play back content A received on channel 556 as mentioned.  Note that segment A-105 (or other segment in content A) can include notification information that when played back on the display screen 130-1, indicates that corresponding
content (such as a different camera angle) is currently available for retrieval by the user 108-1 on channel A'.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, embodiments herein include initiating display of a notification on the display screen 130-1 during play back of a rendition of the corresponding content A on the display screen 130-1.  The notification on display screen 130-1
indicates availability of the corresponding over-the-top content A'. In response to receiving input from a respective user 108-1 to switchover to the alternative channel and play back of the over-the-top content A', the content manager 140-1 plays back
the content A' available over channel 123-1.
<br/><br/> In a similar manner, note that one or more segments of content A' can include notification information indicating corresponding segments of content A that are currently available in channel 122 for play back on the display screen 130-1. 
Accordingly, as shown, the user 108-1 can initiate switching between play back of content A and content A' on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 20 is an example diagram-illustrating play back of content received over multiple channels according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> As an alternative to playing back content as described in FIG. 19, embodiments herein can include playing back content as shown in FIG. 20.  For example, initially, the content manager 140-1 initiates display of segments A-102, A-103, A-104 and
A-105 on display screen 130-1.  In response to receiving the selection of content A' at time T3, the content manager 140-1 discontinues play back of the corresponding content A on the display screen 130-1.  The content manager 140-1 can be configured to
store a pointer value (or timing information) specifying a location in the corresponding content where play back of the corresponding content was discontinued.  In this example, the content manager 140-1 discontinues play back of content A at a time
between segments A-105 and A-106 in channel A.
<br/><br/> The location at segment A'-552 in the data stream at content A' corresponds to the current location (between segment A-105 and A-106) in content A. In response to receiving the command to play back content A' at or around time T3, the content
manager 140-1 retrieves segments of content A' (such as segments A'-552, A'-553, etc.) from a respective server resource or from storage resource 1780 in a manner as previously discussed.
<br/><br/> Recall that content A' can be scheduled content transmitted in a respective time slot.  As shown, in accordance with map 1820, the available segment in data stream content A' at or around time T3 is segment A'-552.  Accordingly, content manager
140-1 retrieves and plays back a rendition of segment A'-552 on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> While the content manager 140-1 plays back segments A'-552, A'-553, etc., if desired, the content manager 140-1 can store segments A-106, A-107, A-108, etc.
<br/><br/> Subsequent to time T3, assume that the content manager 140-1 receives a command at or around time T4 to resume play back of the corresponding content A on the display screen 130-1 again.  In such an instance, the content manager 140-1 in this
example embodiment initiates play back of the corresponding content A at the location specified by the previously stored pointer value.  For example, content manager 140-1 retrieves the stored pointer value or timing information and initiates play back
of segments A-106, A-107, A-108, etc., on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> In this manner, inserting play back of segments such as segments A'-552, A'-553, etc., between segments A-105 and segment A-106 enables the user 108-1 to view an entirety of content A, even though the user 108-1 happens to switchover to play
back of content A' for some amount of time.
<br/><br/> As previously discussed, the content manager 140-1 can be configured to initiate display of a notification on the display screen 130-1 during play back of a rendition of the corresponding content A on the display screen 130-1.  In such an
instance, the notification can indicate availability of the over-the-top content A' over channel 123-1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 21 is an example diagram illustrating play back of content received over multiple channels according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> As previously discussed, availability of the different portions of the over-the-top content A' for play back on the display screen 130-1 from the secondary channel (such as channel 556 WEB) varies depending on which particular portion of the
corresponding content A is being played back by the subscriber or which particular portion of the content is broadcasted to subscribers over channel 556 in a cable network environment.
<br/><br/> In this example embodiment, instead of being linear content transmitted in channel 556 WEB, the content A' available over channel 556 WEB can be video or non-video available for viewing along with or in lieu of content A. For example,
supplemental content X is available for viewing at or around segment A-105; supplemental content Y is available for viewing at or around time A-113; and so on.
<br/><br/> Note that supplemental content X can be associated with segment A-105 or a range of segments such as segments A-102 through A-107; supplemental content Y can be associated with segment A-111 or a range of segments such as segments A-109 through
A-115; and so on.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the over-the-top content A' received on the secondary channel is non-video content such as static images (such as a text-based article).  Accordingly, the user can select supplemental content X (such as a text-based article)
while viewing or playing back content A on channel 556.  Further examples are presented below.
<br/><br/> FIG. 22 is an example diagram illustrating play back of content received over multiple channels according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> Assume that the content manager 140-1 receives a command to play back content A on display screen 130-1.  As previously discussed, the content A can be obtained from channel 556 or from storage.  In accordance with the command, assume that the
content manager 140-1 initiates play back of segments A-102, A-103, etc., on display screen 130-1.  At or around time T5, assume that the user 108-1 provides input to play back supplemental content X available over channel 556 WEB.
<br/><br/> Assume in this example that supplemental content X is video content.  In such an instance, and in response to receiving the command, the content manager 140-1 initiates play back of the over-the-top supplemental content X at a beginning location
of the supplemental content X regardless of a current location of playing back the corresponding content A on the display screen.  For example, at or around time T5, the content manager 140-1 stores a pointer value or timing information indicating when
the switchover from content A to content A' occurs (around time T5).  In one embodiment, to obtain supplemental content X, the content manager 140-1 receives notification of a current play back location (at or around time T5) with respect to the
corresponding content A received over the primary broadcast channel.  The content manager 140-1 (or other suitable resource such as content distribution resource 125-1) maps the current play back location to an appropriate portion of content A'
(supplemental content X).  The content distribution resource 125-1 initiates distribution of the portion of over-the-top content over the channel 123-1 to the content manager 140-1 that, in turn, initiates display of a rendition of supplemental content
X.
<br/><br/> The supplemental content X can be video of a defined play back length.  Eventually, the entirety of supplemental content X can be played back on the display screen 130-1 or the user 108-1 can input a respective command indicating to switch back
to play back of the original content A on display screen 130-1.  In such an instance, at or around time T6, the content manager 140-1 continues to play back the content A at a segment as specified by the previously stored pointer value or timing
information indicating when the user switched over from playing content A to content A'.
<br/><br/> In this example embodiment, content manager 140-1 initiates play back of segment A-106, A-107, A-108, etc., on display screen 130-1.  Accordingly, play back of the original content A is put on pause while the content manager 140-1 plays back
supplemental content X for viewing on the display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 23 is an example diagram illustrating play back of content received over multiple channels according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> As an alternative to pausing play back of content A during play back of respective content A on display screen 130-1, embodiments herein can include resuming play back of the content A again as if the content A continued to play in the
background.  For example, at or around time T7, assume that the content manager 140-1 initiates play back of supplemental content X on display screen 130-1.  Upon completion of playing back supplemental content X or receiving a switchover command at or
around time T8, the content manager 140-1 initiates play back of segment A-109, A-110, etc., on display screen 130-1.  Thus, segments A-106, A-107, and A-108 can be skipped in favor of playing back a sequence of segments associated with supplemental
content X.
<br/><br/> FIG. 24 is an example diagram illustrating multiple auxiliary channels on which to receive related content according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> As previously discussed, content guide 250-1 in FIG. 2 can include identification of a respective supplemental channel (e.g., channel 556 WEB) on which to retrieve content associated with a primary broadcast channel (such as channel 556).
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 24, the content guide 250-2 can be configured to include multiple supplemental channels on which to retrieve information associated with a respective content sponsor.  For example, channel 556 can include corresponding auxiliary
channel 556 WEB1, channel 556 WEB2, and so on.
<br/><br/> Supplemental content may be available over a respective auxiliary channel at different times.  For example, supplemental content associated with channel 556 is not available over channel 556 WEB1 between 7:00 and 7:30 pm.  Supplemental content
associated with channel 556 is available over channel 556 WEB1 between 7:30 and 8:30 pm.
<br/><br/> In one non-limiting example embodiment, content available in channel 556 WEB1 includes a pre-programmed data steam available for play back on the display screen 130-1.  In response to selection of the secondary channel (channel 556 WEB1), the
content manager 140-1 initiates display of the pre-programmed data stream on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the content sponsor automatically generates the pre-programmed content.  For example, the supplemental content available over channel 556 WEB1 can be automatically generated by the content sponsor upon selection of the channel
556 WEB1.  In one non-limiting example embodiment, the content sponsor automatically curates the content transmitted over channel 556 WEB1 to include the top five news stories of the day.  In such an instance, via selection of channel 556 WEB1, the user
108-1 can bypass play back of a rendition of the content A available in channel 556 and view the top five stores available as over-the-top content A' over channel 123-1.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the user 108-1 can configure what type of content will be played back on the pre-programmed over-the-top content channel.  For example, the user 108-1 may be interested in playing back only recent stock market news associated
with the sponsor channel 556.  In this instance, the user 108-1 can pre-program the supplemental channel 556 WEB1 to play back the top five stock market stories when the respective user 108-1 selects the respective channel 556 WEB1 in the content guide
250-2.  In such an instance, upon selection of the channel 556 WEB1 by the subscriber in subscriber domain 150-1, the content manager 140-1 communicates with a respective server resource that serves top five stock market stories at the time of the
request.
<br/><br/> In a similar manner, a second subscriber such as a subscriber at a different subscriber domain 150-2 may be interested in only playing back sports news associated with the sponsor channel 556.  In this instance, the user can pre-program the
supplemental channel 556 WEB1 to play back the top five sports stories when the respective subscriber selects the respective channel 556 WEB1 in the content guide 250-2 at subscriber domain 150-2.  Upon selection of the channel 556 WEB1 by the subscriber
in subscriber domain 150-2, the respective content manager in subscriber domain 150-2 communicates with a respective server resource that serves top five sports stories at the time of the request.
<br/><br/> In this manner, each of multiple subscribers can configure respective supplemental content received over channel 556 WEB1 to perform different functions.
<br/><br/> Further in this example, the content guide 250-2 can include a second supplemental channel (channel 556 WEB2).  In one embodiment, channel 556 WEB2 provides the user 108-1 access to a content navigation guide from which a user viewing the
display screen 130-1 manually selects from the content navigation guide to retrieve selected content over the secondary channel.  For example, in response to selection of the channel 556 WEB2, the content manager 140-1 can be configured to communicate
with an appropriate web site and initiates display of the content viewing options 720 displayed in FIG. 7.  The user 108-1 is then able to navigate amongst multiple possible viewing options for play back of respective content on display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 25 is an example diagram illustrating a method of managing play back of content on multiple channels according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> In processing block 2510 of flowchart 2500, the content manager 140-1 initiates play back of corresponding content A on display screen 130-1.  The corresponding content A is received on a primary broadcast channel selected amongst multiple
available channels.
<br/><br/> In processing block 2520, the content manager 140-1 receives selection of over-the-top content A' available over a secondary channel with respect to the primary broadcast channel.  The over-the-top content is supplemental content associated with
the corresponding content transmitted in the primary broadcast channel.
<br/><br/> In processing block 2530, in response to receiving the selection, the content manager 140-1: i) retrieves the over-the-top content A', and ii) initiates play back of the over-the-top content A' on the display screen 130-1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 26 is an example diagram illustrating a method of distributing content according to embodiments herein.
<br/><br/> In processing block 2610 of flowchart 2600, the content distribution resource 125-1 initiates distribution of corresponding content A over a primary broadcast channel of a communication link 191 to a subscriber (such as user 108-1 in subscriber
domain 150-1).
<br/><br/> In processing block 2620, the content distribution resource 125-1 receives selection of over-the-top content A' from a user 108-1 (subscriber).  The over-the-top content is supplemental content associated with the corresponding content A
distributed over the primary broadcast channel.
<br/><br/> In processing block 2630, in response to receiving the selection, the content distribution resource 125-1 transmits the over-the-top content A' in a secondary channel of the communication link 191 to the subscriber.
