       <p> Methods and apparatus to share file(s)/recommendation(s) are disclosed.
     An example method includes verifying a first service used by a first user
     recommending a file and encoding a first service identification code with
     the file based on the first service, verifying a second service used by a
     second user upon receipt of a file request by the second user and/or
     detection of a mention of the second user in the file recommendation,
     searching for a second service identification code associated with the
     file based on the second service and encoding the second service
     identification code with the file, and providing the file recommendation
     with the first service identification code to the second user where the
     second service and the first service are the same or providing the file
     recommendation with the second service identification code to the second
     user where the second service and the first service are different.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> I. Overview
<br/><br/> Certain embodiments disclosed herein enable media sharing in a social context.  Certain embodiments disclosed herein enable improved integration of users who may subscribe to different online media services.  Certain embodiments disclosed herein
provide music sharing in a social network.  Certain embodiments disclosed herein make use of networked audio systems in two or more households to allow media sharing amongst those two or more households via the networked audio systems.  Certain
embodiments described herein provide cross-service linking amongst media providers.  Certain embodiments described herein provide route-to-best media searching.  Additional embodiments are described herein.
<br/><br/> For example, in an embodiment such as described more below, media such as, for example, music can be shared amongst users who might not otherwise have access to the same file on a shared storage medium and/or do not have access to the same
online music service (Rhapsody.TM., MOG, Napster.TM., and Spotify.TM.  are all current examples of an online music service).  Online music services may be free or based on a paid subscription.  Most often, if not every time, an online music services
requires a user to register with the service.
<br/><br/> Assume for this example that a music playlist of a first user is made available to or shared with a second user.  The music playlist may contain a list of track titles and the artist and/or album associated with the track title.  The music
playlist may contain one or more track titles.  Additionally, in this example, the first and second users do not have access to the same file on a shared storage medium and do not have access to the same online music service.
<br/><br/> The music playlist may be made available to, or shared with, the second user in a number of ways, such as by making the playlist available on a social site like <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or via a social service system made available by a consumer electronics
company to improve the social experience of music through its many households of networked audio systems (e.g., Sonos manufactures and sells networked audio systems and such a system may offer a social portal for connecting households though the sharing
of media), sending it via email, text, instant messaging and/or Twitter, posting the playlist in a digital magazine or website where the second user can access it and/or providing the playlist to the second user through some other known or future
developed method or system.
<br/><br/> To play one or more songs selected from the playlist by the second user, the system or some aspect thereof, such as described more below, may search for the music file that best pertains to (or matches) the selected track title in the second
user's local library of music and/or initiate a search at an online music service subscribed to by the second user, if any and which can be a different online music service from the first user.
<br/><br/> Subsequent to a successful search, the second user's system may retrieve and play the music at that time or add the music (e.g., with a proper pointer to a source of the second user) to a queue or holding place to be played at a later time.  If
the system cannot successfully locate the music, then it may indicate that result to the second user and/or provide an option on how to obtain the music (e.g., providing a URL link to purchase the music).  Note that in some embodiments, a software
application written for the online music service (the program may be referred to as a "media player"), subscribed to by the second user, may be the program that enables playback of the music via computer speakers or an audio system in communication with
the program.  The media player may be automatically launched upon determining that the second user is a subscriber to the music service or at some time later to enable music playback.
<br/><br/> Depending on the search and the system configuration, the actual track played by the second user may be from the same or different album as the track title from the playlist.  In one example, the recommended song and the song retrieved by the
second user might both be digital copies from the same album.  In another example, the recommended song might be a digital copy from the original album, whereas the song retrieved by the second user may be a digital copy from a greatest hits album.
<br/><br/> Additionally, depending on the search and the system configuration, the actual track played may be determined based in part on the quality of the music file.  That is, in some embodiments, the higher quality music file may be played, if two or
more music files pertaining to the selected track are found.  In an alternative embodiment, the lower quality music file is played, if two or music files are found, so that less bandwidth may be consumed.
<br/><br/> Moving on from the above illustration, an example embodiment of a method of sharing or matching music includes reading a music reference from a first user for a second user.  The first user using a first music access service to access music. 
The example method also includes identifying a music file associated with the music reference and identifying a second music access service different than the first music access service used by second user to access the music.  In addition, the example
method includes using the second music access service to at least one of play, point to, or queue the music file.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a "reference" from a user may be an active reference or recommendation (e.g., the user offers a particular recommendation).  In some embodiments, a "reference" may be based on some other defined criteria (e.g., the user's
listening or watching habits).  In some embodiments, a "reference" is a comment, an opinion, or a suggestion.  In other examples, the "reference" may be a gift such as, for example, where a first user purchases a music track for a second user.
<br/><br/> Some example methods also include receiving a music request from the second user in response to the music reference prior to using the second music access service to at least one of play, point to, or queue the music file.
<br/><br/> In some example methods, using the second music access service to at least one of play, point to, or queue the music file comprises searching online and/or in a local storage for the music file.
<br/><br/> Also, some example methods include using a third music access service used by the second user to access music in place of the second music access service to at least one of play, point to, or queue the music file where the third music access
service provides at least one of less expensive access to the music than the second music access service or higher quality music files than the second music access service.
<br/><br/> An example apparatus implemented in accordance with the present disclosure includes an interface to receive a file recommendation by a first user recommending a file and a verifier to detect a first service used by the first user and to detect a
second service used by a second user.  The example system also includes an encoder to associate a first service identification code with the file recommendation based on the first service used by the first user.  In addition, the example system includes
a searcher to search one or more of a local library or a network-accessible database for a second service identification code associated with the file based on the second service.  In the system the encoder is to associate the second service
identification code with the file, as well.  In addition, the example includes a playback engine to provide the file recommendation with the first service identification code to the second user where the second service and the first service are the same
service or to provide the file recommendation with the second service identification code to the second user where the second service and the first service are different services.  The example system further includes a database to store a record
associating one or more of the first service identification code or the second service identification code with the file recommendation.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a "recommendation" from a user may be an active reference or recommendation (e.g., the user offers a particular recommendation).  In some embodiments, a "recommendation" may be based on some other defined criteria (e.g., the
user's listening or watching habits).  In some embodiments a "recommendation" is synonymous with a "reference" described above.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the first user specifies the second user in the file recommendation and the searcher automatically searches for the second service identification code associated with the file.  In some examples, the service identification
codes include information related to one or more of the specific service or the specific file.  For example, a service identification code for Michael Jackson's song "Beat It" on Spotify may include information related to one or more of the Spotify
service itself, the song title "Beat It", the artist Michael Jackson, the album "Thriller" and/or any of the genres pop, R&amp;B, rock and/or funk.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the file is a music file.  Also, in some embodiments, the music file is one or more of a track, an artist, an album, a playlist, a station or a genre.  In other embodiments, the file is a video and audio file (e.g., a movie
or television show).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the encoder is to associate metadata with the file recommendation and the searcher is to locate the file based on the metadata when the second user does not use a second service.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the database is to store a list of connections for the first user to form a social network.  Also, in some embodiments, the example system includes an updater to dynamically inform the first user of additional file
recommendations recommended by the connections.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the playback engine automatically adds the file with the second service identification to a playlist at a playback device of the second user.  In addition, in some embodiments, the playlist is currently playing.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, one of the first service or the second service is one or more of a music service, radio service, an online radio service or an online streaming music service.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the interface is to receive an indication of the enjoyment level of the second user with respect to the file and the searcher to search for additional file recommendations based on the enjoyment level.
<br/><br/> Another example method implemented in accordance with the present disclosure includes verifying a first service used by a first user upon receipt of a file recommendation by a first user recommending a file and encoding a first service
identification code with the file based on the first service.  The example method also includes verifying a second service used by a second user upon one or more of receipt of a file request by the second user or detection of a mention of the second user
in the file recommendation.  In addition, the example method includes searching one or more of a local library or a network-accessible database for a second service identification code associated with the file based on the second service.  Furthermore,
the example method includes encoding the second service identification with the file.  The example method also includes providing the file recommendation with the first service identification code to the second user where the second service and the first
service are the same service or providing the file recommendation with the second service identification code to the second user where the second service and the first service are different services.  In addition, the example method includes storing a
record associating one or more of the first service identification code or the second service identification code with the file.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the example method includes encoding metadata with the file recommendation and locating the file based on the metadata when the second user does not use a second service.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the method includes storing a list of connections for the first user to form a social network.  Also, in some embodiments, the method includes dynamically informing the first user of additional file recommendations
recommended by the connections
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the method includes automatically adding the file with the second service identification to a playlist at a playback device of the second user.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the method further includes receiving an indication of the enjoyment level of the second user with respect to the file and searching for additional file recommendations based on the enjoyment level.
<br/><br/> An example tangible machine-readable medium has instructions stored thereon implemented in accordance with the present disclosure that when executed, cause a machine to at least verify a first service used by a first user upon receipt of a file
recommendation by a first user recommending a file and encode a first service identification code with the file based on the first service.  The instructions, when executed, further cause the machine to verify a second service used by a second user upon
one or more of receipt of a file request by the second user or detection of a mention of the second user in the file recommendation and search one or more of a local library or a network-accessible database for a second service identification code
associated with the file based on the second service.  The example instructions also cause the machine to encode the second service identification with the file.  In addition, the example instructions cause the machine to provide the file recommendation
with the first service identification code to the second user where the second service and the first service are the same service or providing the file recommendation with the second service identification code to the second user where the second service
and the first service are different services.  The example instructions further cause the machine to store a record associating one or more of the first service identification code or the second service identification code with the file.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the example instructions cause the machine to encode metadata with the file recommendation and locate the file based on the metadata when the second user does not use a second service.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the example instructions cause the machine to store a list of connections for the first user to form a social network.  Also, in some embodiments, the example instructions cause the machine to dynamically inform the first
user of additional file recommendations recommended by the connections
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the example instructions cause the machine to automatically add the file with the second service identification to a playlist at a playback device of the second user.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the example instructions cause the machine to receive an indication of the enjoyment level of the second user with respect to the file and search for additional file recommendations based on the enjoyment level.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a user can choose to "recommend" an artist and/or album and/or track.  By choosing to recommend the media, an internal, service-specific identifier is encoded with the recommendation in a database for a set of users, such as
friends.  For example, if a user recommends a track using the online music service, Rhapsody, the system would encode a Rhapsody ID in the recommendation, so that when other users (e.g., his or her friends) see what is recommended the system will play if
the other users happen to also have a Rhapsody account.  In addition, the address book (e.g., a list of friends) could be stored on a centralized server and accessible through an audio system controller, such as described in FIG. 3 below, for example.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the system could also allow for tracks on one music service to be played on another, by utilizing a search function.  When the system gets an ID for a shared track, and discovers that the user does not have a subscription to
that service, the system could then request the metadata (album/artist/title) for the track and run a search on whatever music service (and local library) is presently available.  The actual list of artists/albums/tracks that the friends have recommended
is treated by the system as a library item, so that the recommendations can be dynamically updated.

understood by one skilled in the art, may be combined with other embodiments.
<br/><br/> II.  Example Environment
<br/><br/> Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals may refer to like parts throughout the figures.  FIG. 1 shows an example system configuration 100 in which one or more of the method and/or apparatus disclosed herein may be practiced or
implemented.  By way of illustration, the system configuration 100 represents a home with multiple zones.  Each zone, for example, represents a different room or space, such as an office, bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, dining room, family room, home theater
room, utility or laundry room, and patio.  While not shown here, a single zone may cover more than one room or space.  One or more of zone players 102-124 are shown in each respective zone.  A zone player 102-124, also referred to as a playback device,
multimedia unit, speaker, etc., provides audio, video, and/or audiovisual output.  A controller 130 (e.g., shown in the kitchen for purposes of illustration) provides control to the system configuration 100.  The system configuration 100 illustrates an
example whole house audio system, though it is understood that the technology described herein is not limited to its particular place of application or to an expansive system like a whole house audio system 100 of FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C show example illustrations of zone players 200-204.  The zone players 200-204 of FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C, respectively, may correspond to any of the zone players 102-124 of FIG. 1.  While certain embodiments provide multiple
zone players, an audio output may be generated using only a single zone player.  FIG. 2A illustrates a zone player 200 including sound producing equipment 208 capable of generating sound or an audio output corresponding to a signal received (e.g.,
wirelessly and/or via a wired interface).  The sound producing equipment 208 of the zone player 200 of FIG. 2A includes a built-in amplifier (not shown in this illustration) and speakers (e.g., a tweeter, a mid-range driver, and/or a subwoofer.  In
certain embodiments, the zone player 200 of FIG. 2A may be configured to play stereophonic audio or monaural audio.  As described in greater detail below, in some embodiments, the example zone player 200 of FIG. 2A can also transmit a second signal to,
for example, other zone player(s) in the same or different zone(s), speaker(s), receiver(s), etc. Transmission of the second signal may be part of, for example, a system in which multiple zone players, speakers, receivers, etc. form a network to, for
example, present media content in a synchronization or distributed manner.
<br/><br/> The example zone player 202 of FIG. 2B includes a built-in amplifier (not shown in this illustration) to power a set of detached speakers 210.  The speakers 210 of FIG. 2B may include, for example, any type of loudspeaker.  The zone player 202
of FIG. 2B can communicate a signal corresponding to audio content to the detached speakers 210 via wired and/or wireless channels.  Instead of receiving and generating audio content as in FIG. 2A, the zone player 202 of FIG. 2B receives the audio
content and transmits the same (e.g., after processing the received signal) to the detached speakers 210.  Similar to the example zone player 200 of FIG. 2A, in some embodiments the zone player 202 can transmit a second signal to, for example, other zone
player(s) in the same or different zone(s), speaker(s), receiver(s), etc.
<br/><br/> The example zone player 204 of FIG. 2C does not include an amplifier, but allows a receiver 214, or another audio and/or video type device with built-in amplification, to connect to a data network 128 of FIG. 1 and to play audio received over
the data network 128 via the receiver 214 and a set of detached speakers 216.  In addition to the wired couplings shown in FIG. 2C, the detached speakers 216 can receive audio content via a wireless communication channel between the detached speakers 216
and, for example, the zone player 204 and/or the receiver 214.  In some embodiments the zone player 202 can transmit a second signal to, for example, other zone player(s) in the same or different zone(s), speaker(s), receiver(s), etc.
<br/><br/> Example zone players include a "Sonos.RTM.  S5," "Sonos Play:5," "ZonePlayer 120," and "ZonePlayer 90," which are offered by Sonos, Inc.  of Santa Barbara, Calif.  A zone player may also be referred to herein as a playback device, and a zone
player is not limited to the particular examples illustrated in FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C.  For example, a zone player may include a wired or wireless headphone.  In another example, a zone player might include a subwoofer.  In an example, a zone player may
include or interact with a docking station for an Apple iPod.TM.  or similar device.  In some embodiments, a zone player may relay one or more signals received from, for example, a first zone player to another playback device.  In some embodiments, a
zone player may receive a first signal and generate an output corresponding to the first signal and, simultaneously or separately, may receive a second signal and transmit or relay the second signal to another zone player(s), speaker(s), receiver(s),
etc. Thus, an example zone player described herein can act as a playback device and, at the same time, operate as a hub in a network of zone players.  In such instances, media content corresponding to the first signal may be different from the media
content corresponding to the second signal.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 shows an example illustration of a wireless controller 300 in a docking station 302.  The controller 300 may correspond to the controlling device 130 of FIG. 1.  The controller 300 is provided with a touch screen 304 that allows a user to
interact with the controller 300 to, for example, retrieve and navigate a playlist of audio items, control operations of one or more zone players, and provide overall control of the system configuration 100.  In addition, the controller 300 may provide a
social portal through which users can share, among other things, playlists with users of other households.  In certain embodiments, any number of controllers may be used to control the system configuration 100.  In certain embodiments, there may be a
limit on the number of controllers that can control the system configuration 100.  The controllers might be wireless like wireless controller 300 or wired to the data network 128.  Furthermore, an application running on any network-enabled portable
devices, such as an iPhone.TM., iPad.TM., Android.TM.  powered phone, or any other smart phone or network-enabled device may be used as a controller by connecting to the data network 128.  An application running on a laptop or desktop PC or Mac may also
be used as a controller.  Example controllers include a "Sonos.RTM.  Controller 200," "Sonos.RTM.  Controller for iPhone," "Sonos.RTM.  Controller for iPad," "Sonos.RTM.  Controller for Android, "Sonos.RTM.  Controller for Mac or PC," which are offered
by Sonos, Inc.  of Santa Barbara, Calif.
<br/><br/> Referring back to the system configuration 100 of FIG. 1, a particular zone may contain one or more zone players.  For example, the family room of FIG. 1 contains two zone players 106 and 108, while the kitchen is shown with one zone player 102. Zones may be dynamically configured by positioning a zone player in a room or space and assigning via the controller 130 the zone player to a new or existing zone.  As such, zones may be created, combined with another zone, removed, and given a specific
name (e.g., "Kitchen"), if so programmed.  The zone players 102 to 124 are coupled directly or indirectly to a data network, such as the data network 128 shown in FIG. 1.  The data network 128 is represented by an octagon in the figure to stand out from
other components shown in the figure.  While the data network 128 is shown in a single location, it is understood that such a network may be distributed in and around the system configuration 100.
<br/><br/> Particularly, the data network 128 may be a wired network, a wireless network, or a combination of both.  In some embodiments, one or more of the zone players 102-124 are wirelessly coupled to the data network 128 based on a proprietary mesh
network.  In some embodiments, one or more of the zone players 102-124 are wirelessly coupled to the data network 128 using a non-mesh topology.  In some embodiments, one or more of the zone players 102-124 are coupled via a wire to the data network 128
using Ethernet or similar technology.  In addition to the one or more zone players 102-124 connecting to the data network 128, the data network 128 may further allow access to a wide area network, such as the Internet.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, the data network 128 may be created by connecting any of the zone players 102-124, or some other connecting device, to a broadband router.  Other zone players 102-124 may then be added wired or wirelessly to the data
network 128.  For example, a zone player (e.g., any of zone players 102-124) may be added to the system configuration 100 by simply pressing a button on the zone player itself, which enables a connection to be made to the data network 128.  The broadband
router may be connected to an Internet Service Provider (ISP), for example.  The broadband router may be used to form another data network within the system configuration 100, which may be used in other applications (e.g., web surfing).  The data network
128 may also be used in other applications, if so programmed.  Further, in certain embodiments, the data network 128 is the same network used for other applications in the household.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, each zone can play from the same audio source as another zone or each zone can play from a different audio source.  For example, someone can be grilling on the patio and listening to jazz music via zone player 124, while
someone is preparing food in the kitchen and listening to classical music via zone player 102.  Further, someone can be in the office listening to the same jazz music via zone player 110 that is playing on the patio via zone player 124.  In some
embodiments, the jazz music played via zone players 110 and 124 is played in synchrony.  Synchronizing playback amongst zones allows for someone to pass through zones while seamlessly listening to the audio.  Further, zones may be put into a "party mode"
such that all associated zones will play audio in synchrony.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, a zone contains two or more zone players.  For example, the family room contains two zone players 106 and 108, and the home theater room contains at least zone players 116, 118, and 120.  A zone may be configured to
contain as many zone players as desired, and for example, the home theater room might contain additional zone players to play audio from a 5.1 channel or greater audio source (e.g., a movie encoded with 5.1 or greater audio channels).  If a zone contains
two or more zone players, such as the two zone players 106 and 108 in the family room, then the two zone players 106 and 108 may be configured to play the same audio source in synchrony, or the two zone players 106 and 108 may be paired to play two
separate sounds in left and right channels, for example.  In other words, the stereo effects of a sound may be reproduced or enhanced through the two zone players 106 and 108, one for the left sound and the other for the right sound.  In certain
embodiments, paired zone players may play audio in synchrony with other zone players.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, three or more zone players may be configured to play various channels of audio that is encoded with three channels or more sound.  For example, the home theater room shows zone players 116, 118, and 120.  If the sound is
encoded as 2.1 channel audio, then the zone player 116 may be configured to play left channel audio, the zone player 118 may be configured to play right channel audio, and the zone player 120 may be configured to play bass frequencies.  Other
configurations are possible and depend on the number of zone players and the type of audio.  Further, a particular zone may be configured to play a 5.1 channel audio in one instance, such as when playing audio from a movie, and then dynamically switch to
play stereo, such as when playing audio from a two channel source.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, two or more zone players may be sonically consolidated to form a single, consolidated zone player.  A consolidated zone player (though made up of multiple, separate devices) may be configured to process and reproduce
sound differently than an unconsolidated zone player or zone players that are paired, because a consolidated zone player will have additional speaker drivers from which sound may be passed.  The consolidated zone player may further be paired with a
single zone player or yet another consolidated zone player.  Each playback device of a consolidated playback device is preferably set in a consolidated mode.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, one can continue to do any of: group, consolidate, and pair zone players, for example, until a desired configuration is complete.  The actions of grouping, consolidation, and pairing are preferably performed
through a control interface, such as using controller 130, and not by physically connecting and re-connecting speaker wire, for example, to individual, discrete speakers to create different configurations.  As such, certain embodiments described herein
provide a more flexible and dynamic platform through which sound reproduction can be offered to the end-user.
<br/><br/> Sources of audio content to be played by zone players 102-124 are numerous.  Music from a personal library stored on a computer or networked-attached storage (NAS) may be accessed via the data network 128 and played.  Internet radio stations,
shows, and podcasts may be accessed via the data network 128.  Music services that let a user stream and download music and audio content may be accessed via the data network 128.  Further, music may be obtained from traditional sources, such as a
turntable or CD player, via a line-in connection to a zone player, for example.  Audio content may also be accessed through AirPlay.TM.  wireless technology by Apple, Inc., for example.  Audio content received from one or more sources may be shared
amongst the zone players 102 to 124 via the data network 128 and/or the controller 130.
<br/><br/> Regardless of where a user of the system configuration 100 obtains access to his or her audio, the user may share his or her listening experience with a user of a different system configuration, such as a different household.  As such, an
account holder on a subscription service may share songs with account holders of other subscriptions services.  In addition, search capabilities allow songs to be shared across music services or in a local library, by searching for the artist, album,
and/or title.
<br/><br/> III.  Example Media Share System
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 4, there is shown an example functional block diagram of a file or media share or match system 400 in accordance with an embodiment.  The file share system 400 may be used, for example, by a user operating any of the zone
players 102-124 of FIG. 1.  The file share system 400, or aspects thereof, may be used, for example, by a user of a social networking service that may be independent of the system configuration 100 of FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> The example system 400 includes a plurality of users, e.g., a first user 402 and a second user 404 that are communicatively coupled to an intermediary 406.  The first user 402, the second user 404 and the intermediary 406 are coupled via
communication lines 408, which may be, for example, any suitable cable or wireless based communication lines.  The first user 402, second user 404 and intermediary 406 may communicate in accordance with any suitable communications protocol including, for
example, the Music Open Application Programming Interface (MOAPI).  Also, though two users 402, 404 are shown in FIG. 4 any number of users may be communicatively coupled to the intermediary 406.
<br/><br/> The example intermediary 406 may be, for example, an online social network and/or file sharing service system that is interconnected between the plurality of users 402, 404.  The intermediary 406 may be a web-based subsystem and/or may be
applications installed at the users 402, 404.  In the example of FIG. 4, the intermediary 406 includes an interface 410, which is used to communicate with the first user 402, the second user 404 and a network database 412 as described in more detail
below.  In addition, the first user 402 includes a first interface 414, and the second user 404 includes a second interface 416, which are used to facilitate interaction between each of the first user 402 and the second user 404 and the system 400,
respectively.
<br/><br/> In the example system 400, the first user 402 has a playback device 418, which is any type of device that is used to view, hear, handle, operate, consume or otherwise utilize a file.  An example playback device 418 may be the controller 300
described above and/or a computer, a mobile phone, an MP3 player, a tablet, a stereo, a radio, a television or any other suitable device.  The file may be, for example, a musical file, a video, a newspaper article, a book, a magazine or any other media. 
Example musical files include a musical track, an artist, an album a playlist or a genre.  The first user includes a library or local database 420 that may store the file.  However, in some example, the local database 420 stores an identification of the
file and the file is located elsewhere including, for example, on the network database 412, which may be, for example, the Internet.  The first user is coupled to the network database 412 via the communication lines 408 discussed above.  Also, the second
user 404 includes a second playback device 422 and second local database 424, which correlate with features described with respect to the first playback device 418 and first local database 420.
<br/><br/> The example playback device 418 operates a service to provide the first user access to the file.  For example, the playback device 418 may operate one or more free or paid subscription-based services such as, for example, Spotify.TM.  or
Rhapsody.TM.  online streaming music services, Pandora.RTM.  or Last.fm Internet radio music recommendation services or other radio services.  The playback device 418 may also operate using files from the local database 420 such as, for example, iTunes
or any other media player computer program.  In addition, the playback device 418 may obtain and display files from any website including, for example, YouTube or any other online file sharing website or repository.  Also, the playback device 418 may
interact with online vendors to obtain files including, for example iTune Store or Napster.TM..
<br/><br/> In an example operation of the example system 400, the first user 402 uses the playback device 418 to consume a first file (e.g., listen to a music track).  The first user 402 may wish to recommend the file to the second user 404 or generally
recommend the file to any other user in his network or anyone in the public.  For example, the first user 402 may wish to recommend a specific music, an entire album, the work of an artist, a particular playlist of music tracks and/or a specific genre of
music.  In some embodiments, the first user 402 enters an indication that he wants recommend the file, which is transmitted via the interface 414 and communication line 408 to the intermediary 406, which receives the recommendation at the interface 410. 
The intermediary 406 includes a verifier 426 that detects the service used by the first user.  When the service has been detected, an encoder 428 associates a service identification code with the file recommendation based on the service used by the first
user 402.
<br/><br/> If the recommendation does not name a specific user to whom the recommendation was made, the intermediary 406 may communicate the recommendation for a period of time or perpetually generally to the public or a network of friends of the first
user 402.  If a user (e.g., the second user 404) wants to investigate the recommendation, i.e., download and consume the file, the second user 404 can send a request for the file via the interface 410 and communication line 408 to the intermediary 406,
which is received at the interface 410.  The verifier 426 then investigates the second user 404 to determine what service the second user operates to access files.  Additionally or alternatively, if the recommendation included a specifically named user
(e.g., the second user 404), the verifier 426 could automatically investigate the second user 404 to determine what service the second user operates without waiting for a file request from the second user 404.
<br/><br/> The intermediary 406 includes a playback engine 430 to provide the file recommendation with the first service identification code to the second user 404 where the second service and the first service are the same service.  Thus, if the first
user 402 uses First Service A (e.g., Spotify.TM.) and the second user 404 also uses First Service A (i.e., Spotify.TM.) then the intermediary 406, via the playback engine 430, will pass the file recommendation with the First Service A identification
encoded therein to the second user 404, who can then obtain the file via First Service A and consume the file upon receipt.
<br/><br/> When the verifier 426 determines that the second user 404 uses Second Service B (e.g., Rhapsody.TM.), the intermediary 406 takes steps to connect the second user 404 with the file because the First Service A encoded file recommendation will not
translate to Second Service B. That is, the Second Service B will not recognize the file recommendation because of the First Service A identification.  In this example, a searcher 432 searches a local library (e.g., the local database 424) or a
network-accessible database (e.g., the Internet) for a second service identification code to associate with the file based on the Second Service B. When located, the encoder associates the second service identification code with the file.  In addition,
the playback engine 430 provides the file recommendation with the Second Service B identification code to the second user 404.  With the recommendation and a recognizable code, Second Service B can locate and present the file to the second user 404.  In
some examples, the searcher 432 searches the local library (e.g., the local database 424) or the network-accessible database (e.g., the Internet) for the file based on metadata related to the file such as for example, data identifying the title, artist
and/or album, regardless of the Second Service B.
<br/><br/> When the verifier 426 determines that the second user 404 does not use any service, the intermediary 406 takes steps to connect the second user 404 with the file because the First Service A encoded file recommendation will not translate to a
serviceless media player at the second user 404.  In this example, the searcher 432 obtains metadata related to the file such as for example, data identifying the title, artist and/or album.  With the appropriate metadata, the intermediary 406 can locate
the file in the network database 412, obtain the file and present it to the second user 404.
<br/><br/> The example intermediary 406 also includes a central database 434 to store a record associating the first service identification code, the second service identification code and/or the metadata with the file recommendation.  Thus, in some
examples, if the first user 402 and the second user 404 user different services, the intermediary 406 can check the central database 434 to determine if a translation between the different service identification codes was previously mapped, which will
save the searcher 432 from having to access the network database 412.
<br/><br/> The database may also include a mapping of a list of friends or connections for each user 402, 404 and, therefore, host a social network for the users 402, 404.  Furthermore, the example intermediary 406 may include an updater 436 that
dynamically informs the users 402, 404 of additional file recommendations recommended by any of the connections in the users' respective networks.  The updater 434 periodically checks the connections for new recommendations or receives the
recommendations in real time.
<br/><br/> Each user 402, 404 can also search inside and outside of their respective social networks for recommendations and/or for further members as potential connections.  For example, a user could browse for members and, for each member, manage the
connection (e.g., invite the member to be a connection, ignore an invitation or delete a connection), view the member's file (e.g., track, artist, album and/or genre) recommendations.  Each user can also browse for file recommended by a specific
connection or by all their connections in general.  In addition, the users can browse for file recommendations by the entire community, i.e., even those member to whom the user is not connected.  The file recommendation searches can be particular to a
specific type of file such as, for example, track, artist, album and/or genre.  In addition, the searching hierarchy may include a browse node that is a no-op.  For example, when an affirmation is made to connect with a member, the intermediary 406 could
act to search for recommendations through the new connection's history or otherwise take no other action.
<br/><br/> In some examples, when a recommendation citing a specific user is received at the intermediary 406, the playback engine 430 can automatically add the file, via the service identification and recommendation, to a playlist at a playback device of
the specified user.  In some examples, the playlist is currently playing.  That is, in some examples, if a first user 402 recommends a file (e.g., a song) for the second user 404, the playback engine 430 will queue the song for immediate play at the
playback device 422 of the second user 404.
<br/><br/> In addition, as described in below, the interfaces 410, 414, 416 receive an indication of the enjoyment level of the users 402, 404 with respect to the file, or any other file.  The searcher 432 may search for additional file recommendations
based on the enjoyment level.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a flowchart representative of example machine readable instructions that may be executed to implement the example system 400, the example intermediary 406, the example interface 410, the example verifier 426, the example encoder 428,
the example searcher 432, the example playback engine 430, the example database 434, the example updater 436 and other components of FIG. 4.  In the examples of FIG. 5, the machine readable instructions include a program for execution by a processor such
as the processor 712 shown in the example computer 700 discussed below in connection with FIG. 7.  The program may be embodied in software stored on a computer readable medium such as a CD-ROM, a floppy disk, a hard drive, a digital versatile disk (DVD),
or a memory associated with the processor 712, but the entire program and/or parts thereof could alternatively be executed by a device other than the processor 712 and/or embodied in firmware or dedicated hardware.  Further, although the example program
is described with reference to the flowchart illustrated in FIG. 5, many other methods of implementing the example system 400, the example intermediary 406, the example interface 410, the example verifier 426, the example encoder 428, the example
searcher 432, the example playback engine 430, the example database 434, the example updater 436 and other components of FIG. 4 may alternatively be used.  For example, the order of execution of the blocks may be changed, and/or some of the blocks
described may be changed, eliminated, or combined.
<br/><br/> As mentioned above, the example processes of FIG. 5 may be implemented using coded instructions (e.g., computer readable instructions) stored on a tangible computer readable medium such as a hard disk drive, a flash memory, a read-only memory
(ROM), a compact disk (CD), a digital versatile disk (DVD), a cache, a random-access memory (RAM) and/or any other storage media in which information is stored for any duration (e.g., for extended time periods, permanently, brief instances, for
temporarily buffering, and/or for caching of the information).  As used herein, the term tangible computer readable medium is expressly defined to include any type of computer readable storage and to exclude propagating signals.  Additionally or
alternatively, the example processes of FIG. 5 may be implemented using coded instructions (e.g., computer readable instructions) stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium such as a hard disk drive, a flash memory, a read-only memory, a compact
disk, a digital versatile disk, a cache, a random-access memory and/or any other storage media in which information is stored for any duration (e.g., for extended time periods, permanently, brief instances, for temporarily buffering, and/or for caching
of the information).  As used herein, the term non-transitory computer readable medium is expressly defined to include any type of computer readable medium and to exclude propagating signals.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates an example method of sharing or matching a file or media (block 500).  The example method 500 may be used to recommend a file such as a music track from one user to another user.  When a first user (e.g., the first user 402 of
FIG. 4) recommends a file (e.g., a music track) a file recommendation is submitted, and the example method 500 verifies the first service used by the first user to access the file (block 502).  The file recommendation is encoded (e.g., by the encoder 428
of FIG. 4) with a first service identification based on the first service (block 504).  The file recommendation is stored with the first identification code in a database (e.g., the database 434) (block 506).
<br/><br/> A "reference" or "recommendation" from a user may be an active reference or recommendation.  For example, the user may explicitly offer a particular recommendation (e.g., "John likes `Our Love is Here to Stay` by Bill Evans").  In some
embodiments, a "reference" or "recommendation" may be based on some other defined criteria, if the user allows such information to be shared.  For example, the user's listening habits using a device of the sort described with respect to the system
configuration 100 might be tracked and offered as a user specific recommendation (e.g., "John listens to `Seal it With a Kiss` by Britney Spears") or a general public-type recommendation.  That is, the system may track what the user is actually listening
to through the system (a benefit of this embodiment can include a wider range of listening data, because the audio may come from a number of different sources and be played through the system) and provide that information in the form of a reference
recommendation.  Regardless of whether the reference or recommendation is an active or not, the reference or recommendation may be made in real-time (as the user is listening to the music) if so desired.
<br/><br/> The example method 500 determines if a second user (e.g., the second user 404) is mentioned in the file recommendation by the first user (block 508).  If the second user is mentioned by the first user in the file recommendation, the process 500
continues to verify the second service used by the second user to access files (block 510).  The process 500 determines if the second service is the same as the first service (block 512).  If the second service is the same as the first service, i.e., if
both the first user and the second user use the same service to access files (e.g., play streaming music), the file recommendation with the first service ID (which would be the same as or substantially similar to the second service ID in this example) is
sent to the second user and the file is queued for consumption (e.g., play) by the second user (block 514).  The first service identification code may include a URL, tinyURL and/or any other suitable pointer to the file.  The process 500 then ends (block
516) until the next recommendation is received or another recommendation is processed.
<br/><br/> If, when the second service of the second user is verified (block 510), it is determined that the second service of the second user is not the same as the first service used by the first user (block 512), the process determines if any second
service exists, i.e., if the second user uses any particular service for accessing files (block 518).  If the second user does not use or subscribe to a second service (or the first service), the process 500 searches for the recommended file via metadata
that is associated with or encoded with the file recommendation by, for example, the encoder 428 of FIG. 4 (block 520) so that the process 500 can connect the second user with the recommended file by matching the file recommended by the first user using
the first service with the file as hosted by an alternative service.  In some examples, the process 500 searches using, for example, a music track title, on a free music access service.  When the recommended file is located, the file is downloaded and/or
a link to the file is sent to the second user, and the file is queued for consumption by the second user (block 522).  The process 500 then ends (block 516) until the next recommendation is received or another recommendation is processed.
<br/><br/> If, when the second service of the second user is verified (block 510), it is determined that the second service of the second user is not the same as the first service used by the first user (block 512) and the second service exists, i.e., the
second user uses a second, different, service to access files (block 518), the process 500 searches (e.g., with the searcher 432) for a second service identification code for the recommended file (block 524).  The second service identification code may
include a URL, tinyURL and/or any other suitable pointer to the file.  The file recommendation is encoded with the second service identification (block 526) using, for example, the encoder 428 so that the process 500 can connect the second user with the
recommended file by matching the file recommended by the first user using the first service with the file as hosted by the second service.  In addition, the file recommendation with the second service identification is stored (block 528) in, for example,
the database 434.  In some examples, the database 434 may serve as a translator between two services to match files between the two services if, for example, the database 434 includes service codes for two services related to the same recommended file. 
The process 500 then sends the second service identification and associated file recommendation to the second user and queues the recommended file for consumption by the second user (block 530).  The process 500 then ends (block 516) until the next
recommendation is received or another recommendation is processed.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the process 500 does not search for a second service identification code even though the second user uses a second service to access files.  In such embodiments, the process 500 may identify the file from the file
recommendation such as, for example, via the first service identification or metadata, and the process 500 may use the second service to access the file.  Thus, after determining that the second service exists (block 518), the example process 500 may
search for the file or a pointer to the file using metadata (block 520).  For example, after reading the file recommendation for a music track, the process 500 may determine the title, author and/or album of the recommended music track.  With this
information, the process 500 can access the second service to obtain or locate the recommended music track so that the process 500 can connect the second user with the recommended file by matching the file recommended by the first user using the first
service with the file as hosted by the second service without obtaining or employing a second service identification code.  In this example, the process 500 may also search for the file or a pointer to the file on a free service, regardless of the
presence of the second service.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the process 500 determines that the second user is not mentioned in the file recommendation (block 508).  For example, the first user may indicate that he likes a certain file, he may recommend the file to no other user in
particular but, rather, to the network or community at large, or the user's currently used files (e.g., currently played music tracks) are automatically mentioned in a file recommendation.  When no second user is identified in a file recommendation
(block 508), the example process 500 determines if a second user (or third user, fourth user, etc.) requests the recommended file (block 532).  If a second user requests the recommended file, control of the example process 500 returns to block 510 where
the second service of the second user is verified.  If a second user does not request the recommended file, the process 500 will sit idle (for this particular file recommendation) (block 534) until it is determined that a second user requests the
recommended file (block 532).
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 shows an example graphical user interface 600, which may be implemented, for example on the playback devices 418, 422 of the first and second user 402, 404, respectively and/or the controller 300 described above.  The example graphical
user interface 600 shows a screen with several panels including a file control panel 602, a current status panel 604, a queue panel 606, a network update panel 608 and a network list panel 610.  Any number of panels may be added, removed, rearranged etc.
to create any type of graphical user interface.  In addition, each user may customize the graphical user interface for his or her particular needs and/or preferences.
<br/><br/> The control panel 602 includes buttons or keys to control the use of a file including, for example, playing, stopping or pausing of a music track, skipping to the next track, repeating a track and controlling a volume.
<br/><br/> Current status panel 604 shows a file that is currently being used.  The current status panel 604 also includes an icon or button 612 that the user can activate to indicate that a file is enjoyed.  The current status panel 604 also includes an
icon or button 614 to indicate that the user would like to recommend the current file.  If the user activates the recommend button 616, the user may be prompted to provide additional information such as, for example, a specific user to whom the user
wants to recommend the file.
<br/><br/> The queue panel 606 shows other files that are in position for being used.  The queue may change dynamically, for example, based on the acceptance or receipt of a recommended file as detailed above.  In addition, the queue panel 606 includes
icons 616 to indicate that a user likes a specific file and recommend buttons 618 to recommend the file, though the file is not currently being used or consumed.
<br/><br/> The network update panel 608 shows recent activity of connections in the user's network.  Though only one activity is shown in the graphical user interface 600 of FIG. 6, any number of activities including, for example, a scrolling thread may
appear as well.  The network update panel 608 in this example shows that a friend or connection (e.g., Friend 1) likes a certain file (e.g., X music track).  The user is prompted in the network update panel 608 to request the file if desired by
activating the request icon 620.  The network update panel 608 may include information related to recommendation made specifically to the user or any other activity in the user's network or that is otherwise public including, for example, activity
between two of the user's connections.
<br/><br/> The network list panel 610 shows a list of the friends or connections in the user's network.  In the example, friends F1-F10 are shown, but the network list panel 610 could include a scrolling list.  In addition, the user may interact with or
view history activity of the connections listed in the network list panel 610 by selecting a particular connection.  In addition, the user may provide recommended files for a particular connection by dragging a file name and dropping on the connection's
name.  One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the example graphical user interface 600 of FIG. 6 may be manipulated and altered in many ways.
<br/><br/> As described above, certain embodiments disclosed herein enable media sharing such as, for example, music sharing in a social context that includes cross-linking, i.e., matching music or other media files between different media access services. Traditional social networks such as, for example, Twitter or <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> are directed to sharing textual information, i.e., a text string that indicates what a user is doing, what a user enjoys, what music a user is listening to, etc. The examples
disclosed herein allow the actual music file to be shared and/or allow a music file to be matched between different music access services.  These examples may be implemented using web-accessible systems including, for example, the systems of FIGS. 1-4,
described above.  In these examples, one account holder or user using a first music service including subscription-based services (e.g., Rhapsody) may share songs with other account holder, and the systems described herein include search capabilities
that enable sharing and/or matching of music across music services or in a local library by searching, for example, an artist, a title and/or an album.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, a MOAPI (Music Open Application Programming Interface) based music service is established.  Users that wish to join the service request an account.  In some examples, there is no initial web page to go to first to create
credentials, a user can choose a username and password from a controller, which, if available, becomes the user's account.  In some examples, a standard like Open Auth (Initiative for Open Authentication) may be employed.
<br/><br/> In some examples, on a `Now Playing` screen (e.g., the interface 600 of FIG. 6), a user can choose to "recommend" media (e.g., an artist/album/track).  The recommendation initiates one or more transactions including, for example, adding or
encoding a service-specific identifier to a database for the user's connections.  Thus, if a user recommends a file in from one service (e.g., a Rhapsody track), the example systems and methods described herein encodes the first service identification
code (e.g. Rhapsody ID) in the recommendation, so that when any of the user's connections sees what the user recommended, the recommended file (e.g., music track) will play if the connection happens to have the same file access service (i.e., in this
example, Rhapsody).  Firmware adaptations may be used to execute web-based searches and/or to decode any encoded service identification codes.
<br/><br/> In some examples, as described above, the system boasts an address book, which includes a list of the connections of a user.  In some examples, the address book is stored at a central server (e.g., at the central database 434).
<br/><br/> In some examples, a user's connections may not use the same service to access files that the user uses.  For example, one connection of the user may use the Spotify service to access and/or play music tracks while the user uses the Rhapsody
service.  In some examples, the example system allows for files (e.g., music tracks) on one service to be played on another via one or more of the searches described herein.  For example, when system (e.g., the intermediary 406) receives an
identification for a shared track (e.g., a recommended music track) from the user and discovers (e.g., via the verifier 426) that the connection (i.e., second user) does not have a subscription to the first service (e.g., the connection does not
subscribe to Rhapsody), the system may request metadata (e.g., album, artist and/or title) for the music track and conduct a search on whatever service the connection uses (in this example, Spotify) and/or also search the connection's local library.
<br/><br/> In addition, in some examples, a list of files (e.g., artists/albums/tracks) that the connections of a user have recommended is treated by the system (e.g., by the intermediary 406) as a library item.  This facilitates the dynamic updating of
what a user's connections have recommended as the recommendations occur.  An example search via a user's connections may include:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 Friends Search Members &lt;member username&gt; Invite to be my Friend Artist Recommendations Album Recommendations Track Recommendations Artists Recommended by my Friends Albums Recommended by my Friends Tracks Recommended by my
Friends My Friends &lt;friend username&gt; Artist Recommendations &lt;Artists&gt; &lt;Albums&gt; &lt;Tracks&gt; Album Recommendations &lt;Albums&gt; &lt;Tracks&gt; Track Recommendations &lt;Tracks&gt; Artist Recommendations &lt;Artists&gt; &lt;Albums&gt;
&lt;Tracks&gt; Album Recommendations &lt;Albums&gt; &lt;Tracks&gt; Track Recommendations &lt;Tracks&gt; Friend Requests &lt;member username&gt; Allow Ignore
<br/><br/> In some examples, to implement this browse hierarchy no-op browse node may be used.  Also, when a user clicks on "Allow" for a friend request, for example, the server (e.g., the intermediary 406) could implement a search related to the newly
accepted friend/connection including, for example, file recommendations.
<br/><br/> In some examples, when a user browses into artists/albums/track, the identifications that are provided to the system may include the specially encoded identifications described herein that specifically include the music service.  In addition, in
some examples, the encoding may even include the service name with the track title, e.g., "Track name (on Rhapsody)".
<br/><br/> In some examples, a file recommendation is created and/or transmitted to a user's network and/or to other social networks the user is associated with for files added to a queue or played.  For example, a user may also have a Twitter account and
a communication (such as, for example, a tweet on Twitter) may be sent for any or all music tracks added to a user's queue and/or for any or all track a user plays.  Also, in some examples, the systems described herein may send communications to other
social networks and/or receive communications therefrom.  For example, the intermediary 406 may act as a Twitter sender where the receipt of the tweet occurs in the usual way (e.g. mobile phone or web browser).  In some examples, the example intermediary
406 may act as a Twitter receiver to allow the recipient (e.g., the user) to directly add a recommended track or album to his or her library or queue.
<br/><br/> Also, as detailed above, in some examples, users opt-in to a system/service by publishing a username and profile and adding other users to a connections/friends list, which includes a feature or process for finding friends, approving adding a
friend, and syncing or updating friend lists.
<br/><br/> In some examples, when a user plays a track, the systems described herein provide a feature or process to share the music with one or more friend(s).  Also, in some examples, the systems described herein obtain music the user's friends shared
with the user.  In some examples, the user may press or click a button on his or her controller to "recommend" a track, album, artist, station (e.g., Pandora, Last.FM, or other radio station) to his or her friends (i.e., connections or followers).  For
example, if a user is listening to a track on Rhapsody and presses the "recommend" button, a menu may appears that offers the user additional options for instigating and/or customizing the recommendation including, for example, an indication to choose to
recommend the track, an indication to choose to recommend the album, an indication to choose to recommend to artist, an indication to choose to recommend the station, etc. The user could also choose to send a customize message with the recommendation
throughout the network, to a particular other user and/or to another network (e.g., <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or Twitter) such as, for example one or more tweets that broadcast the recommendation (e.g., "I'm enjoying the track `Knock 'Em Out` on the Album `Alright,
Still` by Lily Allen on my Sonos system."; "I'm enjoying the Album `Alright, Still` by Lily Allen on my Sonos system."; "I'm enjoying listening to Lily Allen on my Sonos system."; and/or "I'm enjoying listening to Bruce Springsteen Radio on my Sonos
system.").
<br/><br/> In some examples, the example systems include an interface to enable the user to input account information for other social network sites (e.g., for the user to enter Twitter or <b><i>Facebook</i></b> account information).  Also, in some examples, the example
system includes a user interface button on, for example, a "Now Playing" screen that guides the user through menu options, as described above.  In addition, in some examples, the example system includes a common code that takes the request arguments or
recommendation and sends an API to the other social networks coupled to the user's account.  Also, in some examples, an option is included for the user to provide a preference to indicate which of any other social networks coupled to the user's account
to send recommendations (e.g., to Twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> or both).
<br/><br/> In some examples, the example system adapts the recommendation to a format associated with any other social network including, for example, limiting recommendations to 140 characters or less for Twitter.  Also, in some examples, the example
system automatically, includes URLs for the recommended track/station streams and/or tinyURLs (e.g., for Twitter).
<br/><br/> The example systems and methods described herein also enable users across various geographic territories including, for example, different countries to share files.  For example, a user in the US could recommend a music track to a user in Sweden
(regardless of the services each user uses to access music, as detailed above), and the user in Sweden could use the recommendation to queue, point to, obtain, download, play or comment about the music track.  In some examples, the example system enables
the sharing or matching of files despite licensing agreements containing territory-specific restrictions on the files (e.g., songs) because the example system uses the second service used by the recipient/second user to match the recommended file with a
file in the second service and, thus, in accordance with the user license obtained by the second user with the second service.  Thus, in such examples, a global mapping system is applied.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a block diagram of an example computer 700 capable of executing the instructions of FIG. 5 to implement the example system 400, the example intermediary 406, the example interface 410, the example verifier 426, the example encoder 428,
the example searcher 432, the example playback engine 430, the example database 434, the example updater 436 and other components of FIG. 4.  The computer 700 can be, for example, a server, a personal computer, a mobile phone (e.g., a cell phone), a
personal digital assistant (PDA), an Internet appliance, a set top box, or any other type of computing device.
<br/><br/> The computer 700 of the instant example includes a processor 712.  For example, the processor 712 can be implemented by one or more Intel.RTM.  microprocessors from the Pentium.RTM.  family, the Itanium.RTM.  family or the XScale.RTM.  family. 
Of course, other processors from other families are also appropriate.
<br/><br/> The processor 712 is in communication with a main memory including a volatile memory 714 and a non-volatile memory 716 via a bus 718.  The volatile memory 714 may be implemented by Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM), Dynamic Random
Access Memory (DRAM), RAMBUS Dynamic Random Access Memory (RDRAM) and/or any other type of random access memory device.  The non-volatile memory 716 may be implemented by flash memory and/or any other desired type of memory device.  Access to the main
memory 714, 716 is typically controlled by a memory controller (not shown).
<br/><br/> The computer 700 also includes an interface circuit 720.  The interface circuit 720 may be implemented by any type of interface standard, such as an Ethernet interface, a universal serial bus (USB), and/or a PCI express interface.
<br/><br/> One or more input devices 722 are connected to the interface circuit 720.  The input device(s) 722 permit a user to enter data and commands into the processor 712.  The input device(s) can be implemented by, for example, a keyboard, a mouse, a
touchscreen, a track-pad, a trackball, isopoint and/or a voice recognition system.
<br/><br/> One or more output devices 724 are also connected to the interface circuit 720.  The output devices 724 can be implemented, for example, by display devices (e.g., a liquid crystal display, a cathode ray tube display (CRT), a printer and/or
speakers).  The interface circuit 720, thus, typically includes a graphics driver card.
<br/><br/> The interface circuit 720 also includes a communication device (e.g., the request servicer) such as a modem or network interface card to facilitate exchange of data with external computers via a network 726 (e.g., an Ethernet connection, a
digital subscriber line (DSL), a telephone line, coaxial cable, a cellular telephone system, etc.).
<br/><br/> The computer 700 also includes one or more mass storage devices 728 for storing software and data.  Examples of such mass storage devices 728 include floppy disk drives, hard drive disks, compact disk drives, and digital versatile disk (DVD)
drives.  The mass storage device 728 may implement the storage database 420, 424, 434.
<br/><br/> The coded instructions of FIG. 7 may be stored in the mass storage device 728, in the volatile memory 714, in the non-volatile memory 716, and/or on a removable storage medium such as a CD or DVD.
<br/><br/> Various inventions have been described in sufficient detail with a certain degree of particularity.  It is understood to those skilled in the art that the present disclosure of embodiments has been made by way of examples only and that numerous
changes in the arrangement and combination of parts may be resorted without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure as claimed.  While the embodiments discussed herein may appear to include some limitations as to the presentation of
the information units, in terms of the format and arrangement, the embodiments have applicability well beyond such embodiment, which can be appreciated by those skilled in the art.  Accordingly, the scope of the present disclosure is defined by the
appended claims rather than the forgoing description of embodiments.
