       <p> A digital audio/video (A/V) content can be selected from a data store
     within a computing device. The content can include a vocal free recording
     and a subsequently recorded vocal track generated by a user. A digital
     marker can be embedded into the audio signal of the content. The marker
     can be associated with a time index of the content and a unique user
     identity associated with a device. A different A/V content can be
     identified and can be linked to the marker. The different A/V content can
     be at a symbol, a shape, an audio, a video, and/or a text content. In one
     embodiment, facial gesture and/or motion gesture feedback of a consumer
     can be captured during playback of the digital A/V content. In the
     embodiment, analysis of the feedback can be utilized to generate
     recommendations for improvement of A/V digital content and/or status
     updates.

<br/><br/> The present invention relates to the field of social media and, more particularly, to enhancing karaoke systems utilizing audience sentiment feedback and audio watermarking.
<br/><br/> Karaoke is a world-wide phenomenon which is often performed as a social entertainment where amateur singers sing along to selected music.  Frequently, singers can receive immediate feedback from spectators who evaluate the singer's performance
of a karaoke song.  Unfortunately, the phenomenon has not evolved with today's social networking.  Although social networking is a phenomenon that is currently driving interactions between people, social iterations (e.g., social karaoke Web sites) of
karaoke lack the real-time interaction and feedback often associated with traditional karaoke.  For example, a typical social interaction between individuals using a social karaoke application permits chats to include images and sometimes Web camera
interactions.
<br/><br/> However, there is no integration of multiple user audio, text and video social interactions.  Furthermore, the available social media feedback to the karaoke content does not enable remote users to gather accurate listener responses to their
singing, but relies on the manual social interactions.  Finally, there is no karaoke system which leverages social feedback from listeners to enhance the social karaoke experience.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY
<br/><br/> One aspect of the present invention can include a system, an apparatus, a computer program product, and a method for enhancing karaoke systems utilizing audience sentiment feedback and audio watermarking.  Digital audio/video (A/V) content can
be selected from a data store within a computing device.  The content can include a vocal free recording and a subsequently recorded vocal track generated by a user.  A digital marker can be embedded into the audio signal of the A/V content.  The marker
can be associated with a time index of the A/V content and a unique user identity associated with a computing device.  A different A/V content not previously associated with the digital A/V content can be identified and can be linked to the marker.  The
different A/V content can be at a symbol, a shape, an audio content, a video content, and/or a text content.
<br/><br/> Another aspect of the present invention can include a method, an apparatus, a computer program product, and a system for enhancing karaoke systems utilizing audience sentiment feedback and audio watermarking.  A personalization engine can be
configured to embed a digital marker into the audio signal of a digital A/V content.  The marker can be associated with a time index of the digital A/V content and a unique user identity associated with a computing device.  A data store can be able to
persist at least one of the digital A/V content, a different A/V content, and an audio watermark mapping.
<br/><br/> Yet another aspect of the present invention can include a computer program product that includes a computer readable storage medium having embedded computer usable program code.  The computer usable program code can be configured to select a
karaoke content within a computing device session.  The karaoke content can be a user generated content.  The content can be a form of interactive entertainment in which an amateur singer sings along with a previously recorded music.  A watermark can be
embedded into the karaoke content.  The watermark is associated with a singer or a listener.  The watermark can be tied to an embedded content and/or an action.  The watermark can be associated with a time index of the karaoke content. <br/><br/>BRIEF

<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a set of scenarios 110, 170 for enhancing karaoke systems utilizing audience sentiment feedback and audio watermarking in accordance with an embodiment of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein. 
Scenario 110, 170 can be performed in the context of method 200 and/or system 300.  In scenario 110, 170, a karaoke system 120 can enable an audio watermarking of a karaoke content to permit dynamic personalized content creation feedback.  In one
embodiment, scenario 110, 170 can be associated with a social networking environment and/or platform.  For example, the scenario can occur between users of a social karaoke Web site.  Scenario 110 can illustrate an interaction between two users (e.g.,
singer and a listener) interacting with karaoke content 132.  Scenario 170 can illustrate watermarking of content 132 to create a watermarked content 130.  In one instance, disclosure can leverage input components of devices (e.g., 116, 144) to obtain
feedback 128 which can be utilized to deliver personalized content 118 to a user 112 and provide real-time feedback to a user 140.  For example, a camera of a laptop 116 can be utilized by the disclosure to obtain facial recognition feedback (e.g.,
facial reactions) of a listener hearing a karaoke song (e.g., content 130) performed by a singer 140.
<br/><br/> As used herein, karaoke content 132 can be an audio/video content associated with a musical song.  A song can be a composition for a voice or voices to be performed by singing lyrics.  The content 132 can include lyrics which can be visually
presented within a display and/or interface.  The content 132 can lack a vocal recording (e.g., vocal track) and can be an instrumental audio/video content.  For example, content 132 can be an instrumental rendering of a popular song on a social karaoke
Web site.  Content 132 can be associated with one or more metadata attributes.  Attributes can include, but is not limited to, a song name, an album name, an artist name, a file reference, a genre, a comment, a year, a size, a tempo, a pitch, a last sung
timestamp, a rating, a times sung timestamp, a format, a song identifier, a vocal channel, a graphic channel, a start time, a duration, a track number, and the like.  Content 132 format can conform to a MPEG Part 3 (MP3) format, MPEG-4 format, an
Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) format, a VORIBS format, and the like.
<br/><br/> It should be appreciated that the disclosure leverages audio watermarking (e.g., small marker/code embedded into the karaoke content) to perform the functionality described.  That is, because audio watermarking does not require special software
(e.g., unlike tagging using audio fingerprinting) the disclosure is not dependent on user participation to access content linked to the watermark.  An audio watermark 134 can include, but is not limited to, a noise, a tone, a speech, and the like.  For
example, watermark 134 can be a user audio speech segment such as "This is me singing".
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the audio watermark (e.g., watermark 134) can associate a marker in a content stream at a particular timestamp.  In the embodiment, the marker can be associated with unique symbols, shapes, actions, audio, video, and the like,
which can be revealed when the timestamp is reached (e.g., during playback).
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the watermark can enable a security mechanism which can permit/deny modification of karaoke content.  That is, the creator can change content that appended using the watermark but can prevent consumers from changing the
appended content.  In one instance, the watermark can be utilized to permit selected users to view and/or change content 130, 127.
<br/><br/> In scenario 110, a user 140 can interact with a device 142, 144 to create and/or modify a karaoke content 132.  For example, a singer can sing into a microphone of a mobile phone to sing a karaoke song.  During interaction with content 132, user
140 can watermark content utilizing a personal watermark 134.  Personal watermark 134 can be a marker embedded in an audio signal (e.g., karaoke content 132) which can identify ownership of the audio.  For example, watermark 134 can be a word which can
be spoken (e.g., or sung) to watermark a content 132.  It should be appreciated that the disclosure permits a personal watermark associated with a user to enable the addition of content at a later date or enable a user to augment the content with social
media (e.g., images, comments, videos).
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, watermark 134 can be utilized to embed additional content (e.g., embedded content 127) within karaoke content 132.  In the embodiment, additional content can be automatically and/or manually associated with the watermark 134. 
It should be understood that current solutions do not provide for embedding of all types of social media content within the karaoke content (e.g., audio/video stream) using watermarking.  It should be appreciated that system 120 can facilitate the
functionality described in the embodiment.
<br/><br/> Content 130 can be conveyed to karaoke system 120 which can utilize watermarked content 130 to convey personalized content 118 to a user 112.  In one instance, the content 130 can be analyzed to determine relevant metadata which can be utilized
to perform personalized content 118.  In the instance, metadata can be matched against user 112 settings to deliver a personalized user experience.  For example, when a content is a rock song with a heavy drum line is determined the system 120 can match
the song preference of a user (e.g., listens to only heavy rock songs) to metadata associated with the song (e.g., genre, beats per minute, style).  In another instance, content associated with watermark 134 can be utilized to deliver a personalized user
experience.  In the instance, embedded content 127 can be analyzed to determine when the content matches a preference of a user 112.  It should be appreciated that the disclosure is not limited to exact matches and can utilize traditional and/or
proprietary content personalization mechanism to enable the functionality described herein.
<br/><br/> User 112 can utilize a device 114, 116 to interact with content 118 and/or interface 122.  For example, a listener 112 can wear a headset 114 connected to a laptop computer 116 to view a social karaoke Web site interface (e.g., interface 122)
and rate a content 130 or content 118.  Interface 122 can include, but is not limited to, content 130, feedback mechanism 124, content embedding functionality 126, and the like.  In one instance, user 112 can rate portions of content 130 during content
130 playback.  For example, a listener (e.g., user 112) can rate a stanza of a karaoke song sung by a singer (e.g., user 140) utilizing a thumbs up or thumbs down interface button.  In another instance, feedback from user 112 can be automatically
obtained during content 130 playback.  For example, a listener (e.g., user 112) speaking a comment about a note the singer (e.g., user 140) sung can be automatically captured by a microphone on laptop 116.  That is, feedback 128 can be automatically
and/or manually obtained and linked with a time index (e.g., 119) during content 130 playback.  It should be appreciated that feedback 128 automatically and/or manually obtained and can be linked with a time index during content 130 creation.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, biometric feedback can be automatically obtained from a user 112 interacting with the playback of content 118 and/or content 130.  In the embodiment, sensors within devices 114, 116 can be utilized to collect biometric
feedback during content 118, 130 playback.  For example, an accelerometer within headset 114 can be utilized to determine if a listener is moving their head in time with music as playback occurs, which can indicate a positive sentiment.  In one
embodiment, mapping of biometric feedback to audience sentiment can be performed via a sentiment mapping 121.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, mapping 121 can permit the linking of a behavioral biometric feedback with a sentiment.  For example, when a user frowns during playback, the sentiment can be determined as negative.  It should be appreciated that mapping 121
can be arbitrarily complex.  In one instance, mapping 121 can be utilized to distinguish between varying degrees of audience sentiment based on facial gestures.  In one embodiment, values (e.g., mapping elements) within mapping 121 can include numerical
values, fuzzy logic values, alphanumeric values, and the like.  For example, sentiment can be a percentage value (e.g., 90%, 80%) based on a gradient of feedback values (e.g., singing along, humming).
<br/><br/> It should be appreciated that biometric feedback can be collected utilizing traditional and/or proprietary mechanisms.  In one instance, analysis of biometric feedback can be performed utilizing physiological biometric analysis and/or behavioral
biometric analysis.  It should be appreciated that biometric feedback can be utilized to perform automated biometric authentication.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, user 112 can embed content 127 within content 130 during playback.  In the embodiment, a content embedding functionality 126 can be presented in interface 122, enabling content 127 to be embedded within watermarked content 130
at a specific time index.  For example, while listening to a karaoke song performed by a singer, a listener can embed a content via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) link using dialog 126.
<br/><br/> In one instance, playback of the karaoke content can present embedded content to be presented simultaneously.  For example, comments can be presented alongside a song (e.g., karaoke) when a consumer is listening to the song.
<br/><br/> In one instance, feedback 128 can be conveyed to system 120 in real-time during content 130 creation and/or playback.  In the instance, feedback 128 can be analyzed utilizing traditional and/or proprietary mechanism.  In one embodiment,
real-time analytics 136 can be conveyed to user 140.  In the embodiment, analytics 136 can be presented within device 144.  For example, analytics can be presented within an interface 150 while content 130 creation is occurring.  In one instance,
analytics can be presented within utilizing one or more visual graphics.  In the instance, analytics can include a graph, a chart, a visualization, and the like.  For example, an interface 150 can present an graph 152 of an overall audience sentiment of
a content and a text block 154 can present a detailed analytics of a content 130 by time (e.g., at one minute twenty seconds of playback).
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, an interface 160 can present analytics indicating audience sentiment after content 130 creation.  In the embodiment, a notification 162 can provide audience sentiment obtained from biometric sources (e.g., facial recognition,
spoken comments, etc).  For example, feedback 128 from facial responses can be presented within a notification 162 to indicate a positive user sentiment (e.g., "88% of listeners like your singing").
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, facial gestures or movement (e.g., feedback 128) can be collected in real-time during a content 130 creation and/or playback.  In the embodiment, the feedback can be collated and displayed to the user as a dashboard of
audience emotion.
<br/><br/> In one instance, interface 160 can present one or more recommendations for improving content 130.  In the instance, recommendations can include suggested social media updates (e.g., to external social media sites), song preferences, friend
preferences, and the like.  For instance, a recommendation to convey a TWITTER message can include multiple short messages (e.g., less than 140 characters) from which the user 140 can select.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a notification can include a social update which can include messages associated with a social networking Web site.  In the embodiment, the notification can be conveyed to INSTAGRAM, <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> GOOGLE PLUS, and the like.  For
example, an INSTAGRAM update would present a split screen of sets of pictures (e.g., the listeners' reaction, singer's pictures).
<br/><br/> In scenario 170, a watermarked content 130 can include a personal watermark 134 which can enable embedded content 127 to be linked during content 130 creation and/or playback.  Watermark 134 can include, but is not limited to, a reference
identifier, a user identifier, a time index identifier, a content identifier, and the like.  For example, a watermark 134 can be associated with a singer and a singer's favorite quote which can be embedded as content 127.  Content 127 can include, but is
not limited to, an audio content, a video content, a text content, and the like.  It should be appreciated that content 127 can be referenced via a unique identifier (e.g., a URI).  Feedback 128 can include audio feedback, video feedback, facial gesture
feedback, motion gesture feedback, and the like.  In one instance, physical movements associated with a listener can be determined and appropriate feedback can be established.  For example, if a listener 112 dances to a song being sung by singer 140, the
feedback can be established to be positive.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, system 120 can include traditional and/or proprietary audio mixing functionality.  The audio mixing functionality can mix an audio watermark 134 with a content 132 in real-time or near real-time.
<br/><br/> Drawings presented herein are for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed to limit the invention in any regard.  It should be appreciated that the disclosure is not limited to associating feedback/content with time indices and can
associate feedback/content with time intervals.  Watermark 134 properties can include, but is not limited to, signal processing robustness, perceptual quality, bit rate, security, computational complexity, and the like.  It should be appreciated that the
disclosure can utilize spectrum audio watermarking (SSW), amplitude modification, replica method, dither watermarking, self-marking method, and the like.

be present in the context of scenario 110, 170 and/or system 300.  Method 200 can be performed in parallel and/or in serial.  Method 200 can be performed in real-time or near real-time.  In method 200, a personal watermark can be utilized by a singer to
embed media content within a karaoke content and/or provide real-time feedback of the karaoke content.
<br/><br/> In step 205, a karaoke session can be established between a karaoke content creator and a consumer.  In step 210, a karaoke content can be selected by the consumer.  Content selection can be manually and/or automatically selected.  In step 215,
a personal audio watermark can be added to karaoke content by creator.  In one instance, the watermark can be manually added using one or more user interfaces.  For example, a user preferences settings screen can permit a user to select a previously
established audio watermark as a personal watermark to be added to a karaoke content.  In step 220, if the watermark content is owned by the creator, the method can continue to step 225, else proceed to step 230.  In step 225, the watermarking of the
content can be denied.  In step 230, the content can be watermarked and can be augmented with embedded content.  In one embodiment, permission settings can be manually and/or automatically associated with the content.  That is, the watermarked content
can be selectively modified by consumers based on permission settings.  In step 235, the watermarked content can be provided to consumers.  In step 240, biometric and non-biometric feedback from consumers can be collected.  In step 245, feedback from the
consumers can be analyzed.
<br/><br/> In step 250, consumer settings can be updated based on the analysis.  In step 255, feedback can be conveyed to the creator.  In one instance, a recommendation for improving content creation can be conveyed.  In the instance, recommendation can
include consumer feedback (e.g., comments), heuristically generated recommendations, and the like.  For example, a recommendation can suggest a content create can increase the pitch of their voice during a portion of the content to improve consumer
sentiment.
<br/><br/> In step 260, a watermark is added by the consumer and additional content can be embedded if permission settings allow modification.  In step 265, a status update option based on biometric or non-biometric feedback can be received by the
consumer.  In step 270, an update option can be optionally selected by the consumer.  In step 275, the watermarked content can be optionally conveyed to a social media site by the consumer.  In step 280, if the session is terminated the method can
continue to step 285, else return to step 210.  In step 285, the method can end.

In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s).  It should also be noted that, in
some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures.  For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed
in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved.  It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, can be
implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.
