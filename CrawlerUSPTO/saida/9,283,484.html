       <p> Game rhythm in an electronic game can be synchronized, allowing a desired
     emotional state to be achieved. Specifically, a desired emotional state
     of a user playing an electronic game is identified. Then a
     beats-per-minute (bpm) level corresponding to the desired emotional state
     is selected. Game music may then be played at the selected bpm level,
     while animation for one or more game objects within the electronic game
     is synchronized with the selected bpm level. In some example embodiments,
     the game rhythm is synchronized based upon which game object a user
     selects, and there remain some game objects whose animations are
     synchronized at a different bpm level than the selected game object.

<br/><br/> The present disclosure generally relates to games and applications in general and, in particular embodiments, to computer-implemented, online social games.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> In many games, there is a virtual world or some other imagined playing space where a player/user of the game controls one or more player characters (herein "character," "player character," or "PC").  Player characters can be considered in-game
representations of the controlling player.  As used herein, the terms "player," "user," "entity," and "friend" may refer to the in-game player character controlled by that player, user, entity, or friend, unless context suggests otherwise.  The game
display can display a representation of the player character.  A game engine accepts inputs from the player, determines player character actions, decides outcomes of events and presents the player with a game display illuminating what happened.  In some
games, there are multiple players, wherein each player controls one or more player characters.
<br/><br/> In many computer games, there are various types of in-game assets (aka "rewards" or "loot") that a player character can obtain within the game.  For example, a player character may acquire game points, gold coins, experience points, character
levels, character attributes, virtual cash, game keys, or other in-game items of value.  In many computer games, there are also various types of in-game obstacles that a player must overcome to advance within the game.  In-game obstacles can include
tasks, puzzles, opponents, levels, gates, actions, etc. In some games, a goal of the game may be to acquire certain in-game assets, which can then be used to complete in-game tasks or to overcome certain in-game obstacles.  For example, a player may be
able to acquire a virtual key (i.e., the in-game asset) that can then be used to open a virtual door (i.e., the in-game obstacle).
<br/><br/> An electronic social networking system typically operates with one or more social networking servers providing interaction between users such that a user can specify other users of the social networking system as "friends." A collection of users
and the "friend" connections between users can form a social graph that can be traversed to find second, third and more remote connections between users, much like a graph of nodes connected by edges can be traversed.
<br/><br/> Many online computer games are operated on an online social network.  Such a network allows both users and other parties to interact with the computer games directly, whether to play the games or to retrieve game- or user-related information. 
Internet users may maintain one or more accounts with various service providers, including, for example, online game networking systems and online social networking systems.  Online systems can typically be accessed using browser clients (e.g., Firefox,
Chrome, Internet Explorer).
<br/><br/> In many computer games, there are various types of in-game actions that a player character can make within the game.  For example, a player character in an online role-playing game may be able to interact with other player characters, build a
virtual house, attack enemies, go on a quest, go to a virtual store to buy/sell virtual items, etc. A player character in an online poker game may be able to play at specific tables, place bets of virtual currency for certain amounts, play or fold
certain hands, play in a online poker tournament, etc.
<br/><br/> Many of the functions performed during the game are visual in nature or have visual effects.  Animation, specifically, is often used to convey movement of characters and objects on the screen.  The animation involves moving objects on the
screen.  Music and sounds effects may also be played during the game. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/>Overview
<br/><br/> As described in the background section, online games can involve animation to move objects on a screen.  If this movement is repetitive (e.g., grass swaying, horses galloping, etc.) it necessarily has a certain pace to it.  At the same time,
music and/or sound effects may be playing.  In one example embodiment, music and/or sound effect (hereinafter referred to collectively as "audio") is synchronized with the animation in order to add to the emotional experience of a play session.
<br/><br/> The inventors of the present invention have determined that there are certain types of games where it is better to keep the audio unobtrusive, and use the dynamic range to punch moments of delight or excitement.  The inventors have also
recognized that brain activity of a user can be greatly affected by the tempos of audio being played.  In an example embodiment, this is extended to the animation as well.  By synchronizing both the audio and the animation and matching the rhythm of both
together (hereinafter referred to as "game rhythm") with the desired emotional state, the game can actually influence the user's emotions.  In some example embodiments, there may be an additive effect when combining both the audio and the animation in
this manner that affects user emotion much more than either would alone.
<br/><br/> Different brainwaves may become active depending upon what someone is feeling and experiencing.  Brain activity is typically measured by four brainwaves: Beta, Alpha, Theta, and Delta.  The four brainwaves can be measured in hertz, and therefore
can be converted to tempos.  As such, in one example embodiment, the desired brainwave in hertz is converted to a tempo and that tempo is used as a basis for the timing of both the audio and the animations.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, the system provides a unified dance between the animation, the user interface, and sound and music effects.  When they are unified it creates a game rhythm in the game that can be tuned to create emotions during play. 
In an example embodiment, three different rhythms are selected as possible game rhythms for the game.  The game rhythms can break apart different combinations of audio and animation rhythms that can be applied to different objects within the game.  These
rhythms can be communicated through audio (via the beats-per-minute, or BPM of the audio) and video (assuming a standard 30 frame per second display rate), the animation can be timed to work within that display rate while matching the audio rhythm.  The
three rhythms can be classified as placid, activated, and ecstatic.
<br/><br/> In placid mode, the user is calmly enjoying a creation in the game.  For example, if the game's objectives include gathering resources and building a farm, city, or other object using the resources, the placid mode may include the times the user
is simply looking at what has been created without actively building more or gathering more resources.  This mode may involve no interaction from the user, but alternatively may also include "passive" activity from the user, such as moving a cursor to an
object to look at the object in more detail, zooming in or out, etc. In such placid mode, the game rhythm may be set at 30 bpm, which equates to a 30 bpm audio rhythm and a 60 frame rhythm for the animation (once frame every 2 seconds at 30 fps).
<br/><br/> In activated mode, the user may be engaging in an "active" activity, such as gathering resources, building a structure or object, or otherwise engaging with objects to accomplish some goal.  In such activated mode, the game rhythm may be set at
between 60-120 bpm, which equates to a 60-120 bpm audio rhythm and a 15-30 frame rhythm for the animation (one frame every 0.5-1 seconds).
<br/><br/> In ecstatic mode, the user may have accomplished a significant game goal or is experience some other very exciting moment.  In such ecstatic mode, the game rhythm may be set at 120+ bpm, which equates to a 120+ bpm audio rhythm and a 15 or less
frame rhythm for the animation (one frame every 0.5 or less seconds).
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, the multiple game rhythms selected are exact multiples of one another.  This leads to a more aesthetically pleasing (both visually and aurally) transition between game rhythms.  Thus, for example, if placid mode is set
to 30 bpm, then activated mode may be set to 60 bpm, or 90 bpm, or 120 bpm, all multiples of 30 bpm.  If activated mode is set to 60 bpm, then activated mode may be set to 120 bpm, or 180 bpm, or 240 bpm, all multiples of 60 bpm.
<br/><br/> These and other example embodiments are described, by way of example, in further detail below.
<br/><br/> Example System
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a system for implementing various disclosed embodiments.  In particular embodiments, a system 100 comprises a user 102, a social networking system 108, a gaming platform 112, a client system 104, and a network
106.  The components of the system 100 can be connected to each other in any suitable configuration, using any suitable type of connection.  The components may be connected directly or over a network 106, which may be any suitable network.  For example,
one or more portions of network 106 may be an ad hoc network, an intranet, an extranet, a virtual private network (VPN), a local area network (LAN), a wireless LAN (WLAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless WAN (WWAN), a metropolitan area network
(MAN), a portion of the Internet, a portion of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), a cellular telephone network, another type of network, or a combination of two or more such networks.
<br/><br/> The social networking system 108 is a network-addressable computing system that can host one or more social graphs.  The social networking system 108 can generate, store, receive, and transmit social networking data.  The social network system
108 can be accessed by the other components of the system 100 either directly or via the network 106.  The gaming platform 112 is a network-addressable computing system that can host one or more online games.  The gaming platform 112 can generate, store,
receive, and transmit game-related data, such as, for example, game account data, game input, game state data, and game displays.  The gaming platform 112 can be accessed by the other components of the system 100 either directly or via the network 106. 
The user 102 may use the client system 104 to access, send data to, and receive data from the social networking system 108 and the gaming platform 112.  The client system 104 can access the social networking system 108 or the gaming platform 112
directly, via the network 106, or via a third-party system.  As an example and not by way of limitation, the client system 104 may access the gaming platform 112 via the social networking system 108.  The client system 104 can be any suitable computing
device, such as a touchscreen smartphone 104.1, tablet computer 104.2, cellular phone 104.3, personal computer 104.4, etc.
<br/><br/> Although FIG. 1 illustrates just one user 102, social network system 108, gaming platform 112, client system 104, and network 106, this disclosure contemplates any suitable number of users 102, social network systems 108, gaming platforms 112,
client systems 104, and networks 106.  As an example and not by way of limitation, the system 100 may include one or more gaming platforms 112 and no social networking systems 108.  As another example and not by way of limitation, the system 100 may
include a system that comprises both the social networking system 108 and the gaming platform 112.
<br/><br/> The components of the system 100 may be connected to each other using any suitable connections 110.  For example, the suitable connections 110 include wireline (such as, for example, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or Data Over Cable Service
Interface Specification (DOCSIS)), wireless (such as, for example, Wi-Fi or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)) or optical (such as, for example, Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) or Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH))
connections.  In particular embodiments, one or more connections 110 each include an ad hoc network, an intranet, an extranet, a VPN, a LAN, a WLAN, a WAN, a WWAN, a MAN, a portion of the Internet, a portion of the PSTN, a cellular telephone network, or
another type of connection, or a combination of two or more such connections.  The connections 110 need not necessarily be the same throughout the system 100.  One or more first connections 110 may differ in one or more respects from one or more second
connections 110.  Although FIG. 1 illustrates particular connections between the user 102, the social network system 108, the gaming platform 112, the client system 104, and the network 106, this disclosure contemplates any suitable connections between
the user 102, the social network system 108, the gaming platform 112, the client system 104, and the network 106.  As an example and not by way of limitation, in particular embodiments, the client system 104 may have a direct connection to social
networking system the 108 or gaming platform the 112, bypassing the network 106.
<br/><br/> Each client system 104 may take actions to load the game.  These actions may be prompted by user actions (e.g., user selecting a game to play).  Alternatively, these actions may be performed automatically (e.g., the user sets up the client
system 104 to automatically load the game each time the client system 104 is booted).  These actions may be referred to as load actions and the time it takes for these actions to complete may be referred to as load time.
<br/><br/> In one example, the load actions may comprise seven distinct steps, labeled T.sub.0 through T.sub.6.
<br/><br/> T.sub.0 involves the steps when the user's client software, such as a browser, loads an outer iframe (or index page).  This represents the first point of contact with the end user.  The user may only see a blank page at this point.
<br/><br/> T.sub.1 involves the steps when the user's client software loads an inner iframe, which in one example is a flash container.  At this point, the user may see tabs related to the game, a zbar (a toolbar showing game status and information), and a
white inner iframe.
<br/><br/> At T.sub.2, the flash container's iframe is Document Object Model (DOM) complete, namely it is completely rendered and javascript is executing.
<br/><br/> At T.sub.3, a preloader has been downloaded and is executing.  At this point the user sees preloader artwork with a progress bar at 0%.
<br/><br/> At T.sub.4, the main game file (perhaps in the form of an Shockwave Flash, or SWF file) has been loaded.  At this point, the progress bar may show somewhere in the middle of 0% and 100%, for example 50%.
<br/><br/> At T.sub.5, the user's game state has been loaded and a minimal number of assets have been.  The user at this point is allowed to begin interactivity, such as clicking on items on the game board.
<br/><br/> At T.sub.6, all assets that comprise the user's game board have been downloaded and rendered in the game.
<br/><br/> Online Games and Game Systems
<br/><br/> In an online computer game, a game engine manages the game state of the game.  Game state comprises all game play parameters, including player character state, non-player character (NPC) state, in-game object state, game world state (e.g.,
internal game clocks, game environment), and other game play parameters.  Each user 102 controls one or more player characters (PCs).  The game engine controls all other aspects of the game, including non-player characters (NPCs), and in-game objects. 
The game engine also manages game state, including player character state for currently active (online) and inactive (offline) players.
<br/><br/> An online game can be hosted by the gaming platform 112, which can be accessed using any suitable connection with a suitable client system 104.  A user 102 may have a game account on the gaming platform 112, wherein the game account can contain
a variety of information associated with the user (e.g., the player's personal information, financial information, purchase history, player character state, game state).  In some embodiments, a user may play multiple games on the gaming platform 112,
which may maintain a single game account for the user with respect to all the games, or multiple individual game accounts for each game with respect to the user.  In some embodiments, the gaming platform 112 can assign a unique identifier to each user
102 of an online game hosted on the gaming platform 112.  The gaming platform 112 can determine that a user 102 is accessing the online game by reading the user's cookies, which may be appended to HTTP requests transmitted by the client system 104,
and/or by the user 102 logging onto the online game.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the user 102 may access an online game and control the game's progress via the client system 104 (e.g., by inputting commands to the game at the client device).  Client system 104 can display the game interface,
receive inputs from the user 102, transmitting user inputs or other events to the game engine, and receive instructions from the game engine.  The game engine can be executed on any suitable system (such as, for example, the client system 104, the social
networking system 108, or the gaming platform 112).  As an example and not by way of limitation, the client system 104 can download client components of an online game, which are executed locally, while a remote game server, such as the gaming platform
112, provides backend support for the client components and may be responsible for maintaining application data of the game, processing the inputs from the user, updating and/or synchronizing the game state based on the game logic and each input from the
user, and transmitting instructions to the client system 104.  As another example and not by way of limitation, each time the user 102 provides an input to the game through the client system 104 (such as, for example, by typing on the keyboard or
clicking the mouse of the client system 104), the client components of the game may transmit the user's input to the gaming platform 112.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an example client system suitable for operating one or more example embodiments of the synchronized game rhythm aspect.  The client system may include at least a processor 200 and a memory 202.  The memory 202 may contain
information on appropriate bpm levels for corresponding emotional states of a user.  Additionally, an online game loading module 204 is provided to load an online game on the client system.  An emotional state module 206 is then configured to detect a
desired emotional state for the user based upon a game object selected by the user.  This process will be described in more detail later.  A game rhythm synchronizer 208 is configured to play game music for the online game at a bpm level from the memory
corresponding to a desired emotional state for the user as detected by the emotional state module, and to synchronize animation for one or more game objects within the electronic game with the selected bpm level.  This also is described in more detail
later.
<br/><br/> Optionally, one or more environmental sensors 210 may also be provided, allowing the emotional state module 206 to base its detection of a desired emotional state on information about the environment.  This process is also described in more
detail later.
<br/><br/> Synchronized Game Rhythm
<br/><br/> As described above, the rhythm of a game, including both audio and animation, can be synchronized so that these game elements appear to be working in tandem.  This may, in some embodiments, lead to a more unified feel for the online game for the
user.  In some embodiments, there may be multiple different game rhythms at various parts of the game.  In such embodiments, it may be beneficial to align the game rhythms so that they are multiples of one another.
<br/><br/> In other example embodiments, the game rhythms can vary for different game elements that are displayed simultaneously.  For example, background items in a game my animate at a one rhythm, whereas an item the user is interacting with (e.g.,
clicking and moving) will animate at another rhythm.  The audio, including sounds effects, associated with these game elements may also keep those same rhythms.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 3A-3P are diagrams illustrating an example of some shapes being animated in accordance with an example embodiment.  This embodiment generally follows the game object configuration described earlier, namely that some game objects are
classified as "placid," some as "activated," and some as "ecstatic", each advancing through frames at different rates.  The time differences between each of the figures depicted in FIGS. 3A-3P can be assumed to be half of a second (i.e., 0.5 seconds
elapses between FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B, and between FIGS. 3B and 3C.  It should be noted that the star cluster depicted under the "ecstatic" heading in each figure is described as advancing at a 16:1 signature.  For illustrative purposes, it will be assumed
that this is instead advancing at a 1:2 signature (i.e., every half of a second), otherwise the number of figures required to depict all of the frames advancing at a constant rate would be significantly larger.
<br/><br/> Referring first to FIG. 3A, it can be seen that each of the objects are depicted in a first state.  Specifically, the grass 300 is depicted as leaning slightly to the right, the horse 302 is depicted as standing erect but with a head leaning
forward, the mailbox 304 is depicted as standing straight up, the box 306 is depicted as high in the air, and the stars 308 depicted as a large number of stars, including some in a circle.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3B, after half a second progresses, the ecstatic group advances a frame.  As can be seen, the stars 308 are in a different configuration, here being reduced in number to three.  All of the other objects 300, 302, 304, and 306
remain unchanged.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3C, after another half of a second, the stars 308 are in yet another state.  Additionally, the box 306 has advanced to a second state, having fallen down from its previous position.  All of the other objects 300, 302, 304
remain unchanged.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3D, after another half of a second, the stars 308 revert back to their first state (here, the stars rotate through three different states --of course one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the loop can comprise
any number of states).  All of the other objects 300, 302, 304, 306 remain unchanged.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3E, after another half of a second, the stars 308 advance to their second state.  The box 306 advances to a third state, here being rotated clockwise slightly.  Additionally, the mailbox 304 advances to a second state,
beginning to lean slightly to the right.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3F, after another half of a second, the stars 308 advance to their second state.  All of the other objects 300, 302, 304, 306 remain unchanged.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3G, after another half of a second, the stars 308 advance to their third state.  The box 306 advances back to its first state, looping around every 3 states much like the stars 308 did.  All of the other objects 300, 302, 304
remain unchanged.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3H, after another half of a second, the stars 308 advance to their first state.  All of the other objects 300, 302, 304, 306 remain unchanged.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3I, after another half of a second, the stars 308 advance to their second state.  The box 306 advances to its second state.  The mailbox 304 advances to a third state, straightening up a little bit.  The horse 302 advances to a
second state 302, standing more erect.  The grass 300 remains unchanged.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3J, after another half of a second, the stars 308 advance to their third state.  All of the other objects 300, 302, 304, 306 remain unchanged.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3K, after another half of a second, the stars 308 advance to their first state.  The box 306 advances to its third state.  All of the other objects 300, 302, 304 remain unchanged.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3L, after another half of a second, the stars 308 advance to their second state.  All of the other objects 300, 302, 304, 306 remain unchanged.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3M, after another half of a second, the stars 308 advance to their third state.  The box 306 advances to its first state.  The mailbox 304 advances to a first state looping as the box 306 and stars 308 did.  All of the other
objects 300, 302 remain unchanged.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3N, after another half of a second, the stars 308 advance to their first state.  All of the other objects 300, 302, 304, 306 remain unchanged.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3O, after another half of a second, the stars 308 advance to their second state.  The box 306 advances to its second state.  All of the other objects 300, 302, 304 remain unchanged.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3P, after another half of a second, the stars 308 advance to their third state.  All of the other objects 300, 302, 304, 306 remain unchanged.
<br/><br/> Of course, while only 16 "advances" are depicted, the process may continue indefinitely.  At a next state, the grass 300 may begin to sway while the other objects 302-308 continue their progression as depicted.  For sake of brevity, these
additional advances will not be depicted.
<br/><br/> As can be seen by these figures, however, the movements have been synchronized to occur at the same time or at multiples of the same interval.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, the particular bpm levels corresponding to different emotional states can vary depending on the user.  For example, the "placid" bpm level can be different for one user than another user.  This variance can depend on a
number of different factors, including a user's unique personality.  For example, some users may be "type A" personalities who benefit more from higher bpm levels than "type B" personalities.  The variance can also depend on the individual mood of the
user.  A user in a good mood may be assigned a particular bpm level for "placid" whereas a user in a bad mood may be assigned a different bpm level.
<br/><br/> In addition to varying the bpm level between users, the bpm levels within a category can also vary for a particular user depending on various factors.  As described above, mood may influence the desired bpm level.  Furthermore, time of day,
temperature, or other outside influences can also influence the desired bpm level.  Another example is the user's physical or psychological state.  The game may be used to help regulate the user's state.  For example, if the user is exercising while
playing the game, the game may attempt to set a bpm appropriate for exercise.  This bpm may even be personalized based on various health factors (age, weight, etc.).  A psychological state for the user could also be detected, allowing the game to help
influence the state.  For example, if the user is sad, the game may attempt to adjust the bpm levels upwards to help improve the mood of the user.  Likewise, if the user is stressed, the game may attempt to adjust the bpm levels downwards to calm the
user down.  As such, an environmental sensor (or sensors) may be utilized to detect these outside influences.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for synchronizing game rhythm in accordance with an example embodiment.  At 400, a desired emotional state is identified for a user playing an electronic game.  This may be performed in a number of
different ways.  In one example embodiment, the game object that the user selects will determine the desired emotional state.  Particular game objects may be associated with particular emotional states.  At 402, a bpm level corresponding to the desired
emotional state is selected.  At 404, game music for the electronic game is played at the selected bpm level.  At 406, animation for one or more game objects within the electronic game is synchronized with the selected bpm level.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for synchronizing game rhythm in accordance with another example embodiment.  At 500, game objects within an electronic game are classified into categories.  For example, operation 500 may classify
the game objects into three categories, including placid, activated, and ecstatic.  At 502, upon selection of a game object by a user playing the electronic game, game music for the electronic game and animation for the selected game object are
synchronized to a bpm level corresponding to a desired emotional state matching the category of the selected game object.
<br/><br/> As described above, in placid mode, the user is calmly enjoying a creation in the game.  For example, if the game's objectives include gathering resources and building a farm, city, or other object using the resources, the placid mode may
include the times the user is simply looking at what has been created without actively building more or gathering more resources.  This mode may involve no interaction from the user, but alternatively may also include "passive" activity from the user,
such as moving a cursor to an object to look at the object in more detail, zooming in or out, etc. In such placid mode, the game rhythm may be set at 30 bpm, which equates to a 30 bpm audio rhythm and a 60 frame rhythm for the animation (once frame every
2 seconds at 30 fps).
<br/><br/> In activated mode, the user may be engaging in an "active" activity, such as gathering resources, building a structure or object, or otherwise engaging with objects to accomplish some goal.  In such activated mode, the game rhythm may be set at
between 60-120 bpm, which equates to a 60-120 bpm audio rhythm and a 15-30 frame rhythm for the animation (one frame every 0.5-1 seconds).
<br/><br/> In ecstatic mode, the user may have accomplished a significant game goal or is experience some other very exciting moment.  In such ecstatic mode, the game rhythm may be set at 120+ bpm, which equates to a 120+ bpm audio rhythm and a 15 or less
frame rhythm for the animation (one frame every 0.5 or less seconds).
<br/><br/> Game Systems, Social Networks, and Social Graphs:
<br/><br/> In an online multiplayer game, players may control player characters (PCs), a game engine controls non-player characters (NPCs) and game features, and the game engine also manages player character state and game state and tracks the state for
currently active (i.e., online) players and currently inactive (i.e., offline) players.  A player character can have a set of attributes and a set of friends associated with the player character.  As used herein, the term "player character state" can
refer to any in-game characteristic of a player character, such as location, assets, levels, condition, health, status, inventory, skill set, name, orientation, affiliation, specialty, and so on.  Player characters may be displayed as graphical avatars
within a user interface of the game.  In other implementations, no avatar or other graphical representation of the player character is displayed.  Game state encompasses the notion of player character state and refers to any parameter value that
characterizes the state of an in-game element, such as a non-player character, a virtual object (such as a wall or castle), etc. The game engine may use player character state to determine the outcome of game events, sometimes also considering set or
random variables.  Generally, a player character's probability of having a more favorable outcome is greater when the player character has a better state.  For example, a healthier player character is less likely to die in a particular encounter relative
to a weaker player character or non-player character.  In some embodiments, the game engine can assign a unique client identifier to each user.
<br/><br/> Referring back to FIG. 1, in particular embodiments, the user 102 may access particular game instances of an online game.  A game instance is copy of a specific game play area that is created during runtime.  In particular embodiments, a game
instance is a discrete game play area where one or more users 102 can interact in synchronous or asynchronous play.  A game instance may be, for example, a level, zone, area, region, location, virtual space, or other suitable play area.  A game instance
may be populated by one or more in-game objects.  Each object may be defined within the game instance by one or more variables, such as, for example, position, height, width, depth, direction, time, duration, speed, color, and other suitable variables. 
A game instance may be exclusive (i.e., accessible by specific users) or non-exclusive (i.e., accessible by any user).  In particular embodiments, a game instance is populated by one or more player characters controlled by one or more users 102 and one
or more in-game objects controlled by the game engine.  When accessing an online game, the game engine may allow the user 102 to select a particular game instance to play from a plurality of game instances.  Alternatively, the game engine may
automatically select the game instance that the user 102 will access.  In particular embodiments, an online game comprises only one game instance that all users 102 of the online game can access.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a specific game instance may be associated with one or more specific users.  A game instance is associated with a specific user when one or more game parameters of the game instance are associated with the specific
user.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a game instance associated with a first user may be named "First User's Play Area." This game instance may be populated with the first user's PC and one or more in-game objects associated with the first
user.  In particular embodiments, a game instance associated with a specific user may only be accessible by that specific user.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a first user may access a first game instance when playing an online game, and
this first game instance may be inaccessible to all other users.  In other embodiments, a game instance associated with a specific user may be accessible by one or more other users, either synchronously or asynchronously with the specific user's game
play.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a first user may be associated with a first game instance, but the first game instance may be accessed by all first-degree friends in the first user's social network.  In particular embodiments, the game
engine may create a specific game instance for a specific user when that user accesses the game.  As an example and not by way of limitation, the game engine may create a first game instance when a first user initially accesses an online game, and that
same game instance may be loaded each time the first user accesses the game.  As another example and not by way of limitation, the game engine may create a new game instance each time a first user accesses an online game, wherein each game instance may
be created randomly or selected from a set of predetermined game instances.  In particular embodiments, the set of in-game actions available to a specific user may be different in a game instance that is associated with that user compared to a game
instance that is not associated with that user.  The set of in-game actions available to a specific user in a game instance associated with that user may be a subset, superset, or independent of the set of in-game actions available to that user in a game
instance that is not associated with him.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a first user may be associated with Blackacre Farm in an online farming game.  The first user may be able to plant crops on Blackacre Farm.  If the first user accesses
game instance associated with another user, such as Whiteacre Farm, the game engine may not allow the first user to plant crops in that game instance.  However, other in-game actions may be available to the first player, such as watering or fertilizing
crops on Whiteacre Farm.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a game engine can interface with a social graph.  Social graphs are models of connections between entities (e.g., individuals, users, contacts, friends, players, player characters, non-player characters, businesses,
groups, associations, concepts, etc.).  These entities are considered "users" of the social graph; as such, the terms "entity" and "user" may be used interchangeably when referring to social graphs herein.  A social graph can have a node for each entity
and edges to represent relationships between entities.  A node in a social graph can represent any entity.  In particular embodiments, a unique client identifier can be assigned to each user in the social graph.  This disclosure assumes that at least one
entity of a social graph is a player or player character in an online multiplayer game, though this disclosure any suitable social graph users.
<br/><br/> The minimum number of edges required to connect a player (or player character) to another user is considered the degree of separation between them.  For example, where the player and the user are directly connected (one edge), they are deemed to
be separated by one degree of separation.  The user would be a so-called "first-degree friend" of the player.  Where the player and the user are connected through one other user (two edges), they are deemed to be separated by two degrees of separation. 
This user would be a so-called "second-degree friend" of the player.  Where the player and the user are connected through N edges (or N-1 other users), they are deemed to be separated by N degrees of separation.  This user would be a so-called
"Nth-degree friend." As used herein, the term "friend" means only first-degree friends, unless context suggests otherwise.
<br/><br/> Within the social graph, each player (or player character) has a social network.  A player's social network includes all users in the social graph within N.sub.max degrees of the player, where N.sub.max is the maximum degree of separation
allowed by the system managing the social graph (such as, for example, the social networking system 108 or the gaming platform 112).  In one embodiment, N.sub.max equals 1, such that the player's social network includes only first-degree friends.  In
another embodiment, N.sub.max is unlimited and the player's social network is coextensive with the social graph.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the social graph is managed by the gaming platform 112, which is managed by the game operator.  In other embodiments, the social graph is part of a social networking system 108 managed by a third-party (e.g., <b><i>Facebook,</i></b>
Friendster, Myspace).  In yet other embodiments, the player 102 has a social network on both the gaming platform 112 and the social networking system 108, wherein the player 102 can have a social network on the gaming platform 112 that is a subset,
superset, or independent of the player's social network on the social networking system 108.  In such combined systems, the gaming platform 112 can maintain social graph information with edge type attributes that indicate whether a given friend is an
"in-game friend," an "out-of-game friend," or both.  The various embodiments disclosed herein are operable when the social graph is managed by the social networking system 108, the gaming platform 112, or both.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 shows an example of a social network within a social graph.  As shown, The user 621 can be associated, connected or linked to various other users, or "friends," within the social network 650.  These associations, connections or links can
track relationships between users within the social network 650 and are commonly referred to as online "friends" or "friendships" between users.  Each friend or friendship in a particular user's social network within a social graph is commonly referred
to as a "node." For purposes of illustration and not by way of limitation, the details of the social network 650 will be described in relation to the user 202.  As used herein, the terms "player" and "user" can be used interchangeably and can refer to
any user or character in an online multiuser game system or social networking system.  As used herein, the term "friend" can mean any node within a player's social network.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 6, The user 602 has direct connections with several friends.  When the user 621 has a direct connection with another individual, that connection is referred to as a first-degree friend.  In social network 650, the user 602 has
two first-degree friends.  That is, the user 602 is directly connected to Friend 1.sub.1 611 and Friend 2.sub.1 621.  In a social graph, it is possible for individuals to be connected to other individuals through their first-degree friends (i.e., friends
of friends).  As described above, each edge required to connect a user to another user is considered the degree of separation.  For example, FIG. 6 shows that the user 602 has three second-degree friends to which he is connected via his connection to his
first-degree friends.  Second-degree Friend 1.sub.2 612 and Friend 2.sub.2 622 are connected to the user 602 via his first-degree Friend 1.sub.1 611.  The limit on the depth of friend connections, or the number of degrees of separation for associations,
that the user 602 is allowed is typically dictated by the restrictions and policies implemented by the social networking system 108.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, the user 602 can have Nth-degree friends connected to him through a chain of intermediary degree friends as indicated in FIG. 6.  For example, Nth-degree Friend 1.sub.N 619 is connected to the user 602 via second-degree
Friend 3.sub.2 632 and one or more other higher-degree friends.  Various embodiments may take advantage of and utilize the distinction between the various degrees of friendship relative to Player 602.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a user (or player character) can have a social graph within an online multiplayer game that is maintained by the game engine and another social graph maintained by a separate social networking system.  FIG. 6 depicts
an example of in-game social network 606 and out-of-game social network 650.  In this example, the user 602 has out-of-game connections 655 to a plurality of friends, forming an out-of-game social network 650.  Here, Friend 1.sub.1 611 and Friend 2.sub.1
621 are first-degree friends with the user 602 in his out-of-game social network 650.  The user 601 also has in-game connections 665 to a plurality of players, forming an in-game social network 606.  Here, Friend 2.sub.1 621, Friend 3.sub.1 631, and
Friend 4.sub.1 641 are first-degree friends with the user 602 in his in-game social network 660.  In some embodiments, it is possible for a friend to be in both the out-of-game social network 650 and the in-game social network 660.  Here, Friend 2.sub.1
621 has both an out-of-game connection 655 and an in-game connection 665 with Player 602, such that Friend 2.sub.1 621 is in both the user 601's in-game social network 606 and the user 602's out-of-game social network 650.
<br/><br/> As with other social networks, the user 602 can have second-degree and higher-degree friends in both his in-game and out of game social networks.  In some embodiments, it is possible for the user 602 to have a friend connected to him both in his
in-game and out-of-game social networks, wherein the friend is at different degrees of separation in each network.  For example, if Friend 2.sub.2 622 had a direct in-game connection with the user 602, Friend 2.sub.2 622 would be a second-degree friend
in the user 602's out-of-game social network, but a first-degree friend in the user 602's in-game social network.  In particular embodiments, a game engine can access the in-game social network 606, the out-of-game social network 650, or both.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the connections in a user's in-game social network can be formed both explicitly (e.g., users must "friend" each other) and implicitly (e.g., system observes user behaviors and "friends" users to each other).  Unless
otherwise indicated, reference to a friend connection between two or more users can be interpreted to cover both explicit and implicit connections, using one or more social graphs and other factors to infer friend connections.  The friend connections can
be unidirectional or bidirectional.  It is also not a limitation of this description that two players who are deemed "friends" for the purposes of this disclosure are not friends in real life (i.e., in disintermediated interactions or the like), but that
could be the case.
<br/><br/> Data Flow
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 illustrates an example data flow between example components of an example system 700.  One or more of the components of the example system 700 may correspond to one or more of the components of the example gaming environment 100.  In some
embodiments, the system 700 includes a client system 730, a social networking system 720a, and a gaming platform 720b.  The components of the system 700 can be connected to each other in any suitable configuration, using any suitable type of connection. 
The components may be connected directly or over any suitable network.  The client system 730, the social networking system 720a, and the gaming platform 720b may have one or more corresponding data stores such as the local data store 725, the social
data store 745, and the game data store 765, respectively.
<br/><br/> The client system 730 may receive and transmit data 723 to and from the gaming platform 720b.  This data can include, for example, a web page, a message, a game input, a game display, a HTTP packet, a data request, transaction information, and
other suitable data.  At some other time, or at the same time, the gaming platform 720b may communicate data 743, 746 (e.g., game state information, game system account information, page info, messages, data requests, updates) with other networking
systems, such as the social networking system 720a (e.g., <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Myspace).  The client system 730 can also receive and transmit data 726 to and from the social networking system 720a.  This data can include, for example, web pages, messages, social
graph information, social network displays, HTTP packets, data requests, transaction information, updates, and other suitable data.
<br/><br/> Communication between the client system 730, the social networking system 720a, and the gaming platform 720b can occur over any appropriate electronic communication medium or network using any suitable communications protocols.  For example, the
client system 730, as well as various servers of the systems described herein, may include Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networking stacks to provide for datagram and transport functions.  Of course, any other suitable network and
transport layer protocols can be utilized.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, an instance of a virtual game is stored as a set of game state parameters that characterize the state of various in-game objects, such as, for example, player character state parameters, non-player character parameters, and
virtual item parameters.  In some embodiments, game state is maintained in a database as a serialized, unstructured string of text data as a so-called Binary Large Object (BLOB).  When a user accesses a virtual game on the gaming platform 720b, the BLOB
containing the game state for the instance corresponding to the user may be transmitted to the client system 730 for use by a client-side executed object to process.  In some embodiments, the client-side executable is a FLASH-based game, which can
de-serialize the game state data in the BLOB.  As a user plays the game, the game logic implemented at the client system 730 maintains and modifies the various game state parameters locally.  The client-side game logic may also batch game events, such as
mouse clicks, and transmit these events to the gaming platform 720b.  Gaming platform 720b may itself operate by retrieving a copy of the BLOB from a database or an intermediate memory cache (memcache) layer.  The gaming platform 720b can also
de-serialize the BLOB to resolve the game state parameters and execute its own game logic based on the events in the batch file of events transmitted by the client to synchronize the game state on the server side.  The gaming platform 720b may then
re-serialize the game state, now modified into a BLOB, and pass this to a memory cache layer for lazy updates to a persistent database.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a computer-implemented game is a text-based or turn-based game implemented as a series of web pages that are generated after a user selects one or more actions to perform.  The web pages may be displayed in a browser client
executed on the client system 730.  For example, a client application downloaded to the client system 730 may operate to serve a set of web pages to a user.  As another example, a virtual game may be an animated or rendered game executable as a
stand-alone application or within the context of a webpage or other structured document.  In some embodiments, the virtual game is implemented using Adobe Flash-based technologies.  As an example, a game may be fully or partially implemented as a SWF
object that is embedded in a web page and executable by a Flash media user plug-in. In some embodiments, one or more described web pages is associated with or accessed by the social networking system 720a.  This disclosure contemplates using any suitable
application for the retrieval and rendering of structured documents hosted by any suitable network-addressable resource or website.
<br/><br/> Application event data of a game is any data relevant to the game (e.g., user inputs).  In some embodiments, each application datum may have a name and a value, and the value of the application datum may change (e.g., be updated) at any time. 
When an update to an application datum occurs at the client system 730, either caused by an action of a game user or by the game logic itself, the client system 730 may need to inform the gaming platform 720b of the update.  For example, if the game is a
farming game with a harvest mechanic (such as Zynga FarmVille), an event can correspond to a user clicking on a parcel of land to harvest a crop.  In such an instance, the application event data may identify an event or action (e.g., harvest) and an
object in the game to which the event or action applies.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, one or more objects of a game are represented as Adobe Flash objects.  Flash may manipulate vector and raster graphics, and supports bidirectional streaming of audio and video.  "Flash" may mean the authoring environment,
the user, or the application files.  In some embodiments, the client system 730 may include a Flash client.  The Flash client may be configured to receive and run Flash application or game object code from any suitable networking system (such as, for
example, the social networking system 720a or the gaming platform 720b).  In some embodiments, the Flash client is run in a browser client executed on the client system 730.  A user can interact with Flash objects using the client system 730 and the
Flash client.  The Flash objects can represent a variety of in-game objects.  Thus, the user may perform various in-game actions on various in-game objects by making various changes and updates to the associated Flash objects.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, in-game actions are initiated by clicking or similarly interacting with a Flash object that represents a particular in-game object.  For example, a user can interact with a Flash object to use, move, rotate, delete, attack,
shoot, or harvest an in-game object.  This disclosure contemplates performing any suitable in-game action by interacting with any suitable Flash object.  In some embodiments, when the user makes a change to a Flash object representing an in-game object,
the client-executed game logic may update one or more game state parameters associated with the in-game object.  To ensure synchronization between the Flash object shown to the user at the client system 730, the Flash client may send the events that
caused the game state changes to the in-game object to the gaming platform 720b.  However, to expedite the processing and hence the speed of the overall gaming experience, the Flash client may collect a batch of some number of events or updates into a
batch file.  The number of events or updates may be determined by the Flash client dynamically or determined by the gaming platform 720b based on server loads or other factors.  For example, client system 730 may send a batch file to the gaming platform
720b whenever 50 updates have been collected or after a threshold period of time, such as every minute.
<br/><br/> As used herein, the term "application event data" may refer to any data relevant to a computer-implemented virtual game application that may affect one or more game state parameters, including, for example and without limitation, changes to user
data or metadata, changes to user social connections or contacts, user inputs to the game, and events generated by the game logic.  In some embodiments, each application datum has a name and a value.  The value of an application datum may change at any
time in response to the game play of a user or in response to the game engine (e.g., based on the game logic).  In some embodiments, an application data update occurs when the value of a specific application datum is changed.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, when a user plays a virtual game on the client system 730, the gaming platform 720b serializes all the game-related data, including, for example and without limitation, game states, game events, user inputs, for this
particular user and this particular game into a BLOB and may store the BLOB in a database.  The BLOB may be associated with an identifier that indicates that the BLOB contains the serialized game-related data for a particular user and a particular
virtual game.  In some embodiments, while a user is not playing the virtual game, the corresponding BLOB may be stored in the database.  This enables a user to stop playing the game at any time without losing the current state of the game the user is in.
When a user resumes playing the game next time, gaming platform 720b may retrieve the corresponding BLOB from the database to determine the most-recent values of the game-related data.  In some embodiments, while a user is playing the virtual game, the
gaming platform 720b also loads the corresponding BLOB into a memory cache so that the game system may have faster access to the BLOB and the game-related data contained therein.
<br/><br/> Various embodiments may operate in a wide area network environment, such as the Internet, including multiple network addressable systems.  FIG. 8 illustrates an example network environment 800, in which various example embodiments may operate. 
Network cloud 860 generally represents one or more interconnected networks, over which the systems and hosts described herein can communicate.  The network cloud 860 may include packet-based wide area networks (such as the Internet), private networks,
wireless networks, satellite networks, cellular networks, paging networks, and the like.  As FIG. 8 illustrates, various embodiments may operate in a network environment 800 comprising one or more networking systems, such as a social networking system
820a, a gaming platform 820b, and one or more client systems 830.  The components of the social networking system 820a and the gaming platform 820b operate analogously; as such, hereinafter they may be referred to simply as the networking system 820. 
The client systems 830 are operably connected to the network environment 800 via a network service provider, a wireless carrier, or any other suitable means.
<br/><br/> The networking system 820 is a network addressable system that, in various example embodiments, comprises one or more physical servers 822 and data stores 824.  The one or more physical servers 822 are operably connected to the computer network
cloud 860 via, by way of example, a set of routers and/or networking switches 826.  In an example embodiment, the functionality hosted by the one or more physical servers 822 may include web or HTTP servers, FTP servers, as well as, without limitation,
webpages and applications implemented using Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script, PHP Hyper-text Preprocessor (PHP), Active Server Pages (ASP), Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Java, JavaScript, Asynchronous
JavaScript and XML (AJAX), Flash, ActionScript, and the like.
<br/><br/> The physical servers 822 may host functionality directed to the operations of the networking system 820.  Hereinafter, the servers 822 may be referred to as server 822, although the server 822 may include numerous servers hosting, for example,
the networking system 820, as well as other content distribution servers, data stores, and databases.  The data store 824 may store content and data relating to, and enabling, operation of, the networking system 820 as digital data objects.  A data
object, in some embodiments, is an item of digital information typically stored or embodied in a data file, database, or record.  Content objects may take many forms, including: text (e.g., ASCII, SGML, HTML), images (e.g., jpeg, tif and gif), graphics
(vector-based or bitmap), audio, video (e.g., mpeg), or other multimedia, and combinations thereof.  Content object data may also include executable code objects (e.g., games executable within a browser window or frame), podcasts, etc.
<br/><br/> Logically, the data store 824 corresponds to one or more of a variety of separate and integrated databases, such as relational databases and object-oriented databases that maintain information as an integrated collection of logically related
records or files stored on one or more physical systems.  Structurally, the data store 824 may generally include one or more of a large class of data storage and management systems.  In some embodiments, the data store 824 may be implemented by any
suitable physical system(s) including components, such as one or more database servers, mass storage media, media library systems, storage area networks, data storage clouds, and the like.  In one example embodiment, the data store 824 includes one or
more servers, databases (e.g., MySQL), and/or data warehouses.  The data store 824 may include data associated with different networking system 820 users and/or client systems 830.
<br/><br/> The client system 830 is generally a computer or computing device including functionality for communicating (e.g., remotely) over a computer network.  The client system 930 may be a desktop computer, laptop computer, personal digital assistant
(PDA), in- or out-of-car navigation system, smart phone or other cellular or mobile phone, or mobile gaming device, among other suitable computing devices.  The client system 830 may execute one or more client applications, such as a Web browser.
<br/><br/> When a user at the client system 830 desires to view a particular webpage (hereinafter also referred to as target structured document) hosted by the networking system 820, the user's web browser, or other document rendering engine or suitable
client application, formulates and transmits a request to the networking system 820.  The request generally includes a URL or other document identifier as well as metadata or other information.  By way of example, the request may include information
identifying the user, a timestamp identifying when the request was transmitted, and/or location information identifying a geographic location of the user's client system 830 or a logical network location of the user's client system 830.
<br/><br/> Although the example network environment 800 described above and illustrated in FIG. 8 is described with respect to the social networking system 820a and the gaming platform 820b, this disclosure encompasses any suitable network environment
using any suitable systems.  For example, a network environment may include online media systems, online reviewing systems, online search engines, online advertising systems, or any combination of two or more such systems.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 illustrates an example computing system architecture, which may be used to implement a server 922 or a client system 930.  In one embodiment, the hardware system 900 comprises a processor 902, a cache memory 904, and one or more
executable modules and drivers, stored on a tangible computer-readable storage medium, directed to the functions described herein.  Additionally, the hardware system 900 may include a high performance input/output (I/O) bus 906 and a standard I/O bus
908.  A host bridge 910 may couple the processor 902 to the high performance I/O bus 906, whereas the I/O bus bridge 912 couples the two buses 906 and 908 to each other.  A system memory 914 and one or more network/communication interfaces 916 may couple
to the bus 906.  The hardware system 900 may further include video memory (not shown) and a display device coupled to the video memory.  Mass storage 918 and I/O ports 920 may couple to the bus 908.  The hardware system 900 may optionally include a
keyboard, a pointing device, and a display device (not shown) coupled to the bus 908.  Collectively, these elements are intended to represent a broad category of computer hardware systems.
<br/><br/> The elements of the hardware system 900 are described in greater detail below.  In particular, the network interface 916 provides communication between the hardware system 900 and any of a wide range of networks, such as an Ethernet (e.g., IEEE
802.3) network, a backplane, etc. The mass storage 918 provides permanent storage for the data and programming instructions to perform the above-described functions implemented in servers 922 of FIG. 9, whereas system memory 914 (e.g., DRAM) provides
temporary storage for the data and programming instructions when executed by the processor 902.  I/O ports 920 are one or more serial and/or parallel communication ports that provide communication between additional peripheral devices, which may be
coupled to the hardware system 900.
<br/><br/> The hardware system 900 may include a variety of system architectures and various components of the hardware system 900 may be rearranged.  For example, cache memory 904 may be on-chip with the processor 902.  Alternatively, the cache memory 904
and the processor 902 may be packed together as a "processor module," with processor 902 being referred to as the "processor core." Furthermore, certain embodiments of the present disclosure may neither require nor include all of the above components. 
For example, the peripheral devices shown coupled to the standard I/O bus 908 may couple to the high performance I/O bus 906.  In addition, in some embodiments, only a single bus may exist, with the components of the hardware system 900 being coupled to
the single bus.  Furthermore, the hardware system 900 may include additional components, such as additional processors, storage devices, or memories.
<br/><br/> An operating system manages and controls the operation of the hardware system 900, including the input and output of data to and from software applications (not shown).  The operating system provides an interface between the software
applications being executed on the system and the hardware components of the system.  Any suitable operating system may be used.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the above-described elements and operations may comprise instructions that are stored on non-transitory storage media.  The instructions can be retrieved and executed by a processing system.  Some examples of instructions are
software, program code, and firmware.  Some examples of non-transitory storage media are memory devices, tape, disks, integrated circuits, and servers.  The instructions may be executed by the processing system to direct the processing system to operate
in accord with the disclosure.  The term "processing system" refers to a single processing device or a group of inter-operational processing devices.  Some examples of processing devices are integrated circuits and logic circuitry.  Those skilled in the
art are familiar with instructions, computers, and storage media.
<br/><br/> One or more features from any embodiment may be combined with one or more features of any other embodiment without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
<br/><br/> A recitation of "a", "an," or "the" is intended to mean "one or more" unless specifically indicated to the contrary.  In addition, it is to be understood that functional operations, such as "awarding", "locating", "permitting" and the like, are
executed by game application logic that accesses, and/or causes changes to, various data attribute values maintained in a database or other memory.
<br/><br/> The present disclosure encompasses all changes, substitutions, variations, alterations, and modifications to the example embodiments herein that a person having ordinary skill in the art would comprehend.  Similarly, where appropriate, the
appended claims encompass all changes, substitutions, variations, alterations, and modifications to the example embodiments herein that a person having ordinary skill in the art would comprehend.
<br/><br/> For example, the methods, game features and game mechanics described herein may be implemented using hardware components, software components, and/or any combination thereof.  By way of example, while embodiments of the present disclosure have
been described as operating in connection with a networking website, various embodiments of the present disclosure can be used in connection with any communications facility that supports web applications.  Furthermore, in some embodiments the term "web
service" and "website" may be used interchangeably and additionally may refer to a custom or generalized API on a device, such as a mobile device (e.g., cellular phone, smart phone, personal GPS, personal digital assistance, personal gaming device,
etc.), that makes API calls directly to a server.  Still further, while the embodiments described above operate with business-related virtual objects (such as stores and restaurants), the embodiments can be applied to any in-game asset around which a
harvest mechanic is implemented, such as a virtual stove, a plot of land, and the like.  The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.  It will, however, be evident that various
modifications and changes may be made thereunto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the disclosure as set forth in the claims and that the disclosure is intended to cover all modifications and equivalents within the scope of the
following claims.
