       <font size="+1">Measuring the effects of social sharing on online content and advertising
</font><br/>
       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A computer-implemented method, advertising network, and computer readable
     medium for measuring ad performance metrics after user-initiated sharing
     activity at a website. The method commences by receiving an original
     internet ad, the original internet ad for hosting within a website (e.g.
     a social networking website), then recoding the original internet ad
     (also for hosting within a website) wherein the recoded sharable internet
     ad comprises ad sharing and instrumentation code for capturing, tracking
     and later reporting various user-initiated sharing activities by
     measuring online events using the ad sharing and instrumentation code
     (i.e. the online events being in response to user-initiated sharing
     activity) without requiring any explicit action to be provided by the
     website operator. In some cases, the measured event occurs in the form of
     expanding an ad, clicking a request to share, printing a coupon, or
     performing an online conversion action. The ad can comprise any forms of
     internet media.

<br/><br/> The present invention is directed towards online advertising, and more particularly toward a methodology to track the effects of sharing on content and advertising within online social networks.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The exploding popularity and sophistication of the internet has brought to bear easy access for anyone or any entity to publish, consume and aggregate content.  Along with an explosion of content, the rate of appearance of advertisements that
accompany content (which advertisements also serve to monetize the content) is growing at a similar pace.  Internet advertising supports a large and sophisticated ecosystem of participants including publishers, content providers, ad networks, ad
agencies, ad aggregators, ad arbitragers, and social networking website operators.
<br/><br/> Some of the participants are more technologically savvy than others, and understand the inner workings of an ad network.  In contrast, some of the participants have more marketing savvy than others, but do not necessarily understand the inner
workings of ad placement.  Highly effective internet advertising demands high performance from the network as well as high performance (e.g. high performance in the form of clicks or conversions) from the population to which the advertisement is
targeted.  However, in some situations, especially in the context of online social networking websites, the effectiveness of advertisements cannot be comprehended solely on the basis of legacy measurement techniques.
<br/><br/> For this and other reasons, what is needed are techniques for measuring the effects of social sharing on online content and advertising.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> In the context of online social networking websites, the effectiveness of advertisements can be measured for subsequent analysis based on capturing aspects of events resulting from user-initiated sharing activity at an internet website. 
User-initiated forms of "social sharing" can include any form of online viral marketing.  In many cases, social sharing promotes content, which content can include video, news, product information, etc, even including social sharing of advertisements. 
Indeed, many marketers have started to incorporate sharing capabilities into their advertising campaigns and, similarly many online publishers promote social sharing by offering sharing tools within or alongside content on their website (e.g. an internet
destination site, a social networking site, etc).
<br/><br/> For both marketers and publishers alike, the challenge has been to figure out how to measure the effectiveness of sharing and ad.  Specifically, both marketers and publishers want to measure the effect of user-initiated sharing activity (e.g.
pre-sharing activity, actual user sharing of the ad, and post-sharing activity).  Most social networks that enable sharing offer and promote application program interfaces (APIs) that allow third parties to share content or share advertising, possibly
including sharing along with user comments or other user connotation messages (e.g. a thumbs-up, a thumbs-down, like, dislike, etc).  However, these legacy APIs, regardless of sophistication, provide little or no means of tracking the effectiveness of
this sharing.  That is, such legacy APIs do not possess capabilities to track the full range of user-initiated activities.  Without such a tracking capability, marketers and publishers are left in the dark as to the value that can be attributed to each
sharing and any post-sharing activity.
<br/><br/> Embodiments herein provide an easily deployable tracking and measurement capability (i.e. a tracking capability that instruments sharing behavior without requiring any explicit action or explicit data sharing, or explicit API capability, or
other explicit support to be provided by the operator of the website),
<br/><br/> The techniques herein describe methodologies and techniques to track the effects of sharing on content and advertising using an online social network website (or any other website for that matter).  In some situations, application of the
techniques described herein can be used for measuring the effects of pre-sharing activities and of post-sharing activities, possibly for use in optimizing an advertising campaign.
<br/><br/> The disclosure herein includes descriptions of methods as well as descriptions of apparatuses included in a networked system for online advertising.  Some embodiments incorporate the social sharing component (e.g. a screen device, a widget, etc)
within the authoring/publishing tools.  Such authoring/publishing tools can be designed in a way that when a sharing component is included into an advertisement or into a publisher's page (e.g. at a publisher's website, or at a social networking
website), the sharing component automatically instruments sharing behavior--without requiring any explicit action or explicit data sharing, or explicit API capability, or other explicit support to be provided by the operator of the website.  In various
embodiments, a sharing component automatically instruments pre-sharing activity as well as post-sharing activity.  In some embodiments, a sharing component may automatically instrument sharing activity itself.
<br/><br/> A method for automatically instrument sharing activity commences by receiving an original internet ad, the original internet ad for hosting within a social networking website, then recoding the original internet ad (also for hosting within a
social networking website) wherein the recoded sharable internet ad comprises ad sharing and instrumentation code for capturing, tracking and later reporting user-initiated sharing activities by measuring online events using the ad sharing and
instrumentation code (i.e. the online events being in response to user-initiated sharing activity)--and without requiring any explicit action to be provided by the operator of the website.  In some cases, the measured event occurs in the form of
expanding an ad, clicking a request to share, printing a coupon, or performing an online conversion action.  The ad can comprises any of a video clip, a video clip with audio, and/or a video clip with user controls, etc. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE

<br/><br/> Overview of Online Social Network Websites in Online Advertising
<br/><br/> Use of online social networking has become a very common component of an internet user's online activity.  Accordingly, measurement of various aspects of a user's behavior within the context of online social networking activities has become
important to measuring the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns.  Advertisers have long recognized that highly effective advertising campaigns often exhibit "pop culture" or "word of mouth" or other "social sharing" behaviors in advance of an ad
or product "catching on" or "going viral".
<br/><br/> In the context of online advertising, "social sharing" can include any form of online viral marketing.  In many cases, social sharing promotes content, which content can include video, news, product information, etc, even including social
sharing of advertisements.  Indeed, many marketers have started to incorporate sharing capabilities into their advertising campaigns and, similarly many online publishers promote social sharing by offering sharing tools within or alongside content on
their website (e.g. an internet destination site, a social networking site, etc).
<br/><br/> For both marketers and publishers alike, the challenge has been to figure out how to measure the effectiveness of sharing an ad.  Specifically, both marketers and publishers want to measure the effect of user-initiated sharing activity (e.g.
pre-sharing activity, actual user sharing of the ad, and post-sharing activity).  Most social networks that enable sharing offer and promote application program interfaces (APIs) that allow third parties to share content or share advertising, possibly
including sharing along with user comments or other user connotation messages (e.g. a thumbs-up, a thumbs-down, like, dislike, etc).
<br/><br/> However, these legacy APIs, regardless of sophistication, provide little or no means of tracking the effectiveness of this sharing.  That is, such legacy APIs do not possess capabilities to track activities that occur post-sharing.  Without a
post-sharing tracking and measurement capability, the marketers and publishers are left in the dark as to the value that can be attributed to each sharing and any post-sharing activity.  As a result, publishers and marketers cannot decide what types of
content are most suitable for sharing, particularly as relating to the effectiveness of an advertisement to garner clicks and/or conversions.  Nor can they determine which social networks provide the best value for advertising.  Nor can they determine
which users are the significant influencers within the viral path.  This lack of measurement capability and any insight that derives from measurements related thereto makes it difficult for the marketers and publishers to optimize an advertising campaign
that relies (wholly or in part) on social sharing activity.
<br/><br/> The techniques herein describe methodologies and techniques to track the effects of sharing on content and advertising using an online social network website (or any other website for that matter).  In some situations, application of the
techniques described herein can be used for measuring the effects of pre-sharing activities and of post-sharing activities, possibly for use in optimizing an advertising campaign.
<br/><br/> The disclosure herein includes descriptions of methods as well as descriptions of apparatuses included in a networked system for online advertising.  Some embodiments incorporate the social sharing component (e.g. a screen device, a widget, etc)
within the authoring/publishing tools.  Such authoring/publishing tools can be designed in a way that when a sharing component is included into an advertisement or into a publisher's page (e.g. at a publisher's website, or at a social networking
website), the sharing component automatically instruments sharing behavior--without requiring any explicit action or explicit data sharing, or explicit API capability, or other explicit support to be provided by the operator of the website.  In various
embodiments, a sharing component automatically instruments pre-sharing activity as well as post-sharing activity.  In some embodiments, a sharing component may automatically instrument sharing activity itself.
<br/><br/> Overview of Networked Systems for Online Advertising
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 depicts an advertising server network including modules for measuring the effects of social sharing on online content and advertising.
<br/><br/> In the context of internet advertising, placement of advertisements within an internet environment (e.g. online advertising system 100 of FIG. 1) has become common.  As shown, network nodes are organized into a network such than an internet
advertiser or agent may select a particular property (e.g. a website, a social networking website) and may create an advertisement such that whenever any internet user, via a client system 116, renders the web page from the selected property, possibly
using a social networking server 120, and/or a publisher's website server 106, the advertisement is composited on the web page by one or more servers (e.g. the aforementioned servers and/or an ad network server 125) for delivery to a client system 116
over a network 130.  Given this generalized delivery model, and using techniques disclosed herein, sophisticated online advertising might be practiced.  Moreover the online advertising system 100 serves various needs of the participants in the internet
ad ecosystem, including booking of contracts for internet advertising campaigns, measurement of social sharing of online advertising, and for management of a wide range of aspects of prosecuting such an internet advertising campaign.
<br/><br/> Again referring to FIG. 1, an internet property (e.g. a social networkingwebsite 122 embodied in a social networking server 120) might be able to attract internet visitors, which visitors may have any arbitrary interest, demographic, target
predicates, or other attributes.  In fact, a social networking server 120, possibly in conjunction with a data gathering and statistics module 112, can capture details as pertains to user behavior.  Thus, an internet user's behaviors, demographics and
interests might be `known` in quite some detail as pertains to a wide range of user queries, interest categories, or other demographics or attributes.  Also, behaviors (e.g. the likelihood of a click or other measurable online event) might also be known
in quite some detail, not only for a particular user, but also for a group of users corresponding to a particular slice of the available data.  Such characteristics (i.e. one or more characteristics) and/or features can be used in the statistical
modeling of users, even to the extent that a forecasting module 111, possibly in conjunction with a data gathering and statistics module 112, can forecast future supply accurately--or at least to a statistically known degree of accuracy.  Thus, for a
particular user, ads corresponding to the demographics of the particular user may be served as advertisements retrieved from an ad network server 125.  In some situations, reaching a particular demographic is commercially competitive, so multiple
advertisements retrieved from an ad network server 125, possibly in conjunction with a social networking server 120, may be auctioned (possibly using bidding at an auction server 107), which can be used to resolve such commercial competition.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the online advertising system 100 might host a variety of modules to serve management and control operations (e.g. an objective optimization module 110, a forecasting module 111, a data gathering and statistics module 112,
an advertisement serving module 113, an automated bidding management module 114, an admission control and pricing module 115, etc) pertinent to defining and managing ad campaigns and for serving advertisements to users.  In particular, the modules,
network links, algorithms, serving policies, and data structures embodied within the online advertising system 100 might be specialized so as to perform a particular function or group of functions reliably while observing capacity and performance
requirements.  For example, an admission control and pricing module 115 might serve for storing an original internet ad 150 in readiness for processing before the start of a corresponding campaign.  As a further example, an ad instrumentation module 119,
a sharing activity processing module 117, and/or a sharing activity reporting module 118 can operate partly in an offline (or batch) mode, and partly in a real-time (or interactive) online mode.  As shown, and without regard to allocation of any
particular operation to any particular mode, an ad instrumentation module 119 can accept an original internet ad 150 and recode it into one or more forms for producing a recoded sharable internet ad 160 using ad sharing and instrumentation code 170.  Any
one or more modules within an online advertising system 100 can operate cooperatively to implement a system for measuring the effects of social sharing on online content and advertising.  Furthermore, an online event 180 can occur anywhere in the online
advertising system 100, and actual measurement of an online event 180 may be carried out in any module (e.g. within the social networking server 120, within the social networking website 122, within the sharing activity processing module 117, etc).
<br/><br/> As earlier indicated, sharing activities can include pre-sharing activities, the sharing activity itself, and post-sharing activities.  In an exemplary embodiment involving rich media advertising authoring, a sharing component automatically
instruments pre-sharing activity, the sharing activity itself, and automatically instruments post-sharing activity as well.  These activated are shown and described in the figures and accompanying text below.
<br/><br/> Measurement of Sharing-related Activity
<br/><br/> Some embodiments incorporate sharing as a component within the ad authoring to make incorporating sharing (e.g. using a sharing component) as easy as selecting from a drop-down menu choice in the ad authoring tool.  Such an ad authoring tool may
be included in an overall campaign definition and management tool.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2A depicts a screen device 2A00 with a multi-step procedure for defining and managing variables within an advertising campaign.  As shown, the steps for defining variables within an ad campaign might include providing some initial
information about the products or services to be advertised 2A10, establishing geographic coverage 2A20, defining keywords and bid phrases 2A30, defining advertising spend- and budget-oriented constraints 2A40, creating advertising copy and advertising
imagery 2A50, and activating and/or saving the campaign 2A60 variables.  In various embodiments, one or more of the steps 2A10-2A60 might be performed on the basis of user interaction from a client system 116 (see FIG. 1).  In other embodiments, one or
more of the steps 2A10-2A60 might be performed either fully automatically, or in a computer-aided manner by use of a content server.  In an exemplary embodiment, the step providing some initial information about the products or services to be advertised
2A10 might include a screen device 2A15 for requesting a user to merely identify a web page that features the products or services to be advertised.  Of course a wide range of information about the subject product or service might be retrieved from the
identified web page(s), including information on geographic location, appropriate geographic scope, keywords, images and style for creative advertisement generation, and even budget-related constraints or variables.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2B depicts a screen device 2B00 for a campaign variable set-up procedure for selecting media objects.  As shown, a view portal, namely rich media view portal 2B10 might be populated manually (e.g. via drag-and-drop) or other screen device,
or it might be populated either fully automatically or in a computer-aided manner, possibly using data gathered from use of the screen devices of FIG. 2A.  In particular, any media objects selected may be used in further operations, for example in
operations for adding instrumentation pertinent to measuring the effects of social sharing on online content and advertising (discussed below).  Further, an authoring tool might include an object viewer or multiple object viewers 2B20 and a control panel
(not shown in FIG. 2B).
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 depicts a screen device for adding instrumentation pertinent to measuring the effects of social sharing on online content and advertising.  Using such an object cockpit 300, an advertiser can incorporate the social sharing instrumentation
component (e.g. using ad sharing and instrumentation code 170) while using the authoring/publishing tools.  As shown, the object cockpit 300 is designed in a way that ad sharing and instrumentation code 170 can be automatically incorporated into an
advertisement at the election of the advertiser (i.e. at the election by the user of the authoring/publishing tools).
<br/><br/> Continuing the description of FIG. 3, the object cockpit 300 includes an object viewer 310, which includes a static object display viewport 312 and a live object display viewport 314.  The live object display can include video and audio played
in real time.  In some cases the first frame of a video advertisement is the first frame of the video clip.  In other cases the first frame of a video advertisement is a key frame (which may or may not be included in the remainder of the video clip). 
Also shown is a control panel 320, which includes display tabs 322 and a plurality of buttons 324 with or without pull-down menus.
<br/><br/> Now, having an ad campaign (whether defined using the aforementioned tools or any other method), it can be comprehended that various tools can be augmented so as to facilitate composition of an advertisement (see FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B), including
user-directed facilities for adding instrumentation pertinent to measuring the effects of social sharing on online content and advertising (see FIG. 3).
<br/><br/> For measuring the effects of social sharing on online content and advertising, various embodiments of the object cockpit 300 provide screen devices (e.g. buttons, pull-down menus, text fields, checkboxes, etc).  More particularly, the object
cockpit 300 includes screen devices for including ad sharing and instrumentation code 170 into the ad or into the publisher's web page; thus, the ad sharing and instrumentation code automatically instruments the sharing behavior to track both pre-sharing
activities as well as the post-sharing activities.
<br/><br/> In exemplary embodiments, the ad sharing and instrumentation code, when incorporated into an ad or page, serves to: 1.  Measure sharing by each element in the ad.  2.  Track the total number of measured sharing activities.  3.  Track activities
with specific characteristics to facilitate reporting of a categorization of sharing activity by social network.  For example, the ad sharing and instrumentation code can measure how many users shared the ads from a particular social networking website
or application (e.g. by using Yahoo!, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, email, etc).  Such measurements can then be used to determine which social networks or applications appeal most to users and/or what ordering of social networking icons returns the most desired
results, etc. 4.  Measure drop of rate along each step in the sharing process.  Such measurements might serve to streamline the process of sharing.  For example, if sharing at a specific network requires a user to explicitly logon into the network, this
may discourage users from sharing and the sharing activity may significantly drop.  This data might serve to provide feedback for the publisher and the social network to allow the sharing of common user credentials.  Or, such feedback might serve to
reduce or eliminate reliance on a common set of users between the publisher and the social network.
<br/><br/> The object cockpit 300 includes screen devices for including ad sharing and instrumentation code 170 into the ad or into the publisher's page.  In particular, the object cockpit 300 includes a social-share tagging device 330.  As shown, the
social-share tagging device 330 supports user selection of one or more combinations of characteristics of the ad sharing and instrumentation code for instrumenting the sharing behavior for tracking both pre-sharing activities as well as post-sharing
activities.  Post-sharing activity includes user behavior during or after the advertisement has been displayed, for example, during or after a user visits a social networking website.  As an example, the advertisement can be displayed within a social
networking site page.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4A depicts a social networking web page 4A00 showing a plurality of regions for constituent components of a social networking web page.  As shown, the social networking web page 4A00 comprises a branding region 4A02, possibly for display of
a branding logo or message; a top ad space 4A03, possibly for display of a banner ad; a lead story headline space 4A04; and an interactive screen device 4A05.  Also depicted is a video messaging area 4A06, caption area(s) 4A07, share device area(s) 4A08,
and an ad plus coupon area 4A09.  The ad plus coupon area 4A09 includes an an-in-ad area 4A10.  Of course any ad may contain an ad-in-ad area and, recursively, any ad-in-ad area may contain a further ad-in-ad area.  Moreover, a particular ad may be
sponsored or placed by an agent or aggregator, and such an ad might involve one or more sub-advertisers.  For example, an ad placed by an aggregator (e.g. the chamber of commerce of Anytown, USA) might promote tourism by offering suggestions of locations
for fine dining.  The aggregator might then follow some promotion rules and place, within the aggregator's tourism ad, further ads in the form of an ad-in-ad area.  In such an example, the ad-in-ad materials might be provided by the advertiser or by the
advertiser's agency (e.g. on an advertisement serving module 113), or by any other party in the internet ad ecosystem for that matter.
<br/><br/> Thus, it becomes apparent that the display of a social networking web page might involve multiple network calls in succession in order to retrieve all components for composition and display on the user's client system display device. 
Furthermore, any ad (e.g. a top ad space 4A03, and/or an ad-in-ad area 4A10) might contain one or more instances of ad sharing and instrumentation code 170.  As shown, the top ad space 4A03 contains an instance of ad sharing 170.sub.1, and the ad plus
coupon area 4A09 also contains an instance of ad sharing 170.sub.2.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4B depicts a social networking web page showing an enlargement of an area for a share device area.  As shown, the social networking web page 4A00 contains a share device area 4A08.  Within a share device area 4A08, one or more share icons
4B12 can be displayed.  For example, the share device area 4A08.sub.2 can contain a Yahoo! website share icon 4B12.sub.0, a Twitter website share icon 4B12.sub.1, a <b><i>Facebook</i></b> website share icon 4B12.sub.2, and/or any other sharing website icon 4B12.sub.3,
etc.
<br/><br/> Now, as earlier indicated, a module within an online advertising system 100 (e.g. a sharing activity processing module 117 within an online advertising system) can track activities with specific characteristics to facilitate reporting of a
categorization of sharing activity by the social network.  As can now be understood, the presence and activation of ad sharing and instrumentation code 170 within an ad (e.g. within or associated with a share device area 4A08) can capture the online
event of a user sharing an ad (e.g. by using a share icon 4B12).  Thus, after capturing measurements resulting from the user sharing activity (e.g. using a sharing activity processing module 117) a sharing activity reporting module 118 within an online
advertising system can report a categorization of sharing activity by the social network or networks selected by the user.  These measurements can then be used to determine which social networks appeal most to which users, what ordering of social
networking icons works the best, etc. In addition, capturing measurements resulting from the user sharing activity during post-sharing activities can also be measured and reported.
<br/><br/> Measurement of Post-Sharing Activity
<br/><br/> In the context of sharing within (or between) social networking websites, examples of measurements of post-sharing activities include, without limitation, measurements of any online events that occur after a particular ad has been shared.  From
such measurements, specific marketing information can be provided to the advertiser or advertiser's agent such as: 1.  Measuring sharers: An important aspect to be gleaned from social sharing is to measure which users are typically more likely to share. 
This can be done by capturing demographic information in the user's bcookie/lcookie, thus allowing the publisher and ad network to recognize users within certain demographics, and to then value these users higher when presenting them with sharing
options.  2.  Measuring influencers in the sharing path: By capturing demographic information from the user's bcookie or lcookie (possibly using a URL encoded crumb) the sharing activity processing module 117 can measure how much of the post-click
activity each user (and subsequently their friends and friend's friends, and so on) generates.  At least since the shared ad (e.g. a recoded sharable internet ad 160) comprises ad sharing and instrumentation code 170, this measurement does not require
explicit data sharing or explicit support from the social networks.  Thus, using this technique in combination with other techniques disclosed herein allows measuring influencers in the sharing path, irrespective of the social network.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a click beacon may be provided, the beacon including the user-specific crumb in it.  This crumb can be anonymized to remove any personally identifiable information, and otherwise address any privacy concerns.  Thus, using
these techniques, the disclosed methods and systems for measuring the effects of social sharing on online content and advertising serves for: 1.  Measurement of sharing activity for both advertisements and content.  2.  Providing sharing activity reports
to advertisers and publishers in order to determine which sharing networks to include in an ad/page by measuring which sharing networks their users use the most.  3.  Providing sharing activity reports to advertisers, publishers, and advertising network
providers to measure the post-click activity, including determination of which social networks generate the most post-click activity.  4.  Measurement of effectiveness sharing of each element within the ad/page.  5.  Providing sharing activity reports to
advertiser networks and publisher networks to determine sharers and influencers on their respective networks.
<br/><br/> Some embodiments support sharing of a coupon, which coupon may be incorporated into a sharable ad.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5A depicts an ad plus coupon sharing area within a social networking web page.  The sharing area 5A00 includes an invitation for the user to logon 5A02 into one or more social networking websites (e.g. <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> as shown).
<br/><br/> FIG. 5B depicts an ad plus coupon sharing area for user annotation.  The sharing area 5B00 includes an area (e.g. a text box, as shown) for the user to add a comment to the shared coupon.  The user can add such an annotation, and then decide to
publish (see the "Publish" button 5B02) or skip (see the "Skip" button 5B04) the annotation option.
<br/><br/> As can be understood from the foregoing discussions of sharing options, a single action of sharing may result in further cascaded acts of sharing.  To facilitate a cascade of sharing, various screen devices may be employed.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6A depicts a sharable ad plus a shared comment provided by an earlier sharer (e.g. as is depicted in FIG. 5B and described in the corresponding description).  As shown, the sharable ad plus a comment provided by an earlier sharer 6A00 may
include a rich media ad area 6A10, a first element of shared content 6A20, and a second element of shared content 6A30.  The user activity (e.g. clicking sharing) may be captured as pertaining to any element (e.g. a click on a first element of shared
content 6A20 and/or a click on a second element of shared content 6A30).  The contents of a rich media ad area 6A10 can include a video clip, a video clip with audio, a video clip with user controls, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6B depicts a display area 6B00 with a cascaded sharing area 6B10.  As shown, the display area 6B00 may include a rich media ad area 6A10, a first element of shared content 6A20, and a second element of shared content 6A30.  The cascaded
sharing area 6B10 includes suggestions for further sharing.  For example, the cascaded sharing area 6B10 can include suggestions of names of users with whom to share.
<br/><br/> Thus, using the techniques described herein (e.g. beacons, crumbs, etc), the extent of the cascade of sharing can be measured.  Conversely, application of techniques described herein can also measure drop rates along each step in the sharing
process.  Such measurements of drop rates can facilitate improvements to the process of sharing.  For example, if sharing to a specific network requires a user to explicitly logon into that network, then this may discourage that user from sharing and the
subsequent sharing activity may drop significantly.
<br/><br/> Additional Detailed Measurement of Sharing Activity
<br/><br/> Some embodiments track clicks on each element of the shared content/ad separately via the use of a post-sharing click redirect mechanism.  Many additional tracking mechanisms are possible and envisioned.  For example, Table 1 shows several
possibilities of tracking activities (e.g. using a tracking beacon) arranged into classification buckets.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 Classification Buckets Classification Bucket # Description 1 Video and coupon but no sharing (Control Bucket) 2 Video sharing only 3 Coupon sharing only 4 Video and coupon sharing 5 Coupon sharing but no video

<br/><br/> Post-Sharing Metrics
<br/><br/> Click-backs on each of the shared elements
<br/><br/> Inline video plays and completions
<br/><br/> Clicks on coupons
<br/><br/> Coupon print activity (e.g. conversion tracking)
<br/><br/> Use of GUID
<br/><br/> As indicated above, a tracking beacon for capturing pre-sharing and post-sharing activities can carry an impression object (e.g. a data structure) populated with user and activity information, including a time stamp.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 depicts an impression object for capturing pre-sharing and post-sharing activities.  As shown, an impression object 700 can comprise fields for storing a global user identification (GUID), a source indicator, an asset identifier, a time
stamp, and an action code.  An impression object 700 as may be populated with one or more of the aforementioned fields, and a sharing activity processing module 117, and/or a sharing activity reporting module 118, may use any one or more of the populated
fields for gathering and reporting information regarding pre- and post-sharing activities.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, using such an impression object, possibly in combination with a beacon as earlier described, it is possible to measure and track activities.  Moreover, such a technique does not rely on the API of the social networking website, thus
offering flexibility for large-scale, rapid deployment.
<br/><br/> As further examples of activities to be measured (e.g. online events), Table 2 presents measured online events and descriptions of same.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 Measured Online Events Online Event Name Description Expand_Ad User initiated expand of an advertisement; also captures rich media screen device interaction (e.g. clicks, hover over, etc) Share_Click Captures attributes of
the element the user wants to share Share_Networks Captures which sharing network(s) the user clicks on (i.e. which share icons) Share_Peaks Captures the drop-off rate after local peaks Print_Coupon Captures a print coupon action Conversion_Action
Captures use of a coupon in a commercial transaction
<br/><br/> Some of the aforementioned techniques can be applied in a network-independent manner.  Additionally, a particular social network can provide intra-network facilities that augment common, network-independent capabilities.  Strictly as an
exemplary set, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> provides online events specific to various shared items (e.g. a page title, an image, a link, a video title, etc), and such online events can be carried in an impression object.  Table 3 presents such measured online events and
descriptions of same.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00003 TABLE 3 Intra-Network Actions Online Event Name Description Title_Click Click on a title of an intra-network shared coupon Img_Click Image thumbnail click on an intra-network shared coupon Link_Click Link click on an intra-network
shared coupon Video_Click Click on an intra-network shared video Video_Interact Inline video interaction (e.g. game play, re-play, etc)
<br/><br/> It can be understood that the aforementioned techniques can be applied to advantageously perform operations for measuring the effects of social sharing on online content and advertising.  Further, in one embodiment, a computer-implemented method
for measuring ad performance metrics after user-initiated sharing activity at a social networking website can commence upon receiving an original internet ad (i.e. the original internet ad for hosting within a social networking website), followed by
recoding the original internet ad in order to produce a recoded sharable internet ad (which recoded sharable internet ad may use any of a range of heretofore disclosed screen devices).  The recoded internet ad comprises ad sharing and instrumentation
code for measuring any of a wide range of online events.  More particularly, for measuring the effects of social sharing on online content and advertising, any of the range of online events are in response to the user-initiated sharing activity--or in
response to a second user-initiated activity and so on in a cascade of events triggering other events.
<br/><br/> Again, for measuring the effects of social sharing on online content and advertising, any one or more modules (e.g. sharing activity reporting module 118) can serve for reporting a categorization of sharing activity.  In fact, the online events
and any categorization of sharing activity can include results of tracking an expand_ad event, a share_click event, a share_networks event, a print_coupon event, and/or a conversion_action event (see Table 2).  Indeed user-initiated sharing activity may
be stimulated by effective, eye-catching advertisements, possibly including ads comprising a video clip, a video clip with audio, a video clip with user controls, etc. In some cases an advertisement may include a coupon, and the coupon (as well as any
other portion of the ad) may be shared.  For ease of adoption (e.g. by advertisers), tools can be provided and possibly integrated into pre-existing publisher/advertiser tools.  In some cases a tool includes an object cockpit, and the recoding of the ad
(for sharing) is performed using an object cockpit for computer-aided incorporation of the instrumentation code into the original internet ad.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 depicts a block diagram of a system for measuring ad performance metrics after user-initiated sharing activity at a social networking website.  As an option, the present system 800 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and
functionality of the embodiments described herein.  Of course, however, the system 800 or any operation therein may be carried out in any desired environment.  As shown, system 800 includes a plurality of modules, each connected to a communication link
805, and any module can communicate with other modules over communication link 805.  The modules of the system can, individually or in combination, perform method steps within system 800.  Any method steps performed within system 800 may be performed in
any order unless as may be specified in the claims.  As shown, system 800 implements a method for measuring ad performance metrics after user-initiated sharing activity at a social networking website, the system 800 comprising modules for: receiving, in
memory, an original internet ad, the original internet ad for hosting within a social networking website (see module 810); recoding, in a computer, the original internet ad for producing a recoded sharable internet ad, the recoded sharable internet ad
comprising ad sharing and instrumentation code (see module 820); and measuring, in a computer, an online event using the ad sharing and instrumentation code, the online event being in response to the user-initiated sharing activity (see module 830).
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a diagrammatic representation of a network 900, including nodes for client computer systems 902.sub.1 through 902.sub.N, nodes for server computer systems 904.sub.1 through 904.sub.N, and nodes for network infrastructure 906.sub.1
through 906.sub.N, any of which nodes may comprise a machine (e.g. computer 950) within which a set of instructions for causing the machine to perform any one of the techniques discussed above may be executed.  The embodiment shown is purely exemplary,
and might be implemented in the context of one or more of the figures herein.
<br/><br/> Any node of the network 900 may comprise a general-purpose processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other programmable logic device, a discrete gate
or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof capable to perform the functions described herein.  A general-purpose processor may be a microprocessor, but in the alternative, the processor may be any conventional
processor, controller, microcontroller, or state machine.  A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices (e.g. a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in
conjunction with a DSP core, or any other such configuration, etc).
<br/><br/> In alternative embodiments, a node may comprise a machine in the form of a virtual machine (VM), a virtual server, a virtual client, a virtual desktop, a virtual volume, a network router, a network switch, a network bridge, a personal digital
assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a web appliance, or any machine capable of executing a sequence of instructions that specify actions to be taken by that machine.  Any node of the network may communicate cooperatively with another node on the
network.  In some embodiments, any node of the network may communicate cooperatively with every other node of the network.  Further, any node or group of nodes on the network may comprise one or more computer systems (e.g. a client computer system, a
server computer system) and/or may comprise one or more embedded computer systems, a massively parallel computer system, and/or a cloud computer system.
<br/><br/> The computer system (e.g. computer 950) includes a processor 908 (e.g. a processor core, a microprocessor, a computing device, etc), a main memory (e.g. computer memory 910), and a static memory 912, which communicate with each other via a bus
914.  The computer 950 may further include a display unit (e.g. computer display 916) that may comprise a touch-screen, or a liquid crystal display (LCD), or a light emitting diode (LED) display, or a cathode ray tube (CRT).  As shown, the computer
system also includes a human input/output (I/O) device 918 (e.g. a keyboard, an alphanumeric keypad, etc), a pointing device 920 (e.g. a mouse, a touch screen, etc), a drive unit 922 (e.g. a disk drive unit, a CD/DVD drive, a tangible computer readable
removable media drive, an SSD storage device, etc), a signal generation device 928 (e.g. a speaker, an audio output, etc), and a network interface device 930 (e.g. an Ethernet interface, a wired network interface, a wireless network interface, a
propagated signal interface, etc).  The drive unit 922 includes a machine-readable medium 924 on which is stored a set of instructions (i.e. software, firmware, middleware, etc) 926 embodying any one, or all, of the methodologies described above.  The
set of instructions 926 is also shown to reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory and/or within the processor 908.  The set of instructions 926 may further be transmitted or received via the network interface device 930 over the
network bus 914.
<br/><br/> It is to be understood that embodiments of this invention may be used as, or to support, a set of instructions executed upon some form of processing core (such as the CPU of a computer) or otherwise implemented or realized upon or within a
machine- or computer-readable medium.  A machine-readable medium includes any mechanism for storing or transmitting non-transitory information in a form readable by a machine (e.g. a computer).  For example, a machine-readable medium includes read-only
memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); magnetic disk storage media; optical storage media; flash memory devices; and electrical, optical or acoustical or any other type of media suitable for storing non-transitory information.
<br/><br/> While the invention has been described with reference to numerous specific details, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the invention can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the invention. 
Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the invention is not to be limited by the foregoing illustrative details, but rather is to be defined by the appended claims.
