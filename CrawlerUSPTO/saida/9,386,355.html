       <br/><br/> This application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application
     Ser. No. 13/601,927, "Generating Alerts For Live Performances," filed on
     Aug. 31, 2012, published as US-2014-0062696-A1 on Mar. 06, 2014 and
     issued as US 8,842,007 on Sep. 23, 2014, by Packard, et al., incorporated
     herein by reference in its entirety.
         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method for generating alerts for a live performance, comprising: monitoring a live performance to identify one or more events of interest and derive real-time measured
attributes;  generating different sets of excitement levels based on the real-time measured attributes for the identified one or more events of interest in the live performance, the different sets of excitement levels relate to different subscriber
categories;  for each of the different sets of excitement levels, identifying if any of the excitement levels are at or above one or more excitement thresholds;  generating different sets of alerts for the different subscriber categories with respect to
the excitement levels that are at or above one or more excitement thresholds;  and reporting alerts for the identified one or more events of interest that are above one or more excitement thresholds to a plurality of subscribers.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1 wherein generating the different sets of alerts further comprises: determining an amount of time required to trigger the different sets of alerts for the excitement levels that are at the one or more excitement
thresholds;  and wherein reporting the alerts that are above the one or more excitement thresholds to the plurality of subscribers further comprises reporting the alerts to the plurality of subscribers when the amount of time required to trigger the
different sets of alerts reaches a pre-determined value.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1 wherein generating the different sets of alerts further comprises instantaneously triggering the different sets of alerts based on the identified one or more events of interest in the live performance.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 3, wherein the identified one or more events of interest comprises identifying a nail-biter event in the live performance.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 3 wherein generating the different sets of alerts further comprises instantaneously triggering the different sets of alerts when an excitement level is at or above one or more of the excitement thresholds and an amount of
time remaining in the live performance is less than a threshold value.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 1 comprising reporting the different sets of alerts to the plurality of subscribers based on an alert level related the plurality of subscribers.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 6 wherein the alert level relates to the number of alerts that a subscriber wishes to receive during the live performance and when the subscriber wishes to be notified of the alerts.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 1, wherein reporting the different sets of alerts comprises generating an excitement alert for a home team fan, an excitement alert for a visiting team fan and an excitement alert for a neutral team fan related to the
live performance.
<br/><br/> 9.  A method for generating alerts for a live performance, comprising: receiving different sets of excitement levels for a live performance;  analyzing an input data stream comprising real-time updates related to the live performance and
deriving performance attributes related to the input data stream;  for each of the different sets of excitement levels, identifying if any of the excitement levels are at or above one or more excitement thresholds;  determining an amount of time required
to trigger the different sets of alerts for the excitement levels that are at the one or more excitement thresholds;  determining whether the excitement levels have been at the one or more thresholds for the determined amount of time required to trigger,
for the excitement levels that are at the one or more excitement thresholds;  and generating and reporting alerts to a plurality of subscribers for those excitement levels based on the performance attributes and that have been determined to be at the one
or more thresholds for the determined amount of time required to trigger.
<br/><br/> 10.  The method of claim 9, further comprising: instantaneously triggering the different sets of alerts based on identifying one or more events of interest in the live performance.
<br/><br/> 11.  The method of claim 9, wherein: reporting the alerts comprises reporting a first alert for a home team fan, a second and different alert for a visiting team fan and a third and different alert for a neutral fan related to the live
performance.
<br/><br/> 12.  One or more processor readable storage devices having processor readable code embodied on the processor readable storage devices, the processor readable code for programming one or more processors to perform a method comprising: monitoring
a live performance;  generating different sets of excitement levels for the live performance based on the monitoring, the different sets of excitement levels relate to different subscriber categories;  for each of the different sets of excitement levels,
identifying if any of the excitement levels are at or above one or more excitement thresholds;  determining an amount of time required to trigger different sets of alerts for the excitement levels that are at the one or more excitement thresholds;  and
reporting the different sets of alerts to the plurality of subscribers when the amount of time required to trigger the different sets of alerts reaches a pre-determined value, the set of alerts configurable to preserve suspense of a time shifted display
of the live performance.
<br/><br/> 13.  The one or more processor readable storage devices of claim 12, wherein generating the different sets of alerts further comprises: computing the remaining time required to trigger the different sets of alerts based on the difference between
the amount of time and a rate;  and triggering the different sets of alerts when the difference between the amount of time and a rate reaches the pre-determined value.
<br/><br/> 14.  The method of claim 1, wherein the measured attributes are measured performance attributes representing qualified aspects of one or more characteristics of the live performance that quantitatively impact the excitement of the live
performance.
<br/><br/> 15.  The method of claim 9, further comprising: identifying events of interest in the live performance for the analyzing, and wherein the performance attributes are for different subscriber categories such that first set of excitement levels is
generated for a first category of subscribers and a second set of excitement levels is generated for a second category of subscribers.

<br/><br/> There are many services that provide game highlights, box scores, and performance commentary for sporting events.  However, these services generally spoil the excitement of any recorded sports performances by revealing the score, statistics, and
highlights of what transpired.  A fan seeking to watch highlights of a game that he or she missed or a fan reminded of a game that is being or was missed is typically informed of the outcome of the performance, causing the fan to miss out on the
excitement of experiencing the buildup of game's events as they unfold.
<br/><br/> Additionally, with the amount of performances available over the Internet and time-shifted to a DVR, sports fans can spend precious hours viewing a boring game or one that simply turns out as expected.  Furthermore, what may be an exciting event
for one sports fan may be uneventful to another sports fan.  Currently available services merely broadcast a game's highlights without considering the myriad preferences of the game's audience that make the game more exciting or less exciting for
individual fans.  This results in the inefficient use of the sports fans' time, a potential decrease in advertisement revenue, and the loss of viewership and does not allow a fan to experience all the thrill of the game as it unfolds in front of them.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The technology disclosed herein relates to generating excitement ratings.  alerts and teasers for live performances.  As used herein, a live performance refers to any live action or content that has an element of uncertainty, suspense, surprise
or competitiveness associated with it.  The disclosed technology directs sports (or other types of) fans and enthusiasts to the best live performances being played, while preserving the emotional thrill of watching the live performance play out. 
Individuals are alerted to the most exciting live performances being played and when to start watching them.  Based on this information, individuals can tune into the live performance and jump right into the action, whether on their television, mobile
device, computer, or at the live venue.
<br/><br/> In order to preserve the suspense of events that fans may not be able to watch live, the disclosed technology can indicate only the excitement level of a match, without revealing the score or other spoilers, if the fan so desires.  Individuals
or fans who elect to time shift their viewing have confidence that the live performance they are watching is going to be truly exciting without knowing anything else about the live performance, thus allowing them to experience the thrill of the live
performance as it unfolds in front of them.
<br/><br/> In one set of embodiments, the disclosed technology generates different excitement levels for live performances based on factors that might make a live performance more exciting or less exciting for different categories of subscribers and/or by
analyzing live feeds of play-by-play statistics related to the live performances.  In one embodiment, the different categories of subscribers relate to fans of a particular type of performance, team, league, player, division, conference, game, sport,
genre or other variable.  In one example, the different categories of subscribers include home team fans, visiting team fans and neutral fans.  As used herein, a home team fan refers to a subscriber who is a fan of (or otherwise has an affinity for) the
team that hosts the live performance, the visiting team fan refers to a subscriber who is a fan of (or otherwise has an affinity for) the team opposing the home team, and the neutral fan does not have a preference or affinity for the home team or the
visiting team.  In some embodiments, the live performance may involve more than two teams and/or one or more individuals.  In some embodiments, the excitement levels, curves, alerts and teasers described herein can be generated separately for home team
fans, visiting team fans and neutral fans.  When the live performance involves more than two teams and/or one or more individuals, the excitement levels, curves, alerts and teasers described herein can be generated separately for each of the multiple
teams and/or individuals.  Teasers are brief summaries of one or more compelling aspects of a performance in progress.  They may be constructed from fixed text and/or one or more regular expressions that may include (but are not limited to) team names,
player names, period/quarter/half, time elapsed, time left, scores, statistics, plays, other game events, player or team performance notes, and game situations.
<br/><br/> Excitement levels, curves, alerts and teasers can also be generated for other groups of people.  For example, excitement levels, curves, alerts and teasers described herein can be generated separately for different subscribers based on
subscriber's affinity for fast paced games, games with huge momentum swings, games with great historical context, or other categories.  Example subscriber categories may relate to the type of event that a subscriber finds exciting, such as a crash within
an auto racing performance or an occurrence of a fight during a hockey game.
<br/><br/> In another set of embodiments, the disclosed technology generates alerts and teasers when the live performance begins to get exciting.  The teasers include sentence fragments that explain why the live performance is exciting.  Different sets of
alerts and teasers are generated for different categories of subscribers.
<br/><br/> In another set of embodiments, the disclosed technology generates teasers at all times during a live performance, whether or not the performance is at a level of excitement to trigger one or more alerts.
<br/><br/> The different sets of excitement levels, excitement curves, alerts and teasers are reported to a plurality of subscribers based on one or more subscriber preferences.  In one example, the subscriber preferences include a list of the subscriber's
favorite sports, favorite teams, favorite players, types of sport (for example, low scoring games).  Subscriber preferences may also include whether the subscriber wishes to receive alerts and teasers related to the live performance and the subscriber's
desired alert level.  The alert level relates to the number of alerts that the subscriber wishes to receive during a live performance and when the subscriber wishes to be notified of such alerts.  Subscriber preferences may also include a subscriber's
display preference for viewing the different sets of excitement levels, excitement curves, alerts and teasers related to the live performances.  Some subscribers may wish to view the different excitement curves depending on whether they are a home team
fan, a visiting team fan, or a neutral fan.  Others may wish to just view a subset of the excitement curves.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the different sets of excitement levels are reported to the plurality of subscribers as different sets of excitement curves.  The different sets of excitement curves graphically represent the different sets of excitement
levels over different points in time during the live performance.  In one example, the excitement level for a live performance is a rating given to the live performance on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being a boring event and 100 being an extremely
exciting event.  In one set of examples, three (or more) excitement curves are generated: one for the home team fan, one for the visiting team fan and one for the neutral fan.  In other examples, additional excitement curves are generated, such as for a
fan who does not like one of the teams, a fan who likes a team that is a rival to one of the teams or a fan who likes any close game.  Subscribers can view the excitement curves to decide whether to tune in to a live performance or watch a recorded
performance.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, subscribers may view the different sets of excitement levels, excitement curves, alerts and teasers related to multiple live performances, access real-time content related to the live performance and the like, via an Internet
based web site or using an application (collectively referred to herein as a "Sports Excitement Rating Application 100") on a computing device (e.g., cellular telephone, laptop computer, desktop computer, tablet computer, smart appliance, etc.) that is
referred to herein as the client device.  FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B are exemplary user-interface screens in the subscriber's client device via which a subscriber can interact with a service that provides the excitement levels, excitement curves, alerts and
teasers described herein.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1A is an exemplary user-interface screen depicted on the client device that is used to obtain one or more subscriber preferences from a subscriber.  In one example, one or more subscriber preferences such as the subscriber's favorite
sports, favorite teams, whether the subscriber wishes to receive alerts and teasers related to one or more live performances and the subscriber's desired alert level are obtained from the subscriber via the Sports Excitement Rating Application 100.  This
information can then be stored on the client device and/or transmitted to a server for the service associated with the Sports Excitement Rating Application 100.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1B is an exemplary user-interface screen that displays different sets of excitement curves to a subscriber based on the subscriber preferences obtained in FIG. 1A.  For example, if the subscriber's favorite teams included the home team in a
live performance, then a game excitement curve related to the home team sentiment is displayed to the subscriber.  In one embodiment, if the subscriber's favorite teams included both the home team and the visiting team participating in the live
performance, then a game excitement curve related to both the home team and the visiting team sentiments are displayed to the subscriber.
<br/><br/> In the exemplary illustration of FIG. 1B, different excitement curves for the home team fans, visiting team fans and neutral fans are displayed to a subscriber based on the subscriber's preferences.  In the illustrated example, the y-axis of the
curve includes qualitative assignments made to the excitement levels of a live performance.  In one embodiment, a qualitative assignment of a great game is made to a live performance whose excitement levels are between 85-100, qualitative assignment of a
good game is made to a live performance whose excitement levels are between 65-84, a qualitative assignment of an average game is made to a live performance whose excitement levels are between 40-64 and a qualitative assignment of a dull game is made to
a live performance whose excitement levels are between 0-39.  The x-axis of the curve illustrates exemplary points in time in the live performance during which the excitement levels are generated.  In the exemplary illustration, a first excitement curve
102 is a game excitement curve for the home team fan, a second excitement curve 104 is a game excitement curve for the visiting team fan and a third excitement curve 106 is a game excitement curve for the neutral fan.  The final excitement levels for the
first excitement curve 102, the second excitement curve 104 and the third excitement curve 106 are 75, 73 and 71 respectively.  While some embodiments will display all three curves, other embodiments display a subset of the three curves.  Additional
embodiments can display more than three curves or different curves.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a block diagram of one embodiment of the hardware components of a system for generating excitement levels, excitement curves, alerts and teasers for a live performance.  In one embodiment, the system of FIG. 2 is described with respect
to generating excitement levels, excitement curves, alerts and teasers for a live sporting performance; however, the teachings herein apply to non-sport related performances.  It is to be appreciated that the technology described herein is not limited to
generating excitement levels, excitement curves, alerts and teasers for a live sports performance.  For example, the technology described herein can be utilized to generate excitement levels, excitement curves, alerts and teasers for a reality TV show, a

<br/><br/> The devices of FIGS. 1-3 discussed above can be used to implement a system that generates different sets of excitement levels, excitement curves, alerts and teasers for one or more live performances for different categories of subscribers.  FIG.
4 is a flow chart describing one embodiment of a process for generating different sets of excitement levels, excitement curves, alerts and teasers for a live performance.  In one embodiment, the process of FIG. 4 is performed in real time.  In one
embodiment, the steps of FIG. 4 may be performed by the software modules in the Application Server 214 and the Analytical Server 216 described in FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B respectively.
<br/><br/> In step 400, a live performance is monitored.  The process of monitoring a live performance is discussed in more detail in FIG. 4A.  Although the process of FIG. 4 is described with respect to monitoring a single live performance, it is to be
appreciated that the process of FIG. 4 may be performed for multiple performances (in parallel or serially).
<br/><br/> In step 402, different sets of excitement levels are generated for the live performance for different categories of subscribers.  In one set of examples, the different categories of subscribers include home team fans, visiting team fans and
neutral fans.  The process by which different sets of excitement levels are generated for the different categories of subscribers is discussed in more detail in FIG. 4C.
<br/><br/> In step 404, the different sets of excitement levels are reported to a plurality of subscribers.  The process by which the different sets of excitement levels are reported to a plurality of subscribers is discussed in more detail in FIG. 4D and
FIG. 4E
<br/><br/> In step 406, it is determined if one or more of the excitement levels generated in step 402 are at or above one or more excitement thresholds.  In accordance with the disclosed technology, in order to notify subscribers when a live performance
begins to get sufficiently exciting, it is determined if an excitement level is at or above a certain value for a specific amount of time.  This value is referred to herein as an excitement threshold.  Excitement thresholds are discussed in more detail
with respect to FIG. 5.  If, in step 406, it is determined that none of the excitement levels generated in step 402 are at or above one or more excitement thresholds and the live performance has not ended, then the process continues to monitor the live
performance in real-time in step 400.
<br/><br/> If there are one or more of the excitement levels that are at or above one or more excitement thresholds for sufficient amount of time (step 406), then in step 408 one or more different sets of alerts are generated for the different categories
of subscribers.  The process of generating different sets of alerts is discussed in more detail with respect to FIG. 5.  In step 410, different sets of teasers are generated for the different categories of subscribers.  The process of generating
different sets of teasers is discussed in detail in FIG. 6.  In step 412, the different sets of alerts and teasers are reported to a plurality of subscribers.  The process of reporting the different sets of alerts and teasers is discussed in detail in
FIG. 7.
<br/><br/> In step 414, it is determined if the live performance has ended.  If the live performance has ended, the process ends in step 416.  If the live performance has not ended, then the process continues to monitor the live performance in real-time in
step 400.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4A is a flow chart describing a process for monitoring a live performance in real-time.  The process of FIG. 4A is one example of performing step 400 of FIG. 4.  In one embodiment, the process of monitoring a live performance is performed
by the Data transformation module 228 in the Analytical server 216.
<br/><br/> In step 418, schedule updates, player rosters and statistics related to an upcoming live performance are received from one or more Data Providers 222.  The data can be received electronically via the Internet or by other means.  In step 420, an
input data stream comprising real-time updates related to the live performance is accessed or received.  In one embodiment, the input data stream comprises files (or other data strictures) of play-by-play statistics related to the live performance.  In
some embodiments, the input data stream is acquired from Data Providers 222.  In other embodiments, the input data stream may be generated manually by subscribers viewing the live performance or by one or more computers that process the video of the live
performance.
<br/><br/> In step 422, the input data stream is analyzed.  In one embodiment, analyzing the input data stream includes transforming the information in the input data stream into a common data structure format of play events that describes an individual
play or action of the live performance in a structured way.  FIG. 4B is an exemplary illustration of the representation of an input data stream as a common data structure of play events related to the live performance.  In one embodiment, the data
structure of play events 428 represents a set of real-time measured attributes related to the live performance.  The set of real-time measured attributes may include, but are not limited to a game ID, a game clock time, a game score, a play description,
an event type ID, a position on the field, type of play, players involved, player statistics, schedule updates and current team scores.  Additional context data can also be included The real-time measured attributes may also include real-time updates
related to the live performance received from social networking or other communication services such as Twitter.RTM.  feeds, Facebook.RTM.  updates or real-time updates received from one or more third party information sources.
<br/><br/> In step 424, one or more events of interest in the live performance are identified, based on the analysis.  In one example, identifying an event of interest may include identifying a nail-biter event.  As used herein, a nail-biter event refers
to a situation or activity during the live performance wherein the outcome of the situation or activity is so uncertain that it causes the live performance to become more exciting than usual.  For example, in a live sports performance, a nail-biter event
is identified as an event in which the score is close, the lead can change at any moment and there is only time left for one more score or a small number of scores.  In another embodiment, a nail-biter event can also be identified when or more excitement
levels are at or above one or more excitement thresholds as discussed in FIG. 5.  Other events of interest can also be identified, such as baseball game with a potential no-hitter, overtime in soccer, a shutout in American football, etc.
<br/><br/> In step 426, the event of interest is reported to a plurality of subscribers on their client devices.  In one example, the event of interest is reported to the plurality of subscribers along with an excitement level related to the live
performance.  In one embodiment, the Excitement Level Results Module 226 in the Application Server(s) 214 reports the events of interest to the plurality of subscribers on their client devices.  In some embodiments, the events of interest are reported by
alerts and teaser, rather than separately as described in FIG. 4A.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the input data stream is analyzed over different time-intervals.  In one embodiment, a first time-interval is measured from the start of the live performance to a current point in time during the live performance.  In another
embodiment, a second time-interval is measured from a point in time after the start of the live performance to a current point in time during the live performance.  For example, the input data stream is analyzed for the most recent X minutes.  In this
manner, the input data stream is analyzed over two time-intervals or time-windows.  In other embodiments, more than two time-intervals may also be used.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the analysis of the input data stream over different time intervals results in the generation of different types of excitement levels related to the live performance.  The generation of excitement levels is discussed in detail
in FIG. 4C.  In one embodiment, analyzing the input data stream over the first time-interval (from the start of the live performance to a current point in time) results in the generation of different sets of final excitement levels (referred to as final
excitement levels) related to the live performance, and analyzing the input data stream over the second time-interval (from a point in time after the start of the live performance to a current point in time) results in the generation of different sets of
instantaneous excitement levels (referred to as the instant excitement levels) related to the live performance.  The duration of the second time-interval may be pre-determined by the system.  The duration of the second time-interval determines how
instantaneous the excitement levels related to the live performance are.  In one example, the duration of the second time-interval is one or a few seconds.  In one embodiment, the final excitement levels are an average of the instant excitement levels.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the analysis of the input data stream over the different time-intervals is implemented using a time-window based decay algorithm.  The time-window based decay algorithm weights events that occur during the live performance
based on when the events occur, wherein events of interest that occur in the past have a smaller impact on the events of interest occurring in the present.  That is, the time-window based decay algorithm is basically a system for reducing the size of the
time-interval towards the end of the live performance.  For example, consider an event of interest such as a score update that occurs during the live performance.  In one embodiment, each time a score update is received in real-time, the value of every
contributing score update that occurred from the start of the live performance is re-calculated to determine the different excitement levels for the live performance.  This results in the generation of final excitement levels for the live performance. 
In another embodiment, each time a score update is received in real-time, only the new score updates that occur within the pre-defined time-interval are considered, the old score-updates outside the time-interval are pushed out, and the score-updates are
re-calculated from those that are within the time-interval to determine the different excitement levels for the live performance.  This results in the generation of instantaneous excitement levels for the live performance.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4C is a flow chart describing a process for generating different sets of excitement levels for a live performance for different categories of subscribers.  The process of FIG. 4C is one example of performing step 402 of FIG. 4.  In one
embodiment, the process of FIG. 4C is performed by the Excitement Level Generation Module 230 in the Analytical server 216.
<br/><br/> In step 430, the system identifies information (for example, in response to the analysis of the input data stream performed in step 422 of FIG. 4A) related to one or more performance attributes.  In one embodiment, the performance attributes
represent specific, gradable and qualified aspects of one or more high-level characteristics of the live performance that quantitatively impact the excitement of the live performance.  In one embodiment, the performance attributes include a velocity
attribute, a parity attribute, a novelty attribute, a momentum attribute and a context attribute related to the live performance.
<br/><br/> The velocity attribute measures the energy level of the live performance.  For example, for a sport such as cricket, the velocity is measured by the number of runs scored per ball or over, or the number of fours and sixes scored within a period
of time.  For a sport such as American Football, the velocity may be measured by the yards per play.
<br/><br/> The parity attribute measures how close two teams are matched throughout the live performance.  The parity attribute also compares how one team scores with respect to the other.  For example, the parity attribute may compare the velocity across
two teams.  It is to be appreciated that for a live performance to be exciting, the parity should ideally be even and the velocity should be high.
<br/><br/> The novelty attribute measures the uniqueness of individual events that occur both before and during a live performance.  A triple play in baseball, a hat trick in soccer or hockey, a comeback, an upset and a last second shot are examples of
events that affect the novelty attribute.
<br/><br/> The momentum attribute relates to the shift in the live performance which defines which player or team is doing better with respect to another player or team.
<br/><br/> The context attribute defines the existence and extent of any rivalry between teams, importance or prominence of the game (for example, a playoff game vs regular season, or a meeting of two highly ranked teams as opposed to two obscure ones),
the impact of a given event on the overall playoff picture, or the importance of a particular game within a playoff series, bracket, or competition.  Note that in other embodiments, other attributes can be used instead of or in addition to the
above-described attributes.
<br/><br/> In step 432, a score for each of the performance attributes in the input data stream is computed.  In one example, a velocity score, a parity score, a novelty score, a momentum score and a context score are computed.  In one embodiment, step 432
includes computing different scores (e.g., three different scores) for each of the performance attributes for the different subscriber categories.  For example, velocity attribute scores for the home team fan, the visiting team fan and the neutral fan
are computed; parity attribute scores for the home team fan, the visiting team fan and the neutral fan are computed; novelty attribute scores for the home team fan, the visiting team fan and the neutral fan are computed; momentum attribute scores for the
home team fan, the visiting team fan and the neutral fan are computed; and context attribute scores for the home team fan, the visiting team fan and the neutral fan are computed.  In such an embodiment, fifteen attribute scores are calculated five for
the home team fan, five for the visiting team fan and five for the neutral fan.  In other embodiments, more or less than three sets of scores are calculated.
<br/><br/> It is to be appreciated that computing different scores for a particular performance attribute results in the generation of different sets of excitement levels for the live performance for the different subscriber categories.  In one embodiment,
computing different scores for a particular performance attribute comprises increasing or decreasing the value of the attribute based on how the value of the attribute affects the excitement of the live performance for the different subscriber
categories.  For example, in cricket, one way by which the velocity attribute is measured is based on the number of runs scored per over.  In one example, the value of the velocity score may be increased by a certain factor to determine a velocity score
for the home team, while the value of the velocity score may be decreased by a certain factor to determine a velocity score for the visiting team.
<br/><br/> In step 434, generic attribute weights are applied to each of the performance attributes for the different subscriber categories.  In one example, the generic attribute weights are computed based on the time elapsed in the live performance.  For
example, the generic attribute weight applied to a velocity attribute at the start of the live performance is higher as compared to the generic attribute weight applied to the parity attribute at the start of the live performance.
<br/><br/> In step 436, a mathematical function (e.g., sum, weighted sum, average, weighted average, or other mathematical function) of the scores and the generic attribute weights applied to each of the performance attributes is computed to generate the
different sets of excitement levels for the live performance, for the different subscriber categories.  In one embodiment, step 436 includes generating three excitement levels: one for the home team fan based on the attributes calculated for the home
team fan, one for the visiting team fan based on the attributes calculated for the visiting team fan, and one for the neutral fan based on the attributes calculated for the neutral fan.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, step 436 includes generating three instant excitement levels (home, visiting and neutral) and three final excitement levels ((home, visiting and neutral).  In one embodiment, only final excitement levels are generated.  In
another embodiment, only instant excitement levels are generated.
<br/><br/> In other examples, additional excitement levels may be generated, such as for a fan who does not like one of the teams, a fan who likes low scoring games, a fan who likes a team that is a rival to one of the teams, a fan who likes any close
game, etc. For example, an excitement level for a fan who likes low scoring games, for a game such as cricket may be determined by increasing or decreasing the velocity score based on the number of runs scored per over during the live performance.
<br/><br/> Additional details relating to computing excitement levels for a live performance is set forth in co-pending patent application Ser.  No. 13/037, 243, filed Feb.  28, 2011, entitled, "Method and System For an Online Performance Service With
Recommendation Module" published as US 2011/0212756 on Sep. 1, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4D is a flow chart describing a process for reporting the different sets of excitement levels for a live performance, to a plurality of subscribers.  The process of FIG. 4D is one example of performing step 404 of FIG. 4.  In one
embodiment, the process of FIG. 4D is performed by the Excitement Level Generation Module 230 in the Analytical Server 216 and the Excitement Level Results Module 226 in the Application server(s) 214.
<br/><br/> In step 438, the different sets of excitement levels for the live performance for the different subscriber categories are received from step 402 of FIG. 4.  In one embodiment, the Excitement Level Results Module 226 in the Application Server(s)
214 receives the different sets of excitement levels from the Excitement Level Generation Module 230 in the Analytical Server 216.  In step 440 it is determined if the different sets of excitement levels correspond to initial excitement levels for the
live performance.  If so, then in step 442 it is determined if different sets of pre-excitement levels for the different categories of subscribers have been computed for the live performance.  As used herein, a pre-excitement level for a live performance
is a predicted excitement level for the live performance prior to the commencement of the live performance.  In one embodiment, the pre-excitement level is computed based on historical information such as prior performance metrics related to the live
performance.  If there is a pre-excitement level for the live performance, then in step 444, the initial excitement levels for the live performance for the different categories of subscribers are adjusted to incorporate the pre-excitement level.  For
example, if the initial excitement level for a live performance is computed as 50 and the pre-excitement level for the live performance is 25, the initial excitement level for the live performance may be computed as an average of the initial and
pre-excitement levels.
<br/><br/> In step 446, different sets of excitement curves are generated for the different categories of subscribers.  In one embodiment, the different sets of excitement curves are a graph of the different sets of excitement levels for the different
categories of subscribers at different points in time during the live performance.  In one embodiment, the excitement curve is a graph of final excitement levels for a live performance from the start of the live performance to a current point in time
during the live performance.  FIG. 1B is an exemplary illustration of different sets of excitement curves generated for different categories of subscribers.
<br/><br/> In step 448, the different sets of excitement curves for the live performance are reported to the plurality of subscribers.  In one embodiment, the different sets of excitement curves for the live performance are reported to the plurality of
subscribers in accordance with the subscribers' preferences.  For example, if the favorite team of a subset of the plurality of subscribers includes the home team in the live performance, then the excitement curve for the home team fan is displayed to
the subset of subscribers.  If, for example, the favorite teams of a subset of the plurality of subscribers include both the home team and the visiting team in the live performance, then an aggregate excitement curve representing the excitement level of
both teams is displayed to the subset of subscribers.
<br/><br/> One embodiment of step 448 includes looking up the subscribers' preference data stored in Database Server 218 and sending the excitement curve for home team fans to subscribers who have preference data indicating that the home team is their
favorite team, sending the excitement curve for visiting team fans to subscribers who have preference data indicating that the visiting team is their favorite team and sending the excitement curve for neutral fans to subscribers who do not have
preference data indicating that the visiting team or the home is their favorite team.  In some embodiment, multiple curves can be sent to and displayed to a subscriber.  In some implementations, all curves (or multiple curves) are sent the subscribers
and the subscribers' client devices automatically determine which curves to display based on the subscribers preference data.  In another implementation, all curves (or multiple curves) are sent the subscribers and the subscriber manually chooses which
curves to display.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the Excitement Level Results Module 226 in the Application server(s) 214 directly reports the different sets of excitement curves for the live performance to a plurality of subscribers in accordance with the subscribers'
preferences by transmitting the different sets of excitement curves electronically to the client devices 206, 208 and 210.  The excitement curves are displayed to the plurality of subscribers via the Sports Excitement Rating Application 220 in the client
devices 206, 208 and 210.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4E is a flow chart describing a process for reporting the different sets of excitement curves to a plurality of subscribers.  The process of FIG. 4E is performed at the subscriber's client device in response to receiving the excitement
curves that are generated in step 446 of FIG. 4D.  In step 450, the different sets of excitement curves for the different categories of subscribers, for the live performance are received.  In step 452, the subscriber is prompted with one or more display
preferences to view the different sets of excitement curves.  In step 454, the subscriber's selection of one or more of the display preferences is obtained, via the Sports Excitement Rating Application 100 in the subscriber's client device.  In one
embodiment, the display preference of the subscriber may be to view all the different excitement curves for the live performance, namely, the excitement curve for the home team fan, visiting team fan and the neutral team fan.  In another embodiment, the
display preference of the subscriber may be to view just a subset of the excitement curves for the live performance.  In step 456, the different sets of excitement curves are displayed to the subscribers, in accordance with the display preference, via
the Sports Excitement Rating Application 220 in the subscriber's client device.  As described above, the process of FIG. 4E is for the embodiment where multiple curves are sent to the subscriber.  A variation on the process of FIG. 4B includes skipping
step 452 and automatically choosing which curve to display based on the stored subscriber preference (e.g., favorite team).  A different embodiment only sends one (or a subset) of curves to the subscriber based on subscriber preference stored at the
server.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, reporting the different sets of excitement curves to a plurality of subscribers includes providing a watch-from-time for subscribers to start watching an exciting event related to the live performance, for example, when
subscribers do not have the time to commit to watching the entire performance.  FIG. 4F is a flowchart describing one embodiment of a process for determining a time to start watching a live performance.  In one embodiment, the process for determining a
time to start watching a live performance is performed by the Excitement Level Results Module 226 in the Application Server(s) 214.  In step 458, the different sets of excitement curves for the different categories of subscribers are analyzed to identify
peak excitement levels in the different excitement curves.  The different sets of excitement curves may be generated as discussed in step 446 of FIG. 4D, in one embodiment.  In one example, the peak excitement level refers to the highest excitement level
that is obtained in an excitement curve.  In step 460 different watch-from-times for the different sets of excitement curves of the live performance are determined based on the peak excitement levels.  In one embodiment, the watch-from-time refers to a
time that precedes the peak excitement level of the live performance by a specified amount of time.  The specified amount of time is used to build up the subscriber's excitement that leads to the peak excitement level and may be pre-determined by the
system, in one embodiment.  In step 462, the different watch-from-times of the live performance are reported to the plurality of subscribers by the Excitement Level Results Module.  In one example, the watch-from-time is reported as a specific time to
start watching an exciting event in the live performance.  In step 464, the different watch-from-times of the live performance are displayed to the plurality of subscribers via the Sports Excitement Rating Application 220 on the subscriber's client
device.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, after computing a watch-from-time based on the appropriate excitement curve and thresholds, the events in the play by play may be scanned to determine if the watch-from-time should be modified to include an important event
that might otherwise lie outside the established excitement thresholds.  Examples of this include a goal in soccer that occurs just before the watch-from-time or a punt in football that begins the start of a drive that later crosses the excitement
thresholds.
<br/><br/> In some embodiment of the disclosed technology, alerts are generated to notify subscribers that a live performance is exciting.  Different sets of alerts are generated for different subscriber categories based on the different sets of excitement
levels.  FIG. 5 is a flow chart describing a process for generating different sets of alerts for a live performance, for different subscriber categories.  In one embodiment, the process for generating different sets of alerts is performed by the
Excitement Alert Generation Module 232 in the Analytical Server 214.  The process of FIG. 5 is one example of performing step 408 of FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> In step 500, the different sets of excitement levels for the live performance that are at or above one or more excitement thresholds are received (for example, in response to determining if one or more excitement levels are at or above one or
more excitement thresholds in step 406 of FIG. 4).  In one embodiment, the Excitement Alert Generation Module 232 receives the different sets of excitement levels from the Excitement Level Generation Module 230.  In one set of examples, the different
sets of excitement levels received from the Excitement Level Generation Module 230 correspond to final excitement levels related to the live performance.
<br/><br/> In accordance with the disclosed technology, in order for a subscriber to receive alerts only when a live performance begins to get exciting, a subscriber is not notified that a live performance is exciting as soon as an excitement level is at
or crosses an excitement threshold.  Rather, an excitement alert is sent to a subscriber when the excitement level is at or above an excitement threshold for a specific amount of time.  Accordingly, the disclosed technology minimizes the generation of
alerts that are false positives or false negatives.
<br/><br/> In one implementation of the disclosed technology, an alert bucket is created for every excitement level received (in step 500) that is at or above an excitement threshold.  In one set of examples, a first alert bucket is created for excitement
levels that are at or above a first excitement threshold of 75, a second alert bucket is created for excitement levels that are at or above a second excitement threshold of 90 and a third alert bucket is created for excitement levels that are at or above
a third excitement threshold of 99.  In another set of examples, more than three alert buckets may be created.  For example, alert buckets may be created for every excitement level that is received whose value is a multiple of 3 between 0 and 100.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, different alert buckets are created for different excitement levels that correspond to the different subscriber categories.  In one set of examples, alert buckets for a home team fan, a visiting team fan and a neutral fan are
created.  It is to be appreciated that in some embodiments, the different sets of excitement levels that are at or above one or more excitement thresholds (received in step 500) may include only an excitement level for the home team fan.  In this case an
alert bucket is created only for the home team fan.  In another embodiment, the different sets of excitement levels that are at or above one or more excitement thresholds (received in step 500) may include excitement levels for the home team fan and the
visiting team fan.  In this case, alert buckets are created for the home team fan and the visiting team fan.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the initial size of an alert bucket corresponds to the amount of time (ie in minutes) required to trigger the one or more alerts for the excitement levels that are at or above one or more excitement thresholds.  The size of
the alert bucket can reduced over time or reduced near the end of the event.
<br/><br/> In step 502 of FIG. 5, the amount of time (in minutes) required to trigger one or more alerts for the excitement levels that are at or above the one or more excitement thresholds is determined.  In one embodiment, the amount of time (in minutes)
required to trigger an excitement alert is pre-determined by the system and is computed using equation (1) shown below: Amount of time (in minutes)=15-0.625*(Excitement threshold*(20-8))-0.15625*(time in minutes elapsed in live performance) (1)
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the amount of time is reduced by a rate based on a function of how much the current excitement level is above the excitement threshold.  Accordingly, in step 504, the rate at which to reduce the amount of time required to
trigger the different sets of alerts for the excitement levels is determined.  In one embodiment, the rate at which to reduce the amount of time required to trigger the different sets of alerts is determined based on a difference between the current
excitement level and the excitement threshold and is determined using equation (2) as shown below: Rate=1.0+0.1*max(0,(Current Excitement Level-Excitement Threshold-5)) (2)
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the amount of time is increased by a rate based on a function of how much the current excitement level is below the excitement threshold.  Accordingly, in step 504, the rate at which to increase the amount of time required
to trigger the different sets of alerts for the excitement levels is determined.  In one embodiment, the rate at which to increase the amount of time required to trigger the different sets of alerts is determined based on a difference between the current
excitement level and the excitement threshold and is determined using equation (3) as shown below: Rate=1.0+0.1*max(0,(Excitement Threshold-Current Excitement Level-5)) (3)
<br/><br/> It is to be appreciated that an excitement alert for a live performance which is at a current excitement level of 85 will be triggered faster than an excitement alert which is at a current excitement level of 80, given an excitement threshold of
75, based on the rate computed in equation (2).  Accordingly, in some embodiments, in step 506, it is determined if the different sets of alerts should be triggered instantaneously so that the plurality of subscribers can be notified of the alerts
immediately, based on the rate computed in equation (2).  In one embodiment, an excitement alert will be triggered instantaneously if a nail-biter event is identified at the one or more of the excitement levels.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, an excitement alert will be triggered instantaneously when an excitement level is above the excitement threshold and the amount of time remaining in the live performance is less than a threshold value.  The threshold value
may be pre-determined by the system.  For example, if the threshold value specifies that only ten minutes are remaining in the live performance and the excitement level is at a first excitement threshold of 75, an excitement alert will be triggered
instantaneously to the plurality of subscribers to notify the subscribers that the live performance is exciting.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, in step 506, if a nail-biter event is identified at any of the excitement levels and/or if the amount of time remaining in the live performance is less than a threshold value, then the amount of time required to trigger the
different sets of alerts at the different sets of excitement levels is instantaneously reduced to zero minutes in step 508.  In step 514, the different sets of alerts are reported to the plurality of subscribers.  In one example, reporting the alert
includes reporting a teaser in the form of a text message such as "Exciting Game", along with optionally reporting the current excitement level of the live performance.  The manner in which the different sets of alerts are reported to a plurality of
subscribers is discussed in FIG. 7.  In one example, in step 514, when the subscriber is notified of a nail-biter event, the excitement level that is reported to the subscriber is an average of the instantaneous excitement level and the final excitement
level.
<br/><br/> In step 506, if no nail-biter event is identified at the current excitement level and/or if the amount of time remaining in the live performance is not less than a threshold value, then it step 510, the amount of time required to trigger the
different sets of alerts (obtained in step 502) is reduced by the rate determined in step 504 to obtain the remaining time required to trigger the different sets of alerts for the different sets of excitement levels.  In one example, the remaining time
required to trigger an excitement alert for an excitement level is computed as the difference between the amount of time (computed in equation (1)) and the rate (computed in equation (2)) as shown in equation (3) below: Remaining time (in minutes)=Amount
of time (in minutes)-Rate (in minutes) (4)
<br/><br/> For example, consider that the current excitement level related to a live performance is 75.  For purposes of this example, the current excitement level may correspond to an excitement level generated for the home team fan, the visiting team fan
or the neutral fan.  In one example, the current excitement level is determined to be at a first excitement threshold of 75.  If the time in minutes elapsed in the live performance is 30 minutes, the amount of time required to trigger an excitement alert
for the current excitement level of 75 is determined as shown in equation (4) below: Amount of time (in minutes)=15-0.625*(0.75*(20-8))-0.15625*(30)=4.6 minutes (5)
<br/><br/> The amount of time (computed in equation (4)) is then reduced by a rate based on a function of how much the current excitement level is above the excitement threshold.  In the above example, the rate at which to reduce the amount of time
required to trigger an excitement alert at the current excitement level of 75 is computed as shown in equation (5) below.  Rate=1.0+10*max(0,(0.75-0.75-0.05))=1 minute (6)
<br/><br/> Therefore, in the above example, the amount of remaining time required to trigger an alert for a current excitement level 75 which is at an excitement threshold of 75 is reduced to (4.6 minutes-1 minute)=3.6 minutes.
<br/><br/> Now consider that a new excitement level is generated and the current excitement level has changed to 85.  The rate at which to reduce the amount of time required to trigger an excitement alert at the current excitement level of 85 is computed
as shown in equation (6) below.  Rate=1.0+10*max(0,(0.85-0.75-0.05))=1.5 minutes (7)
<br/><br/> Now, based on the new rate determined in equation (6), the amount of time required to trigger an excitement alert for an excitement level of 85 at the excitement threshold of 75 is further reduced to (4.6 minutes-1.5 minutes)=3.1 minutes.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the amount of remaining time to trigger an alert is calculated separately for the home team fan, the visiting team fan and the neutral fan.  Therefore, home team fans may receive an alert, while visiting team and neutral
fans do not (or vice versa or other permutation).
<br/><br/> In step 512, it is determined if the amount of time required to trigger the alerts has reached a pre-determined value.  In one example, the amount of time reaches a pre-determined value when the difference between the amount of time (computed in
equation (1)) and the rate (computed in equation (2)) is equal to zero minutes.  In the example discussed in equations (4), (5) and (6) above, the amount of time required to trigger an excitement alert for an excitement level which is at an excitement
threshold of 75 is determined to be 3.1 minutes.  In one example, an excitement alert for the excitement level which is at the excitement threshold of 75 will be triggered when the difference between amount of time and the rate becomes zero minutes.
<br/><br/> If the amount of time has reached the pre-determined value, then the process of FIG. 5 performs step 412 of FIG. 4 to report the alert for the live performance in step 514.  In one set of examples, different sets of alerts for different
subscriber categories (that is, for a home team fan, a visiting team fan and a neutral fan) are reported to the plurality of subscribers in accordance with the subscriber preferences.  The process by which the different sets of alerts are reported to a
plurality of subscribers is discussed in FIG. 7.  In step 512, if it is determined that there is still time remaining to trigger the alerts then the process loops back to step 500 to receive the next set of excitement levels for the live performance.
<br/><br/> The process of FIG. 5 discussed above can be used to implement a method to generate different sets of alerts for a plurality of live performances for different categories of subscribers.  In another embodiment of the disclosed technology,
different sets of teasers are generated based on the different sets of alerts.  In one embodiment, a teaser includes sentence fragments about an excitement alert that explains why the live performance is exciting.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a flow chart describing a process for automatically generating different sets of teasers for a live performance, for different subscriber categories (ie home team fan, visiting team fan and neutral fan).  The process of FIG. 6 is one
example of performing step 410 of FIG. 4.  In step 600, different sets of alerts related to the live performance are received (for example, from step 408 of FIG. 4).  In one embodiment, the Teaser Generation Module 234 receives different sets of alerts
from the Excitement Level Generation Module 230 in the Analytical Server 216.  In one embodiment, a single teaser is generated for a live performance.  In other embodiments, different sets of teasers are generated for different subscriber categories
(e.g., different teasers for home team fans, visiting team fans and neural team fans) based on the different sets of alerts.  That is, an alert for a home team fan will have a teaser selected for the home team fan, an alert for a visiting team fan will
have a different teaser selected for the visiting team fan, and an alert for a neutral fan will have a different teaser selected for the neutral fan.  In other embodiments, the home team fan, the visiting team fan and/or the neutral fan can receive the
same teaser.
<br/><br/> In step 602, one or more sets of rules for one or more teaser categories are accessed.  In one embodiment, the sets of rules are accessed from the Teaser dictionary 238 in the Analytical Server 216.  In one set of examples, teaser categories for
a live sports performance may include, but are not limited to, parity, velocity, defense, comeback and nail-biter.  In one embodiment, the rules for each teaser category define whether a particular excitement alert is relevant to a respective teaser
category.  For example, consider that one or more alerts related to a home team fan, a visiting team fan and a neutral fan are received.  The sets of rules for each teaser category are analyzed to determine if any of the alerts are relevant to one or
more of the teaser categories.  For example, a set of rules for the "parity" teaser category may include a set of conditions such as "no hitter flag for the pitching team=TRUE, nail-biter flag=TRUE and parity value=0.9 for one or more of the alerts to be
relevant to the "parity" teaser category.
<br/><br/> In step 604, one or more relevant teaser categories, based on the sets of rules are identified for each of the alerts, for the different subscriber categories.  For example, a velocity teaser category and a defense teaser category may be
identified to be relevant to an excitement alert for the home team fan whereas a parity teaser may be identified to be relevant to an excitement alert for a visiting team fan, and so on.
<br/><br/> The different teaser categories each are assigned a priority.  In step 606, a chosen teaser category of the relevant teaser categories as having the highest priority is identified for each of the different alerts.  In one implementation, the
teaser categories are organized in a hierarchy, wherein each category is assigned a competitive code that represents a particular aspect of the category that is worth noting.  In one example, a chosen teaser category having the highest priority is
identified as the category with the maximum competitive code.
<br/><br/> In step 608, the set of rules for the chosen teaser category are accessed to identify one or more pre-stored teasers related to the chosen teaser category.  In one example, the pre-stored teasers are text and (optionally) a set of variables such
as, "No Hitter for &lt;#team_name&gt; in &lt;#inning&gt;" where &lt;#team_name&gt; and &lt;#inning&gt; are variables.  In one embodiment, one or more pre-stored teasers are identified for the different subscriber categories (one or more for home team
fans, one or more for visiting team fans and one or more for neutral fans).  If no pre-stored teasers are identified, but the excitement alert indicates that the live performance is exciting, a default teaser is selected.  The rules can be set up to
choose teasers based on the excitement level performance attributes (see step 432 of FIG. 4C), information from the input data stream (see step 420 of FIG. 4A), the play events (see FIG. 4B) and/or other data to find relevant teasers.
<br/><br/> The various teasers will each be associated with a static or dynamic priority.  A dynamic priority changes based on excitement level performance attributes (see step 432 of FIG. 4C), information from the input data stream (see step 420 of FIG.
4A), and/or the play events (see FIG. 4B).  In step 610, the highest priority teaser of the one or more relevant teasers identified in step 608 is chosen.  In one embodiment, a teaser of a highest priority is identified based on assigning weights to each
of the relevant pre-stored teasers.  The weights are assigned based on a degree to which each of the pre-stored teasers satisfy the rules of the chosen teaser category.  A teaser of a higher priority is identified as the teaser which has the higher
weight.  In one embodiment, teasers of highest priority are separately identified for the different subscriber categories, such as the home team fan, the visiting team fan and the neutral fan.
<br/><br/> In step 612, the process performs step 412 of FIG. 4 to report the different sets of teasers to a plurality of subscribers.  The process of reporting the different sets of teasers is discussed in detail in FIG. 7.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a flow chart describing a process for reporting different sets of alerts and teasers to a plurality of subscribers.  The process of FIG. 7 is one example of performing step 412 of FIG. 4.  In one embodiment, the process of FIG. 7 is
performed by the Excitement Level Results Module 226 in the Application server 214.  In step 700, the different sets of alerts and teasers for the different categories of subscribers are received (for example, in response to generating the different sets
of alerts in step 408, and generating the different sets of teasers in step 410 of FIG. 4).  In one embodiment, the Excitement Level Results Module 226 in the Application server 214 receives the different sets of alerts and teasers from the Excitement
Alert Generation Module 232 and the Teaser Generation Module 234 in the Analytical Server 216.  In one set of examples, alerts and teasers for the different subscriber categories such as the home team fan, the visiting team fan and the neutral fan may be
received in step 700.  In another set of examples, alerts and teasers for only a subset of the different subscriber categories may be received.
<br/><br/> In step 702, the different sets of alerts and teasers are reported to a plurality of subscribers in accordance with an alert level specified by the subscribers.  For example, messages are sent via the Internet and one or more networks (wired and
wireless) to the one or more client devices.  In one embodiment, subscribers may specify a desired alert level based on when they wish to be notified of alerts in a live performance.  A first alert level is specified by subscribers who wish to receive
alerts when the excitement levels of the live performance are at or greater than an excitement threshold of 75.  Such subscribers are referred to herein as Fanatics.  A second alert level is specified by subscribers who wish to receive alerts when the
excitement levels of the live performance are at or greater than an excitement threshold of 90.  Such subscribers are referred to herein as Enthusiasts.  A third alert level is specified by subscribers who wish to receive alerts when the excitement
levels of the live performance are at or greater than an excitement threshold of 99.  Such subscribers are referred to herein as Casual Fans.  It is to be appreciated that a subscriber who is a Fanatic will receive more alerts than a subscriber who is an
Enthusiast or a Casual Fan.  It is also to be appreciated that a subscriber who is a Fanatic will receive alerts earlier in an event compared to subscribers who are Enthusiasts or Casual Fans.  The levels for the Fanatic, Enthusiast and Casual Fan can be
changed from the levels described above.
<br/><br/> In step 704, the different sets of alerts and teasers are displayed to the plurality of subscribers via the Sports Excitement Rating Application 100 in the subscriber's client device.  In one example, an excitement alert and a teaser for a live
performance that is displayed to a subscriber may include a text message such as "Giants at Dodgers, the lead keeps changing", Excitement Level=79/100 or "An offensive explosion in Toronto." Many different forms of the text for a teaser can be used.  As
described, different teasers are sent to different subscriber categories based on different excitement levels.  For example, home team fans may receive different teasers with different alerts at different times than visiting team and/or neutral fans.
<br/><br/> Note that teasers are relevant for other alert types and can be triggered without reaching specific alert levels.  In regard to the latter, teasers can be triggered in conjunction with alerts based on events or excitement level in a fantasy
match-up; individual athletic performances for favorite athletes, athletes who went to a specific college, athletes on a fantasy team, etc.; notifications sent to a fan by friends or sports experts; a notification sent for a favorite team or athlete
indicating an upcoming event about to start, a periodic game update, or a scoring event notification; a notification sent out to communicate that a specific event or athletic performance may represent a potentially valuable wagering opportunity or that
one of a person's wagers is currently in a state of great uncertainty and, thus, excitement.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the step of FIGS. 4, 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F, 5, 6 and 7 are performed automatically.
<br/><br/> In addition to generating excitement levels during live performances, one embodiment includes generating excitement levels for upcoming performances (predicted excitement) before the performance.  Thee generates excitement levels for upcoming
performances by mathematically aggregating game context (as defined previously, i.e. team rivalry, playoff race impact, playoff series/game/bracket, etc.), magnitude of the number of comments in the real-time conversation surrounding the given event
leading up to the event (such as in Twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> blogs, sports press, etc.), predicted parity of the upcoming event (e.g., Las Vegas odds/spread), and predicted velocity of the upcoming event (e.g. Las Vegas over-under for combined score).  The
predicted excitement level can fluctuate dynamically as a performance draws closer due to changing odds, updated playoff picture or variations in chatter.  The predicted excitement level for an event is communicated on a 0-100 scale.  In other
embodiments, the predicated excitement level (and/or during-game excitement level) can be restricted to another range (ie 5-95).
