       <p> A method for tracking at least recent contacts and favorite contacts
     across multiple communications services may include collecting, by a
     processor, information associated with a plurality of contact
     interactions of a user from each of a set of different communications
     services utilized by the user. The method may also include storing, by a
     storage device, the information associated with each of the plurality of
     contact interactions. The method may additionally include analyzing the
     information associated with each of the plurality of contact
     interactions. The method may further include determining at least one of
     a list of most recent contacts and a list of favorite contacts from
     analyzing the information associated with each of the plurality of
     contact interactions.

<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A system for tracking at least recent contacts and favorite contacts across multiple communications services, the system comprising: a processor;  a module operating on
the processor, the module being configured to cause the processor to perform a set of functions comprising: collecting information associated with a plurality of contact interactions of a user from each of a set of different communications services
utilized by the user, the plurality of content interactions comprising a plurality of communications between the user and a multiplicity of other users over the set of different communications services;  storing the information associated with each of
the plurality of contact interactions on a storage device;  analyzing the information associated with each of the plurality of contact interactions;  determining at least one of a list of most recent contacts and a list of favorite contacts from
analyzing the information associated with each of the plurality of contact interactions;  and displaying a graphical user interface showing a network of the user based on at least one of the list of most recent contacts and the list of favorite contacts,
wherein the graphical user interface comprises a symbol identifying each of the multiplicity of other users, the symbol of a particular user of the multiplicity of other users being automatically set by the system to a first symbol comprising a first
shape in response to the particular user being on the list of most recent contacts based on analyzing the information associated with each of the plurality of contact interactions, and the symbol of the particular user being automatically set by the
system to a second symbol comprising a second shape different from the first shape in response to the particular user being on the list of favorite contacts based on analyzing the information associated with each of the plurality of contact interaction,

<br/><br/> In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a system for tracking at least recent contacts and favorite contacts may include a mechanism for gathering or collecting information associated with a plurality of contact interactions
or usage across multiple communications services, a mechanism for analyzing the information or usage, and a mechanism for providing the results of the analysis in a manner which is usable.  As used herein a communications service may include but is not
necessarily limited to communications systems, communications networks or social networks for communications between users, such as email, IM, chart, online forums, Lotus Notes.RTM., Sametime.RTM., IBM Connections, Facebook.RTM., LinkedIn.RTM.  or
similar communications systems, networks or services.
<br/><br/> Examples of uses of the results of the analysis of the information associated with the contact interactions or usage may include, but is not necessarily limited to: providing at least a list of recent contacts and a list of favorite contacts; a
typeahead feature that completes a sequence of possible alphanumeric characters and presents one or more possible contacts for selection by the user; providing a graphical user interface (GUI) displaying a user's network of contacts or social networks
for each communications service or a combined representation of the user's networks or social networks; and any other practical applications of the contact lists across the multiple communications services resulting from the analysis of the information. 
The favorite contact list may be a list of contacts that the user communicates with at least a predetermined number of times over a preset time period.  The typeahead feature may also be described as providing high-speed search results based off a
partial query while the user is typing in a graphical user interface (GUI), such as an address field of a communications service application.
<br/><br/> Examples of mechanisms for gathering information related to contact interactions may include posting information associated with each contact interaction to the system, batching multiple contact interactions, pull/push of contact information
from/to the system.  The system may maintain an database of contact activity across the multiple communications services using either proprietary or standard mechanisms for gathering the information associated with the contact interactions or usage.
<br/><br/> The mechanism for analyzing the information leverages this data to compute derived contact lists which may include a list of recently used contacts of the user and a list of most commonly used contacts over time (favorite contacts).  These lists
may be updated either real-time or periodically based on new incoming contact interaction information from the collecting mechanism.
<br/><br/> The mechanism for providing the results of the analysis may provide the data or contacts lists through either or both a GUI and programmatic interaction, such as an application programming interface (API).  The GUI may provide simple capability
such as typeahead against this list similar to that previously described, or more advanced capability such as network visualization.  The API may be used by other products or communications applications of the user to enhance the contact listing of
people associated with these other services or applications.  In this respect, a more accurate selection list of people or contacts may be provided among the various communications services or applications of the user.  The API may also track activity
across a user's aggregated list of either recent or favorite contacts or both.
<br/><br/> Advantages of the system, method and computer program product described herein provide an improvement in the advantages gained by a single-system of recent and favorite contacts.  Such capabilities in the context of a single
service/system/product may provide a user with a smaller list from which to choose contacts for most interactions as well as being able to better tune capabilities such as activity logs, expert location or network analysis across a user's contacts.  The
collection and analysis across multiple products or communications services may provide a more accurate and consistent list of contacts.  This consistency may be of value in that one is more likely to email not only someone who has emailed recently, but
also someone with whom a user has chatted with recently, for example.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a flow chart of an example of a method 100 for tracking at least one of recent and favorite contacts across multiple communications services in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In block 102, information
associated with a plurality of contact interactions of a user may be collected from each of a set of different communications type services utilized by the user.  One or more mechanisms may be provided for gathering information associated with the
contact interactions from the set of services.  What constitutes a contact interaction or criteria for collecting the information may be determined either by the particular communications service that is the source of the contact interaction information
or a system that analyzes the information associated with each contact interaction.  For example, receiving an email addressed directly to the user might represent a contact interaction for purposed of collecting the information, but being a copied or
cc'ed recipient on an email may not be considered as a contact interaction for purposes of collecting the information associated therewith.  Accordingly, collecting the information associated with each of the plurality of contact interactions may include
collecting the information in response to a message associated with the contact interaction being directly addressed to the user or directly addressed by the user to at least one other user.
<br/><br/> There are numerous mechanisms for gathering or collecting the contact interaction information from a source of the contact interaction information.  For example, the information may be collected per event or contact interaction (each
interaction) or on a batch basis or groups of interactions.  The contact interactions may be grouped based on expiration of each prescheduled time period or after a present number of contact interactions occur.
<br/><br/> The contact interaction information may also be collected or transmitted to a system that at least one of stores and analyzes the information on a pull versus push arrangement.  For example, the source of the contact interaction information may
invoke a mechanism for sending information to the system for storage and analysis or the system may invoke a mechanism for pulling or requesting the information from the source.  The mechanism for collecting the contact interaction information may also
be proprietary or standard mechanism for collecting the information.  The proprietary mechanism may be exclusive to the communications service or source of the contact interaction information and may not be universally applicable over other services or
sources.  A standard mechanism may allow easier integration of additional systems or communications services provided by other vendors.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention, collecting the information associated with the plurality of contact interactions may include transmitting the information associated with each of the plurality of contact interactions to a system that
at least one of stores and analyzes the information associated with each of the plurality of contact interactions each time one of the plurality of contact interactions occurs.
<br/><br/> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, collecting the information associated with the plurality of contact interactions may include transmitting the information associated with each of the plurality of contact interactions to the
system that at least one of stores and analyzes the information after each of a preset number of the plurality of contact interactions occurs.
<br/><br/> In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, collecting the information associated with the plurality of contact interactions may include transmitting the information associated with each of the plurality of contact interactions to the
system that at least one of stores and analyzes the information after expiration of a prescheduled time period.  Collecting the information associated with the plurality of contact interactions may additionally include transmitting the information
associated with each of the plurality of contact interactions to the system in response to a preset number of the plurality of contact interactions occurring before expiration of each prescheduled time period.
<br/><br/> An exemplary implementation of the method 100 or system may provide both a pull and push mechanism.  The pull mechanism may be based on a standard feed format such as Rich Site Summary (RSS) and the push mechanism may be based on an Extensible
Mark-up Language (XML) file.  The push and pull mechanism may be done on a scheduled basis.  For example, a pull function may occur or the system may request or pull any accumulated information associated with contact interactions from the source at
prescheduled time intervals, for instance every hour or some other practical time interval.  A push operation or transmission of information by the source of the contact interaction information may occur in response to a preset number of interactions
being available for pushing or transmitting to the system for analysis.  The method 100 or system may therefore have a scheduling system and administration mechanism to set up contact sources and schedule pull events.  The system may also provide a set
of API entry points, for example Representational State Transfer (REST)-based Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) APIs, to allow source systems to push their interactions either individually or in bulk to the system or database.
<br/><br/> In block 104, the information associated with each contact interaction may be stored on a database.  The database may be associated with the source of the contact interactions or the system that analyzes the contact interaction information.  The
information associated with each of the plurality of contact interactions collected and stored may include at least one of a username or identification of the user and at least one other user or participant associated with the contact interaction.  Other
information or metadata in addition to the username or identification information may also be collected and stored.  Examples of other information that may be collected and stored that may be associated with each of the plurality of contact interactions
may include, but is not necessarily limited to, a time of the contact interaction, an initiator of the contact interaction, a type of contact interaction, identification of other participants in the contact interaction and any other information that may
be desirable in tracking and analyzing the contact interactions or usage of the different communications services of the user.  The type of contact interaction may be the type of communications service used for the interaction, such email, instant
messaging (IM), chat, forum, Facebook.RTM., LinkedIn.RTM., etc. or other type communications service.  Accordingly, the database may include a list of user-to-user interactions and additional metadata associated with each contact interaction.  This
information may be stored in a relational database (RDB) or a non-relational database.
<br/><br/> A user may have different usernames or identifications on the different services.  Accordingly, different usernames or IDs of the same person may need to be correlated across the different services.  Correlation between the usernames or IDs and
a particular user or contact may be determined or requested from a particular user when the user registers with the system.  For example, the user may need to associate a common identification used across all communications services with a username or ID
used with this particular communications service.  Examples of a common identification may include but is not necessarily limited to at least one of a last name and a first name, an electronic address or electronic ID.
<br/><br/> In block 106, the contact interactions information may be analyzed.  The analysis may determine at least one of a list of recent contacts 108 and a list of favorite contacts 110 or other relationships between user and other users or contacts of
the user across the multiple communications services.  The list of recent contacts may include all contact interactions by the user over a preceding, defined period of time.  The list of favorite contacts may be the most frequent or a number of contact
interactions with a particular other user that exceeds a predetermined threshold over a preset time period.  Both lists represent a set of users which the target user most frequently interacts with.  The list of recent contacts is heavily influenced by
time (only those interactions in a particular configurable time period--perhaps a week, for example) and less influenced by the number of interactions.  The list of favorite contacts may be analyzed over a longer time period, for example 6 months, and is
more heavily influenced by number of interactions.  The specific criteria for being on the favorites list may be tuned.  For example, favorite contacts may a predetermined number of contact interactions over a preset time period, for example, require 20
interactions over 6 months, with at least one interaction in each month or other criteria.
<br/><br/> The analysis could be performed at the time the contacts lists are requested.  In another embodiment the analysis may be performed and the lists updated periodically.  Queries may then be applied to the previously computed results.  The periodic
updating may be done on a scheduled basis or the analysis may be performed dynamically when the last computed results are older than a threshold time period, for example, if older than an hour.  Accordingly, the list of most recent contacts may be
re-determined after expiration of a preset time period.  In further embodiment the analysis may be performed and the lists updated on a continuous basis, such as for example each time a communication or contact interaction occurs.
<br/><br/> In block 112, the results of the analysis in block 106 may be used or accessed.  One example of a use of the results of the analysis may include presenting a possible contact (addressee) from a partial query while the user is entering the
contact in a GUI using a typeahead feature that accesses the recent and favorite contacts lists.  Other possible uses may include displaying the recent contacts list in response to a request by the user and displaying the current favorites list in
response to a request.  A GUI may also be displayed showing a social network or networks of the user based on each of the contacts lists.  Examples of GUIs representing different networks or social networks based on the contacts lists are illustrated in
FIGS. 2A, 2B and 2C.  Referring also to FIGS. 2A, 2B and 2C, FIG. 2A may represent an example of a social network 200 of the users recent contacts and FIG. 2B may represent an example of a social network 202 of the users favorite contacts.  An indication
204 may also be displayed in the favorite contacts network 202 of the number of contact interactions associated with each contact during a preset time period.  In the example illustrated in FIG. 2B the indication is the number of contact interactions
associated with each contact.  In another embodiment, the number of contact interactions may be represented by a size of the particular symbol corresponding to each contact.  Accordingly, a contact with more contact interactions would be larger than a
contact with fewer contact interactions and the size of the symbol for a particular contact would be based on the number contact interactions relative to other contacts in the network representation 202.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2C may represent an example of a social network 206 including a combination of both the user's recent and favorite contacts.  Any duplicate contacts in both contacts lists may only be represented once.  In FIG. 2C, the recent contacts,
favorite contacts and contacts in both lists may be distinguished from one another.  For example, the recent contacts may be displayed in a first color and/or shape, the favorite contacts may be displayed in a second color and/or shape and the contacts
that are in both the recent and favorite contacts list may be displayed in a third color and/or shape.  The exemplary social network 206 illustrated in FIG. 2C illustrates the different types of contacts by different symbols.
<br/><br/> Referring back to FIG. 1, in block 114, either of the contacts lists may be filtered based on a predetermined criterion.  For example, the list of most recent contacts and the list of favorite contacts may be filtered based on the source of the
contact interaction information or based on the communications service that generated the contact interaction information.  The contact lists may also be filtered based on a time frame or range of dates that may be entered in a GUI or other mechanism, a
number of contact interactions greater than a predetermined number entered into the GUI or may be filtered based on any other criteria.  A weighting for a particular service or system may also be entered in a GUI for filtering the contact interaction
information based on the service.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a block schematic diagram of an example of a system 300 for tracking at least recent and favorite contacts across multiple communications services in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  The method 100 and other
exemplary features described herein with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2A-2C may be embodied in or performed by the system 300 or components of the system 300 as described below.  The system 300 may include a computer system 302 for use by a user 304 for
tracking the contact interaction and performing the other features or operations similar to those described herein.  The computer system 302 may be any type of computer device capable of performing the functions or operations described herein.
<br/><br/> The computer system 302 may include a processor 306 to control operation of the computer system 302 and a file system 308, memory or similar data storage device.  An operating system 310 may be stored on the file system 308 for running or
