<br/><br/> The present invention relates to a wireless transmitting and receiving unit for providing service or activity in a wireless local access network and a communication method of the same.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND ART
<br/><br/> With the evolution in the WLAN (Wireless Local Access Network), users of mobile terminals (or user equipments), such as laptop computers, are capable of performing their tasks with the help of increased mobility.  For example, the user may be
capable of taking his (or her) laptop computer to a conference room when attending a meeting or conference and may, then, access a local network through the WLAN.
<br/><br/> In a system that is based upon the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering) 802.11 standard, BSS (Basic Service Set) refers to a collection of stations, which have successfully established synchronization.  Additionally, a
Basic Service Area (BSA) refers to an area accommodating members configuring the BSS.  The BSA may differ depending upon propagation characteristics of a wireless medium.  The BSS may essentially be divided into two different configurations, such as an
Independent BSS (IBSS) and an Infrastructured BSS.  Herein, as a BSS configuring a self-contained network, the former corresponds to a BSS that is not authorized to access a Distribution System (DS), and, as a BSS including at least one or more APs
(Access Points) and a distribution system, the latter corresponds to a BSS that uses an AP during all communication procedures generally including communication between the stations.
<br/><br/> The IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard provides transmission rates of 11 Mbps (IEEE 802.11b) and 54 Mbps (IEEE 802.11a), which use an unlicensed band at 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz.  IEEE 802.11g provides a transmission rate of 54 Mbps by applying OFDM (Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexing) at 2.4 GHz, and IEEE 802.11n provides a transmission rate of 300 Mbps for 4 spatial streams by applying MIMO-OFDM.  In the IEEE 802.11n, a channel bandwidth of up to 40 MHz is supported, and, in this case, a transmission
rate of 600 Mbps is provided.
<br/><br/> Recently, diverse types of social networking based services, such as <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, Chatting, Social Commerce, Product Promotion, and so on, are being in the spotlight.  Meanwhile, unlike the conventional social networking method, which is
being serviced through the Internet, SNS services based upon locations, such as department stores, supermarkets, localized personal broadcasting, localized social networking services (SNSs) are under research and development.

<br/><br/> Hereinafter, before describing the exemplary embodiment of the present invention in detail, a brief description will be provided in order to facilitate the understanding of the present invention.
<br/><br/> In the following description, an STA (Station) refers to an arbitrary device including a MAC (Medium Access Control) to a WM (Wireless Medium) and a PHY (PHYsical Layer).  The STA may correspond to an AP STA or a non-AP STA.  However,
hereinafter, unless indicated otherwise, the STA will refer to a non-AP STA.  The STA may also be referred to as other terms, such as UE (user equipment), MS (mobile station), MT (mobile terminal), portable device, interface card, and so on.
<br/><br/> Additionally, in the following description, an AP (Access Point) refers to an arbitrary entity, which has the function of an STA, and which provide access to a distributed service through a WM of associated STAs.  In other words, the AP
corresponds to a medium providing connection to the STA through a wireless medium.  The AP may also be referred to as other terms, such as a centralized controller, a BS (base station), a scheduler, and so on.
<br/><br/> Additionally, in the following description, an MS (Mobile Station) refers to a type of STA, which uses network communication while being in a mobile state.  And, WM (Wireless Medium) refers to a medium that is used for realizing transmission of
PDUs (Protocol Data Units) among peer physical layer (PHY) entities of the WLAN.
<br/><br/> Description of FIG. 1
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a block view showing an IEEE 802.11 system.
<br/><br/> An IEEE 802.11 architecture is configured of multiple components interacting with one another for providing a WLAN, which transparently supports an upper layer with STA mobility.
<br/><br/> A BSS (Basic Service Set) corresponds to a basic component of the IEEE 802.11 LAN.  The IEEE802.11 system shown in FIG. 1 includes two BSSs, wherein each BSS includes two user equipments (STAs) (STA1 to STA4), which correspond to members (or
constituents) of each BSS.  With the BSS of the IEEE 802.11 system, the STAs and the APs communicate with one another.
<br/><br/> The BSS may correspond to an ellipse that is used for describing a coverage area, which allows the member user equipments (STA1 to STA4) of the BSS to maintain communication.  This area corresponds to the so-called BSA (Basic Service Area). 
When a user equipment (STA1 and STA3) deviates from the BSA, the corresponding user equipment may no longer directly communicate with the other user equipments (STA2 and STA4) existing in the BSA.
<br/><br/> Description of FIG. 2
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates a block view showing another IEEE802.11 system.
<br/><br/> The WLAN system includes at least one BSS (basic service set).  The BSS corresponds to a collection of stations (STAs), wherein each station is successfully synchronized in order to communicate with one another.  The BSS may be divided into an
Independent BSS and an Infrastructured BSS.  Additionally, the BSS may exist independently or may configure a component of an extended network, which may be configured of multiple BSSs.  A component of an architecture that is used to interconnect the
BSSs corresponds to a DS (Distribution System).
<br/><br/> The IEEE 802.11 standard logically differentiates a WM (Wireless Medium) from a DSM (Distribution System Medium).  Each logical medium is used by a different component of the architecture and for a different purpose.  The definition of the IEEE
802.11 does not make it impossible for nor require the multiple media to be identical to one another or to be different from one another.
<br/><br/> Understanding that the multiple media are different from one another is fundamental in understanding mobility of the architecture.  An IEEE 802.11 LAN architecture is designated to be independent from physical characteristics of any detailed
embodiment.
<br/><br/> By processing an address respective to destination mapping, and by providing a logical service required for a seamless integration of diverse BSSs, the DS enables the support of mobile device.
<br/><br/> The AP refers to an arbitrary entity having the function of an STA and enabling access to a DS through a WM for associated STAs.
<br/><br/> Data are transmitted between the BSS and the DS through the AP.  It will also be noted that all APs correspond to STAs.  Therefore, the APs correspond to addressable entities.  The addresses used by the APs in order to perform communication over
the WM and DSM are not necessarily identical.
<br/><br/> Data that are transmitted to an STA address of an AP by one of the associated STAs, are always received by a port, which is not being controlled in order to be processed by an IEEE802.1X port access entity.  Additionally, when a controlled port
is licensed (or authorized), the frames conceptually change the DS.
<br/><br/> The DS and BSSs generate a wireless network having an arbitrary size and complexity of the IEEE 802.11 standard.  The IEEE 802.11 standard refers to this form of network as an ESS network.  The ESS corresponds to a combination of BSSs, which are
interconnected by the DS.  The ESS does not include the DS.
<br/><br/> The fundamental concept of the ESS network is that the ESS network appears to look like an IBSS (Independent Basic Service Set) in an LLC (Logical Link Control) layer.  The STAs within the ESS may perform communication, and the STAs may shift
from one BSS to another BSS (within the same ESS), which is transparent to the LLC.
<br/><br/> The IEEE 802.11 standard does not make any assumptions on relative physical positions of the BSSs.  Nevertheless, for example, the following cases are possible.
<br/><br/> a) The BSSs may partially overlay with one another.  This is generally used in order to position continuous coverage within a physical volume.
<br/><br/> b) The BSSs may be physically divided.  Logically, there is no limit in a distance between the BSSs.
<br/><br/> c) The BSSs may be physically positioned in the same location.  This is to provide overlaying characteristics.
<br/><br/> d) One (or more than one) IBSS or ESS network may physically exist in the same space as one (or more than one) ESS network.  This may occur due to diverse reasons.  For example, this may occur when an Ad-hoc network is being operated in a
location including an ESS network, when IEEE 802.11 networks that physically overlay with one another may be set up by a different organization, and when two or more different accesses and security protocols are required in the same location.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 2, BSS1 and BSS2 correspond to Infrastructured BSSs respectively including STA2(AP) and STA3(AP).  BSS1 includes STA1 and STA2(AP).  BSS2 includes STA3(AP) and STA4.  BSS1 and BSS2 are connected to one another by using a DS
(Distribution System).  ESS (extended service set) corresponds to multiple BSSs being connected to one another through the DS.  In the same ESS, a non-AP STA may shift from one BSS to another BSS while performing seamless communication.
<br/><br/> A method of performing AP based localized social communication within a WLAN is defined in this specification.  More specifically, defined herein is a method of transmitting a data frame from the AP, wherein the data frame includes information
on SCAs (Social Communication Activities), which operate within an AP coverage, and information on a social zone, in which the corresponding SCA is being serviced, and having MSs that have received the transmitted data frame to search for a social zone
of an SCA, which the corresponding MS is interested in, so as to receive the data or to communicate with neighboring MSs by using the corresponding SCA method of the social zone.
<br/><br/> The SCA (social communication activity), which is defined in this specification, refers to communication performed between devices that are interested in a same specific social service or social activity.  Unlike the conventional communication
method, which corresponds to a destination oriented communication method, wherein a device transmitting data between devices, such as MS or AP, is aware of the device type of a device receiving the transmitted data and delivers information accordingly,
the devices receive information on the SCA instead of searching for a specific device, search for a communication area respective to the SCA, and communicate with other devices within the corresponding communication area.  Additionally, such SCA may each
have different communication characteristics, and, in order to perform communication between devices being interested in the same SCA, the operation method of the corresponding social activity shall be followed.
<br/><br/> For reference, in this specification, the term device is used as a term including both AP and MS.
<br/><br/> According to the exemplary embodiments disclosed in this specification, an AP, which manages SCAs existing within its coverage, transmits information on the SCA to the MSs, so that a specific SCA can be performed between the AP and an MS or
between an MS and an MS.  At this point, the SCA is serviced within a social zone, which is scheduled by the AP, and, herein, a social zone refers to a radio resource that can be searched by the AP or MS in order to perform the specific SCA and that can
be data transmitted/received.  The social zone may be defined by time-dividing the radio resource or by frequency-dividing the radio resource.  In this specification, in order to describe the definition and actual application example of the social zone,
an example of defining the social zone by time-dividing the radio resource will be provided.
<br/><br/> Description of FIG. 3
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates a drawing disclosing an exemplary format of a beacon signal header (100).  The beacon signal header (100) may, for example, include a portion of a beacon signal frame, which is delivered from an access point to wireless (or
radio) terminals.  As shown in FIG. 3, such an exemplary embodiment of the beacon header (100) includes a beacon interval field (110), a time stamp field (120), a service set identifier (SSID) field (130), a supported transmission rate field (140), a
capacity information field (150), and an SCA information field (160).
<br/><br/> The AP according to an exemplary embodiment disclosed in this specification periodically transmits SCA information, which is included in its own communication range (coverage), to at least one MS through a Social Beacon (SB).  The SCA
information field (160), which is included in the social beacon, may include a Social Communication Activity ID (SCA_ID) field (162) and a Social Zone Information field (164).  The social beacon may include a list of pairing information of (SCA_ID,
social zone information).
<br/><br/> SCA_ID corresponds to information that is pre-arranged between the AP and the MS, and a specific SCA_ID may be mapped to a specific SCA at a one-to-one correspondence.  More specifically, as an example of the SCA_ID, SCAs, such as Chatting,
Social Commerce Inform, Game, and so on, are converted to specific SCA_ID values, and the SCA_ID may be used by the AP for notifying the MS of information on a specific SCA for which a specific social zone is being used.
<br/><br/> The social zone information is used for indicating how a social zone, which is being used for the specific SCA, is configured, and for indicating which communication method is to be applied by the MSs in order to be capable of performing
communication within the corresponding social zone.  The social zone information includes a social zone offset time field (1642), a social zone length field (1644), a social zone interval field (1646), and a social zone system parameter field (1648), and
so on.  Alternatively, the social zone information includes information on a frequency band.  The information of the frequency band includes a starting frequency and an ending frequency.
<br/><br/> The social zone offset time indicates when the corresponding social zone begins (or starts), i.e., a starting time, the social zone length indicates the size of the corresponding social zone, the social zone interval indicates a value respective
to a specific interval at which the special zone is being iterated (or repeated), and the social zone system parameter includes communication parameters and communication protocol information, which the MSs should be aware of in order to perform
communication in the corresponding social zone.
<br/><br/> Herein, the social zone system parameter may include multiple system parameters.  The social zone system parameter may include a communication protocol information field (16482), which is to be used within the corresponding social zone, a
communication format information field (16484), and an information field (16486) on a specific host device, when the corresponding host device optionally exists.  Herein, the communication protocol information of the social zone system parameter is used
when designating a communication method between the devices, and conventional communication protocols, such as WiFi Direct or IEEE 802.11p, may be used or a communication protocol may be newly defined.  The communication format information of the social
zone system parameter may allow the MSs to decide the communication format which is to be used within the corresponding social zone in accordance with the social zone system parameter, and the communication format information also indicates whether or
not such communication is being performed for the purpose of information delivery from one specific device to other multiple devices, or whether the communication format corresponds to communication between multiple arbitrary MSs being interested in the
same SCA and intending to perform communication accordingly.  Furthermore, the host device information of the social zone system parameter includes information designating a specific device, when a device configured to manage and relay the corresponding
SCA exists.
<br/><br/> Description of FIG. 4
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates a conceptual view showing operations performed by an AP for transmitting information on an SCA to MSs through a social beacon and searching for a social zone of an SCA to which MSs that have received the corresponding
information are interested, thereby performing SCA according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Herein, information on a social zone of a first SCA and a second SCA is included in a social beacon, which is transmitted by the AP.  The first SCA corresponds to an SCA designating communication operations performed between multiple MSs (MS1
and MS2) being interested in the first SCA, and the second SCA corresponds to an SCA including an operation of receiving data transmitted from the AP, wherein the receiving operation is performed by MSs (MS3) being interested in the second SCA.
<br/><br/> More specifically, after receiving a social beacon from the AP, MS1 and MS2 search for a first social zone, in which MS1 and MS2 may communicate with one another.  Then, after searching for one another, MS1 and MS2 communicate with one another
in the first social zone.  And, after receiving a social beacon from the AP, in order to perform an SCA of receiving a specific data frame the AP, which corresponds to an SCA that MS3 is interested in, MS3 receives a data frame from the AP in a second
social zone.
<br/><br/> Description of FIG. 5
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates a conceptual view showing a procedure, wherein an AP and MSs are operated in accordance with an AP based SCA communication method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> More specifically, the AP periodically transmits social beacons to MSs (MS1 and MS2) and transmits a data frame on a second social zone (Social Zone 2), wherein the second social zone corresponds to the social zone of the second SCA, which
requires data transmission of the AP.  In case of the first social zone (Social Zone 1), the AP includes information on the first social zone (Social Zone 1) in the social beacon and transmits the corresponding social beacon.  However, in a time
corresponding to the first social zone (Social Zone 1) specific operations associated with the first SCA are not performed, and MSs (MS1 and MS2) that are interested in the first SCA communicate with one another within the first social zone (Social Zone
1).
<br/><br/> In FIG. 5, MS1 wishes to operate with respect to both the first SCA and the second SCA, wherein the first SCA may communicate with a neighboring MS within the first social zone (Social Zone 1), and wherein the second SCA may receive a data frame
from the AP within the second social zone (Social Zone 2).  And, accordingly, MS1 performs the appropriate operations within the first social zone and the second social zone.  Since the second MS only wishes to perform the operations of the first SCA,
the second MS searches for a neighboring terminal within the first social zone of the first SCA and perform communication with the corresponding neighboring terminal
<br/><br/> Description of FIG. 6
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 illustrates a flow chart showing a process of exchanging a command frame and a data frame between MSs or between an AP and an MS in accordance with the AP based SCA communication method according to the exemplary embodiment of the present
invention.
<br/><br/> The AP periodically transmits social beacons to MS1 and MS2 (S110, S120, and S130).  The social beacon includes information on the first SCA and the second SCA.  The information on the first SCA and the second SCA includes identification
information of each corresponding SCA and information on each corresponding social zone.
<br/><br/> According to the first SCA, MS1 and MS2 search for the first social zone (Social Zone 1) and perform communication (S112, S122, and S124).  For example, MS1 and MS2 may select the first SCA based upon the identification information of the first
SCA.  A time interval between step S112, step S 122, and step S124 is decided by a social zone interval, which is defined in the first social zone (Social Zone 1) information.
<br/><br/> According to the second SCA, the AP transmits a data frame to MS2 (S114 and S132).  For example, MS2 may select the second SCA based upon the identification information of the second SCA.  More specifically, MS2 receives a data frame from the AP
within the second social zone (Social Zone 2).  A time interval between step S114 and step S132 is decided by a social zone interval, which is defined in the second social zone (Social Zone 2) information.
<br/><br/> Description of FIG. 7
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 illustrates a block view of an AP (200) and an MS (300) disclosed in the present specification.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 7, the AP (200) includes a storage means (210), a controller (220), and transmitter/receiver (230).  The storage means (210) stores the method according to the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 1 to FIG. 6.  The controller
(220) controls the storage means (210) and the transmitter/receiver (230).  More specifically, the controller (220) executes each of the methods that are stored in the storage means (210).  And, the controller transmits the above-described signals
through the transmitter/receiver (230).
<br/><br/> Additionally, as shown in FIG. 7, the MS (300) includes a storage means (310), a controller (320), and transmitter/receiver (330).  The storage means (310) stores the method according to the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 1 to FIG. 6.  The
controller (320) controls the storage means (310) and the transmitter/receiver (330).  More specifically, the controller (320) executes each of the methods that are stored in the storage means (310).  And, the controller transmits the above-described
signals through the transmitter/receiver (330).
<br/><br/> Accordingly, the above-described embodiments are exemplary in all aspects of the invention and, therefore, should be understood without limitation.  The scope of the present invention is indicated in the following appended claims rather than in
the detailed description provided above.  And, it should be understood that the significance and scope of the appended claims and that all modifications and variations of this invention drawn from their equivalents come within the scope of the appended
