       <p> A function executing device may obtain any of a plurality of screen
     information from a server, and display a screen represented by the
     obtained screen information. The function executing device may store in a
     device-side memory two or more code information corresponding to two or
     more character strings for displaying a first screen in a case where a
     creation instruction for creating a shortcut corresponding to the first
     screen is given, and supply the two or more code information within the
     device-side memory to the server in a case where a selection instruction
     for selecting the shortcut is given. In a case where the two or more code
     information is supplied to the server, the function executing device may
     obtain first screen information that represents the first screen from the
     server, and display the first screen represented by the obtained first
     screen information.

<br/><br/>EMBODIMENT
<br/><br/> (Configuration of System)
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 1, a communication system 2 comprises a multi-function device 10, an intermediation server 50, a PC 90, and a plurality of service providing servers 100, 110.  The multi-function device 10 and the PC 90 are connected with a LAN
4.  The intermediation server 50 and the plurality of service providing servers 100, 110 are connected with an internet 6.
<br/><br/> (Configuration of Multi-Function Device 10)
<br/><br/> The multi-function device 10 is capable of executing multiple functions such as a print function, scan function, copy function, FAX function, etc. The multi-function device 10 is further capable of downloading image data that is being stored in
the service providing servers 100, 110 and executing a download print function (called "DL print function" below) for printing an image represented by the image data.  Further, the multi-function device 10 is further capable of executing a scan upload
function (called "scan UL function" below) for uploading, to the service providing servers 100, 110, the image data created by the multi-function device 10 performing a scan.
<br/><br/> The multi-function device 10 comprises an operation unit 12, a display unit 14, a network interface 16, a print performing unit 18, a scan performing unit 20 and a control unit 30.  The operation unit 12 comprises a plurality of keys.  A user
can input various instructions to the multi-function device 10 by operating the operation unit 12.  The display unit 14 is a display for displaying various types of information.  The network interface 16 is connected with the LAN 4.  The print performing
unit 18 is an inkjet type or laser type, etc. printing mechanism.  The scan performing unit 20 is a CCD or CIS, etc. scanning mechanism.
<br/><br/> The control unit 30 comprises a CPU 32 and a memory 34.  The CPU 32 executes various processes according to programs stored in the memory 34.  The functions of units 40 to 47 are realized by the CPU 32 executing processes according to the
programs.
<br/><br/> In addition to the aforementioned programs, the memory 34 stores a display name table 36.  As shown in FIG. 2, the display name table 36 is a table for storing information in which a display name, a server name, an access token and a PIN code
are associated.  The manner of creating the display name table 36 will be described in detail later.
<br/><br/> (Configuration of Intermediation Server 50)
<br/><br/> The intermediation server 50 is a server for intermediating the provision of service to the multi-function device 10 from the service providing servers 100, 110.  The intermediation server 50 is a server provided by a vendor of the
multi-function device 10.  The intermediation server 50 comprises a network interface 52 and a control unit 60.  The control unit 60 comprises a CPU 62 and a memory 64.  The CPU 62 executes various processes according to programs stored in the memory 64. The functions of units 70, 71 are realized by the CPU 62 executing processes according to the programs.
<br/><br/> Moreover, in addition to the aforementioned programs, the memory 64 stores a plurality of screen information 66 and an ID table 68.  The plurality of screen information 66 and the ID table 68 are stored in advance in the intermediation server 50
by the vendor of the multi-function device 10.  The plurality of screen information 66 includes screen information representing screens (screens 302 to 310, 312 to 316 of FIG. 8; to be described) relating to the print function and scan function that the
multi-function device 10 can execute.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 3, the ID table 68 includes an information type table for storing information in which a character string indicating information type and an ID are associated, a server name table for storing information in which a character
string indicating a server name and an ID are associated, and a screen name table for storing information in which a character string indicating a screen name and an ID are associated.
<br/><br/> Since the intermediation server 50 is storing the ID table 68, a code information creating unit 71 (see FIG. 1) of the intermediation server 50 can encode the character strings shown in the specific example of FIG. 4.  In the specific example of
FIG. 4, e.g., the display name is "Alice".  In this case, the code information creating unit 71 identifies an ID "01" corresponding to "Display Name" from the information type table.  The code information creating unit 71 can create code information
"0105Alice" that indicates the combination of the ID "01" corresponding to "Display Name", the data size (number of bytes) "05" of "Alice", and "Alice".  Although the display name "Alice" can be represented by an ordinary character string "Display
Name=Alice", if the display name "Alice" is represented by the code information "0105Alice", as in the present embodiment, the data size can be reduced.
<br/><br/> The code information creating unit 71 can also encode other character strings in the same manner as in the case for the display name.  For example, in case the PIN code is "1234", instead of representing this by an ordinary character string "PIN
Code=1234", the code information creating unit 71 can create code information "02041234".  Further, in case the server name is "Server A", the code information creating unit 71 identifies an ID "03" corresponding to "Server Name" from the information
type table, and identifies an ID "01" corresponding to "Server A" from the server name table.  Instead of representing this by an ordinary character string "Server Name=Server A", the code information creating unit 71 can create code information "030201"
that indicates the combination of the ID "03" corresponding to "Server Name", the data size (number of bytes) "02" of the ID "01" corresponding to "Server A", and the ID "01" corresponding to "Server A".
<br/><br/> Further, in case the access token is "XXXXXXXX", instead of representing this by an ordinary character string "Access Token=XXXXXXXX", the code information creating unit 71 can create code information "0408XXXXXXXX".  Further, in case the screen
name is "Scan Setting Screen", the code information creating unit 71 identifies an ID "05" corresponding to "Screen Name" from the information type table, and identifies an ID "01" corresponding to "Scan Setting Screen" from the screen name table. 
Instead of representing this by the ordinary character string "Screen Name=Scan Setting Screen", the code information creating unit 71 can create code information "050201" that indicates the combination of the ID "05" corresponding to "Screen Name", the
data size (number of bytes) "02" of the ID "01" corresponding to "Scan Setting Screen", and the ID "01" corresponding to "Scan Setting Screen".
<br/><br/> As described above, by using the ID table 68, the code information creating unit 71 can create code information (e.g., "0105Alice") that has a smaller data size than ordinary character strings (e.g., "Display Name=Alice").  Moreover, by using
the ID table 68, the control unit 60 (more specifically, a screen information supplying unit 70 (see FIG. 1)) can also create (i.e., reproduce) character strings (e.g., "Display Name=Alice") from the code information (e.g., "0105Alice").
<br/><br/> (Configuration of Service Providing Servers 100, 110)
<br/><br/> Each of the service providing servers 100, 110 is a known cloud server for, e.g., "Evernote (Registered Trademark)", "Google (Registered Trademark) Docs", "PICASA (Registered Trademark)", "<b><i>FACEBOOK</i></b> (Registered Trademark)", etc. Moreover, in the
present embodiment, a situation is assumed in which a server name of the service providing server 100 is "Server A" (e.g., "Evernote (Registered Trademark)"), and a server name of the service providing server 110 is "Server B" (e.g., "Google (Registered
Trademark) Docs").
<br/><br/> Each of the service providing servers 100, 110 is capable of providing services to various communication devices including the multi-function device 10.  For example, the service providing servers 100, 110 are capable of executing an image
supply service for supplying image data to the multi-function device 10 in order for the multi-function device 10 to execute the DL print function.  Further, for example, the service providing servers 100, 110 are capable of executing an image storing
service for storing image data obtained from the multi-function device 10 in order for the multi-function device 10 to execute the scan UL function.
<br/><br/> Moreover, the service providing server 100 is a server provided by a first service provider (i.e., a first company), and the service providing server 110 is a server provided by a second service provider (i.e., a second company) that is
different from the first service provider.  The first service provider exposes a first API (Application Program Interface) for receiving a service from the service providing server 100, and the second service provider exposes a second API for receiving a
service from the service providing server 110.  Since the first service provider and the second service provider are different, the first API and the second API are usually different.  In order to receive services from, for example, both the service
providing servers 100, 110, communication devices must be compatible with both the first and the second API (i.e., require a program for utilizing the first API and a program for utilizing the second API).
<br/><br/> For example, in order for the multi-function device 10 to receive services from each of the plurality of service providing servers 100, 110, the multi-function device 10 must be compatible with the plurality of APIs, and must store many
programs.  However, the memory capacity of the memory 34 of the multi-function device 10 is smaller than that of a PC, etc. Consequently, in the present embodiment, the intermediation server 50 is provided so that, without having have to store many
programs in the multi-function device 10, the multi-function device 10 can receive services from each of the plurality of service providing servers 100, 110.  That is, the intermediation server 50 is compatible with a plurality of APIs for the plurality
of service providing servers 100, 110.  In a situation where the multi-function device 10 is to receive a service from a specific service providing server (e.g., the service providing server 100) from among the plurality of service providing servers 100,
110, the intermediation server 50 executes various communications (to be described; e.g., an upload URL request of FIG. 5) with the specific service providing server by using the API for the specific service providing server.  Thereby, despite not being
compatible with the API for the specific service providing server, the multi-function device 10 can communicate image data with the specific service providing server.  That is, the multi-function device 10 can receive a service from each of the plurality
of service providing servers 100, 110 despite not storing many programs for using a plurality of APIs.
<br/><br/> (Advance Preparation by User of Multi-Function Device 10)
<br/><br/> In order for the multi-function device 10 to receive a service from the service providing servers 100, 110, the user of the multi-function device 10 (called "specific user" below) must execute the following advance preparation.  The specific
user accesses the intermediation server 50 using, for example, the PC 90.  Next the specific user registers, via the intermediation server 50, a display name (e.g., "Alice") and a PIN code (e.g., "1234") in the service providing server 100 having the
server name "Server A".  In this case, the intermediation server 50 obtains, from the service providing server 100, an access token (generally called "authentication information"; e.g., "XXXXXXXX") for the specific user.  The intermediation server 50
creates a temporary ID, and sends the temporary ID to the PC 90.  Thereby, the temporary ID is displayed in the PC 90.  The specific user can learn the temporary ID displayed in the PC 90.
<br/><br/> Next, by operating the operation unit 12 of the multi-function device 10, the specific user inputs, into the multi-function device 10, the server name (e.g., "Server A") of the service providing server 100, the display name (e.g., "Alice")
registered in the service providing server 100, and the PIN code (e.g., "1234") registered in the service providing server 100.  Further, by operating the operation unit 12 of the multi-function device 10, the specific user inputs the temporary ID into
the multi-function device 10.  In this case, the multi-function device 10 sends the temporary ID to the intermediation server 50.  Thereby, the intermediation server 50 sends the access token (e.g., "XXXXXXXX") to the multi-function device 10.
<br/><br/> By executing the aforementioned processes, the multi-function device 10 can store information in the display name table 36.  In the above example, the multi-function device 10 stores, in the display name table 36, information in which the
following are associated: the display name (e.g., "Alice") input by the specific user, the server name (e.g., "Server A") input by the specific user, the access token (e.g., "XXXXXXXX") obtained from the intermediation server 50, and the PIN code (e.g.,
"1234") input by the specific user.  Moreover, the specific user can register a display name (e.g., "Alice") and a PIN code (e.g., "3456") in the service providing server 110, as well, in the same manner as above.  In this case, the multi-function device
10 stores new information (e.g., "Alice", "Server B", "ZZZZZZZZ", "3456") in the display name table 36.
<br/><br/> (Processes for Multi-Function Device 10 to Execute Scan UL Function; FIG. 5)
<br/><br/> Next, the contents of processes executed by the devices 10, 50, 100 when the multi-function device 10 is to execute the scan UL function will be described with reference to FIG. 5.
<br/><br/> Although not shown, a display control unit 41 (see FIG. 1) of the multi-function device 10 displays a main screen 300 (see FIG. 8) on the display unit 14 by using main screen information stored in advance in the multi-function device 10.  The
main screen 300 includes a plurality of character strings (e.g., "Internet", "Shortcut", "Copy" etc.) indicating a plurality of functions to be selected by the user.  In case of wanting the multi-function device 10 to execute the scan UL function, the
specific user operates the operation unit 12 to select the character string "Internet" included in the main screen 300.  In this case, a screen information obtaining unit 40 (see FIG. 1) supplies a request R2 to the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the request R2 from the multi-function device 10, the screen information supplying unit 70 (see FIG. 1) of the intermediation server 50 supplies, to the multi-function device 10, server name selection screen information included
in the plurality of screen information 66.
<br/><br/> The screen information obtaining unit 40 of the multi-function device 10 obtains the server name selection screen information from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, the display control unit 41 displays a server name selection screen
302 (see FIG. 8), this being represented by the server name selection screen information, on the display unit 14.  The server name selection screen 302 includes one or more character strings (e.g., "Server A", "Server B") indicating the server names of
the one or more service providing servers 100, 110.  In the present embodiment, the description will proceed using the case, as an example, where the specific user operates the operation unit 12 to select the character string "Server A" (i.e., the server
name of the service providing server 100) included in the server name selection screen 302.  In this case, the screen information obtaining unit 40 supplies a request R4 that includes the character string "Server A" to the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Although not shown, upon obtaining the request R4 from the multi-function device 10, the screen information supplying unit 70 of the intermediation server 50 obtains the display name table 36 from the multi-function device 10.  The screen
information supplying unit 70 identifies, from within the display name table 36, one or more character strings (e.g., "Alice", "Ken") indicating one or more display names associated with the character string "Server A" included in the request R4.  Next,
the screen information supplying unit 70 writes the specified one or more character strings (e.g., "Alice", "Ken") in display name selection screen information included in the plurality of screen information 66.  Then, the screen information supplying
unit 70 supplies, to the multi-function device 10, the display name selection screen information in which the one or more character strings have been written.
<br/><br/> The screen information obtaining unit 40 of the multi-function device 10 obtains the display name selection screen information from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, the display control unit 41 displays, on the display unit 14, a
display name selection screen 304 (see FIG. 8) represented by the display name selection screen information.  The display name selection screen 304 includes one or more character strings (e.g., "Alice", "Ken") indicating one or more display names.  In
the present embodiment, the description will proceed using the case, as an example, where the specific user operates the operation unit 12 to select the character string "Alice" included in the display name selection screen 304.  In this case, the screen
information obtaining unit 40 supplies a request R6 that includes the character string "Alice" to the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the request R6 from the multi-function device 10, the screen information supplying unit 70 of the intermediation server 50 supplies function selection screen information included in the plurality of screen information 66 to the
multi-function device 10.
<br/><br/> The screen information obtaining unit 40 of the multi-function device 10 obtains the function selection screen information from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, the display control unit 41 displays, on the display unit 14, a function
selection screen 306 (see FIG. 8) represented by the function selection screen information.  The function selection screen 306 includes a character string "Scan Upload" indicating the scan UL function and a character string "Download Print" indicating
the DL print function.  Here, the description will proceed using the case, as an example, where the specific user operates the operation unit 12 to select the character string "Scan Upload" included in the function selection screen 306.  In this case,
the screen information obtaining unit 40 supplies a request R8 that includes the character string "Scan Upload" to the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the request R8 from the multi-function device 10, the screen information supplying unit 70 of the intermediation server 50 supplies, to the multi-function device 10, scan setting screen information included in the plurality of
screen information 66.
<br/><br/> The screen information obtaining unit 40 of the multi-function device 10 obtains the scan setting screen information from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, the display control unit 41 displays, on the display unit 14, a scan setting
screen 308 (see FIG. 8) represented by the scan setting screen information.  As described above, the specific user must execute various selections on the plurality of screens 300, 302, 304, 306 until the scan setting screen 308 is displayed on the
display unit 14.  The shortcut function is provided in the multi-function device 10 to reduce this burden on the specific user.  By operating the operation unit 12 to select a "register" button included in the scan setting screen 308, the specific user
can give a shortcut creation instruction to the multi-function device 10.
<br/><br/> When the shortcut creation instruction is given, a data supplying unit 44 (see FIG. 1) of the multi-function device 10 supplies a request R10 to the intermediation server 50.  The request R10 includes the two character strings ("Display
Name=Alice", "Server Name=Server A") selected by the specific user on the two selection screens 302, 304, the two character strings ("Access Token=XXXXXXXX", "PIN Code=1234") stored in association with "Alice" and "Server A" in the display name table 36,
and the one character string ("Screen Name=Scan Setting Screen") indicating the scan setting screen where the shortcut creation instruction was given.  That is, the request R10 includes five character strings in total.  The five character strings may be
included in the request R10 as query information appended to a destination address of the request R10, or included in a body of the request R10.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the request R10 from the multi-function device 10, the code information creating unit 71 of the intermediation server 50 encodes, according to the ID table 68, the five character strings included in the request R10, thereby
creating five code information.  Since the creation of code information has already been described, a detailed description thereof is omitted here.  The five code information include "0105Alice", "02041234", "030201", "0408XXXXXXXX" and "050201".  The
code information creating unit 71 supplies the five code information to the multi-function device 10.
<br/><br/> A code information obtaining unit 45 (see FIG. 1) of the multi-function device 10 obtains the five code information from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, a storage control unit 42 (see FIG. 1) stores, in the memory 34, information
(called "shortcut information" below) in which the following are associated: a name (called "shortcut name SC1" below) that identifies the shortcut of the scan setting screen 308, and the five code information.
<br/><br/> On the other hand, the specific user can operate the operation unit 12 to select, on the scan setting screen 308 (see FIG. 8), various setting items for scanning (scan resolution, file format, size of scan data).  The specific user can operate
the operation unit 12 to select an "OK" button included in the scan setting screen 308.  In this case, the screen information obtaining unit 40 supplies a request R12 to the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the request R12 from the multi-function device 10, the screen information supplying unit 70 of the intermediation server 50 creates an upload URL request according to the first API, and supplies the upload URL request to the
service providing server 100.  The upload URL request is a request for instructing the service providing server 100 to supply, to the intermediation server 50, a URL (i.e., a URL of an upload destination; called "upload URL" below) that indicates a
location within the service providing server 100 where image data created by scanning is to be stored.
<br/><br/> Moreover, as described above, before supplying the display name selection screen information to the multi-function device 10, the intermediation server 50 obtains the display name table 36 from the multi-function device 10.  Consequently, the
intermediation server 50 can identify, from the display name table 36, the access token "XXXXXXXX" associated with the character string "Server A" included in the request R2, and the character string "Alice" included in the request R4.  The
intermediation server 50 causes the service providing server 100 to execute authentication, using the access token "XXXXXXXX", at the stage of supplying the upload URL request to the service providing server 100, or at an earlier stage.  Thereby, the
service providing server 100 can send an appropriate response to the intermediation server 50 in response to the upload URL request supplied from the intermediation server 50.  Moreover, below, a description of the authentication using the access token
is omitted.  However, as required (e.g., each time a request is sent to the service providing server 100), the intermediation server 50 may cause the service providing server 100 to execute authentication using the access token.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the upload URL request, the service providing server 100 supplies the upload URL to the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the upload URL from the service providing server 100, the screen information supplying unit 70 of the intermediation server 50 supplies, to the multi-function device 10, the upload URL and scan performing screen information
included in the plurality of screen information 66.
<br/><br/> The screen information obtaining unit 40 of the multi-function device 10 obtains the scan performing screen information from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, the display control unit 41 displays, on the display unit 14, a scan
performing screen 310 (see FIG. 8) represented by the scan performing screen information.  Thereby, the specific user can learn that the scan UL function is being executed.  Further, upon obtaining the upload URL from the intermediation server 50, the
control unit 30 causes the scan performing unit 20 to scan a document.  Next, the control unit 30 supplies an upload request R14, this including the upload URL obtained from the intermediation server 50 and the image data created by the scan performing
unit 20, to the service providing server 100 without intermediating through the intermediation server 50.  In the present embodiment, the upload request R14 is communicated without intermediating through the intermediation server 50, and therefore
private images of the specific user can be prevented from being transmitted through the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the upload request R14, the service providing server 100 stores the image data included in the upload request R14 in a location indicated by the upload URL included in the upload request R14.  Thereby, the processes related to the
scan UL function end.
<br/><br/> (Processes for Multi-Function Device 10 to Execute DL Print Function; FIG. 6)
<br/><br/> Next, the contents of processes executed by the devices 10, 50, 100 when the multi-function device 10 is to execute the DL print function will be described with reference to FIG. 6.  Moreover, the processes executed by the devices 10, 50, 100
until the function selection screen 306 is displayed on the display unit 14 of the multi-function device 10 are the same as the processes of FIG. 5.
<br/><br/> The specific user operates the operation unit 12 to select a character string "Download Print" included in the function selection screen 306 (see FIG. 8).  In this case, the screen information obtaining unit 40 supplies, to the intermediation
server 50, a request R20 that includes the character string "Download Print".
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the request R20 from the multi-function device 10, the screen information supplying unit 70 of the intermediation server 50 creates, according to the first API, a folder name list request, and supplies the folder name list request
to the service providing server 100.  The folder name list request is a request for instructing the service providing server 100 to supply, to the intermediation server 50, a folder name list that indicates one or more folder names storing the image data
uploaded by the specific user (i.e., the display name "Alice").
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the folder name list request, the service providing server 100 supplies the folder name list to the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the folder name list from the service providing server 100, the screen information supplying unit 70 of the intermediation server 50 writes, in folder selection screen information included in the plurality of screen information
66, one or more character strings (e.g., "F1", "F2") indicating one or more folder names included in the folder name list.  Then, the screen information supplying unit 70 supplies the folder selection screen information, in which the one or more
character strings have been written, to the multi-function device 10.
<br/><br/> The screen information obtaining unit 40 of the multi-function device 10 obtains the folder selection screen information from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, the display control unit 41 displays, on the display unit 14, a folder
selection screen 312 (see FIG. 8) represented by the folder selection screen information.  By operating the operation unit 12 to select a "register" button included in the folder selection screen 312, the specific user can give a shortcut creation
instruction to the multi-function device 10.
<br/><br/> When the shortcut creation instruction from the specific user has been given, the data supplying unit 44 of the multi-function device 10 supplies a request R22 to the intermediation server 50.  Moreover, as with the request R10 of FIG. 5, the
request R22 includes five character strings.  However, instead of the character string "Screen Name=Scan Setting Screen", the request R22 includes the character string ("Screen Name=Folder Selection Screen") indicating the folder selection screen given
by the shortcut creation instruction.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the request R22 from the multi-function device 10, the code information creating unit 71 of the intermediation server 50 creates five code information, as in the case of FIG. 5.  However, since the character string "Screen
Name=Folder Selection Screen" is included in the request R22 in the case of FIG. 6, the code information creating unit 71 creates code information "050202" instead of the code information "050201".  The code information creating unit 71 supplies the five
code information to the multi-function device 10.
<br/><br/> The code information obtaining unit 45 of the multi-function device 10 obtains the five code information from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, the storage control unit 42 stores, in the memory 34, information (called "shortcut
information" below) in which the following are associated: a name (called "shortcut name SC2" below) that identifies the shortcut of the folder selection screen 312, and the five code information.
<br/><br/> On the other hand, the specific user can operate the operation unit 12 to select one character string (e.g., "F1") included in the folder selection screen 312 (see FIG. 8).  In this case, the screen information obtaining unit 40 supplies, to the
intermediation server 50, a request R24 that includes one character string (e.g., "F1") selected by the specific user.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the request R24 from the multi-function device 10, the screen information supplying unit 70 of the intermediation server 50 creates a thumbnail URL request according to the first API, and supplies the thumbnail URL request to the
service providing server 100.  The thumbnail URL request is a request for instructing the service providing server 100 to supply, to the intermediation server 50, URLs (called "one or more thumbnail URLs" below) of one or more thumbnail image data
corresponding to one or more image data being stored in the folder indicated by the character string (e.g., "F1") included in the request R24.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the thumbnail URL request, the service providing server 100 supplies one or more thumbnail URLs to the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the one or more thumbnail URLs from the service providing server 100, the screen information supplying unit 70 of the intermediation server 50 supplies, to the multi-function device 10, the one or more thumbnail URLs and thumbnail
selection screen information included in the plurality of screen information 66.
<br/><br/> The screen information obtaining unit 40 of the multi-function device 10 obtains the one or more thumbnail URLs and the thumbnail selection screen information from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, the control unit 30 supplies a
thumbnail request R26 that includes the one or more thumbnail URLs to the service providing server 100 without intermediating through the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the thumbnail request R26, the service providing server 100 supplies one or more thumbnail image data, these being stored at a location indicated by the one or more thumbnail URLs included in the thumbnail request R26, to the
multi-function device 10 without intermediating through the intermediation server 50.  In the present embodiment, the thumbnail image data is communicated without intermediating through the intermediation server 50, and therefore private images of the
specific user can be prevented from being transmitted through the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the one or more thumbnail image data from the service providing server 100, the display control unit 41 of the multi-function device 10 combines the one or more thumbnail image data in the thumbnail selection screen information. 
The display control unit 41 displays, on the display unit 14, a thumbnail selection screen 314 (see FIG. 8) represented by the thumbnail selection screen information in which the one or more thumbnail image data have been combined.  The specific user can
operate the operation unit 12 to select one thumbnail image included in the thumbnail selection screen 314.  In this case, the control unit 30 supplies, to the intermediation server 50, a request R28 that includes one image ID (called "specific image ID"
below) for identifying the one thumbnail image selected by the specific user.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the request R28 from the multi-function device 10, the screen information supplying unit 70 of the intermediation server 50 creates, according to the first API, a download URL request that includes the specific image ID, and
supplies the download URL request to the service providing server 100.  The download URL request is a request for instructing the service providing server 100 to supply, to the intermediation server 50, a URL (i.e., a URL of a download source; called
"download URL" below) that indicates a location within the service providing server 100 where source image data of the thumbnail image data representing the thumbnail image specified by the specific image ID is being stored.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the download URL request, the service providing server 100 supplies the download URL to the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the download URL from the service providing server 100, the screen information supplying unit 70 of the intermediation server 50 supplies, to the multi-function device 10, the download URL and print performing screen information
included in the plurality of screen information 66.
<br/><br/> The screen information obtaining unit 40 of the multi-function device 10 obtains the print performing screen information from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, the display control unit 41 displays, on the display unit 14, a print
performing screen 316 (see FIG. 8) represented by the print performing screen information.  Thereby, the specific user can learn that the DL print function is being executed.  Further, upon obtaining the download URL from the intermediation server 50,
the control unit 30 supplies a download request R30 that includes the download URL to the service providing server 100 without intermediating through the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the download request R30, the service providing server 100 supplies image data, which is being stored in the location indicated by the download URL included in the download request R30, to the multi-function device 10 without
intermediating through the intermediation server 50.  In the present embodiment, the image data is communicated without intermediating through the intermediation server 50, and therefore private images of the specific user can be prevented from being
transmitted through the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the image data from the service providing server 100, the control unit 30 of the multi-function device 10 causes the print performing unit 18 to print an image represented by the image data.  Thereby, processes related to the DL
print function end.
<br/><br/> (Processes in Case Shortcut is Selected; FIG. 7)
<br/><br/> Next, the contents of processes executed by the devices 10, 50, 100 when the specific user selects the shortcut information (see FIG. 5 and FIG. 6) that is being stored in the memory 34 of the multi-function device 10 will be described with
reference to FIG. 7.
<br/><br/> Although not shown, the specific user operates the operation unit 12 to select a character string "Shortcut" included in the main screen 300.  In this case, the display control unit 41 displays a shortcut selection screen 320 (see FIG. 8) on the
display unit 14 by using shortcut selection screen information that was pre-stored in the multi-function device 10.  The shortcut selection screen 320 includes character strings (e.g., "SC1", "SC2" etc.) indicating shortcut names included in the shortcut
information that is being stored in the memory 34.  The specific user can operate the operation unit 12 to select the character string "SC1" included in the shortcut selection screen 320.  In this case, a request sending unit 46 (see FIG. 1) sends a
request R40 that includes a predetermined URL (a URL that was pre-registered in the multi-function device 10) to the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon receiving the request R40 from the multi-function device 10, the control unit 60 of the intermediation server 50 sends a read instruction to the multi-function device 10.
<br/><br/> An instruction receiving unit 47 (see FIG. 1) of the multi-function device 10 receives the read instruction from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, a code information supplying unit 43 reads, from the memory 34, the five code
information (see FIG. 5) associated with the character string "SC1" selected by the specific user.  The code information supplying unit 43 supplies a request R42 that includes the five code information to the intermediation server 50.  As described
above, when communication of the request R40 and the read instruction is executed between the multi-function device 10 and the intermediation server 50, the multi-function device 10 can appropriately supply the request R42 that includes the five code
information to the intermediation server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the request R42 from the multi-function device 10, the screen information supplying unit 70 of the intermediation server 50 creates, according to the ID table 68, five character strings (i.e., reproduces five character strings)
from the five code information included in the request R42.  In this case, although not shown, the intermediation server 50, e.g., obtains the display name table 36 from the multi-function device 10, and can determine whether the information included in
the display name table 36 matches the created character strings ("Display Name=Alice", "Server Name=Server A", "PIN code=1234", "Access Token=XXXXXXXX").  In case of a negative judgement here, the intermediation server 50 need not execute the subsequent
processes (i.e., supply of the scan setting screen information).
<br/><br/> Based on the created five character strings, the screen information supplying unit 70 can learn which screen information the multi-function device 10 is requesting.  That is, in this example, the five character strings include "Server
Name=Server A" and "Screen Name=Scan Setting Screen", and consequently the screen information supplying unit 70 can learn that the multi-function device 10 is requesting scan setting screen information for the service providing server 100.  Consequently,
the screen information supplying unit 70 supplies the scan setting screen information to the multi-function device 10.
<br/><br/> The screen information obtaining unit 40 of the multi-function device 10 obtains the scan setting screen information from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, the display control unit 41 displays, on the display unit 14, the scan setting
screen 308 (see FIG. 8) represented by the scan setting screen information.  The subsequent processes are the same as the processes of FIG. 5.
<br/><br/> On the other hand, the specific user can operate the operation unit 12 to select the character string "SC2" included in the shortcut selection screen 320.  In this case, in the same manner as described above, the request sending unit 46 sends a
request R50 that includes a predetermined URL to the intermediation server 50, and the instruction receiving unit 47 receives a read instruction from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, the code information supplying unit 43 reads, from the
memory 34, the five code information (see FIG. 6) associated with the character string "SC2" selected by the specific user.  The code information supplying unit 43 supplies a request R52 that includes the five code information to the intermediation
server 50.
<br/><br/> Upon obtaining the request R52 from the multi-function device 10, the screen information supplying unit 70 of the intermediation server 50 reproduces the five character strings according to the ID table 68.  Thereby, based on the five character
strings, the screen information supplying unit 70 can learn the folder selection screen information which the multi-function device 10 is requesting.  As in FIG. 6, the screen information supplying unit 70 obtains the folder name list from the service
providing server 100, and supplies the folder selection screen information to the multi-function device 10.
<br/><br/> The screen information obtaining unit 40 of the multi-function device 10 obtains the folder selection screen information from the intermediation server 50.  In this case, the display control unit 41 displays, on the display unit 14, the folder
selection screen 312 (see FIG. 8) represented by the folder selection screen information.  The subsequent processes are the same as the processes of FIG. 6.
<br/><br/>Effects of the Present Embodiment
<br/><br/> According to the present embodiment, the multi-function device 10 can display the scan setting screen 308 and the folder selection screen 312 (see FIG. 8) on the display unit 14 by using a shortcut.  Further, in case an instruction to create a
shortcut is given by the specific user, the multi-function device 10 needs only to store code information (e.g., "0105Alice"), which has a comparatively small data size, in the memory 34, and does not need to store character strings (e.g., "Display
Name=Alice"), which have a comparatively large data size, in the memory 34.  Consequently, the data size to be stored in the memory 34 can be reduced.  In particular, the storage capacity of the memory 34 of the multi-function device 10 is smaller than
that of a PC, etc. Consequently, the technique of the present embodiment can be applied effectively to a device having a comparatively small storage capacity, such as the multi-function device 10.
<br/><br/> Further, in the present embodiment, in case an instruction to create a shortcut is given by the specific user, the intermediation server 50 creates the code information, and supplies the code information to the multi-function device 10. 
Consequently, programs (e.g., the ID table 68, etc.) for creating the code information do not need to be stored in the multi-function device 10, allowing the amount of programs the multi-function device 10 must store to be reduced.  Further, in case an
instruction to select a shortcut is given by the specific user, the intermediation server 50 can obtain the code information from the multi-function device 10 and create (i.e., reproduce) the character strings from the code information.  Thereby, based
on the character strings, the intermediation server 50 can supply appropriate screen information to the multi-function device 10.
<br/><br/> (Corresponding Relationships)
<br/><br/> The multi-function device 10 and the intermediation server 50 are respectively examples of the "function executing device" and the "server".  Moreover, both the print function and scan function are an example of the "specific function".  The
scan setting screen 308 and the server name selection screen 302 are respectively examples of the "first screen" and the "second screen".  Selection of the "register" button included in the scan setting screen 308, and selection of the character string
indicating one shortcut name included in the shortcut selection screen 320 are respectively examples of the "creation instruction" and the "selection instruction".  The five character strings (e.g., "Display Name=Mice") shown in FIG. 5 and the five code
information (e.g., "0105Alice") shown in FIG. 5 are respectively examples of the "two or more character strings" and the "two or more code information".  Further, the ID table 68 is an example of the "association information".
<br/><br/> (Variant 1)
<br/><br/> The "function executing device" is not limited to the multi-function device 10 that is capable of executing both the print function and scan function, but may be a printer capable of executing only the print function, or may be a scanner capable
of executing only the scan function.  Generally speaking, the "function executing device" may be any device capable of executing a specific function, which may include the print function, the scan function, or the combination thereof.
<br/><br/> (Variant 2)
<br/><br/> In the above embodiment, the storage control unit 42 stores five code information corresponding to the five character strings in the memory 34.  Instead, the storage control unit 42 may store fewer than five code information in the memory 34. 
For example, the storage control unit 42 may store only two code information in the memory 34, these including the code information "030201" corresponding to the server name and the code information "050201" corresponding to the screen.  In this type of
variant, also, when the two code information are supplied to the intermediation server 50 from the multi-function device 10, the screen information supplying unit 70 can learn which screen the multi-function device 10 desires.  Further, the storage
control unit 42 may store only another two code information (e.g., the code information corresponding to the screen and the code information corresponding to the access token) in the memory 34.  Generally speaking, the "storage control unit" may be any
unit that stores two or more code information in the device-side memory.  Similarly, the "two or more character strings" may include any combination of two or more character strings from among a character string relating to the name of the server (e.g.,
"Server Name=Server A"), a character string relating to the authentication information (e.g., "Access Token=XXXXXXXX"), and a character string relating to the name of the first screen (e.g., "Screen Name=Scan Setting Display").
<br/><br/> (Variant 3)
<br/><br/> In the above embodiment, in case the creation instruction for creating a shortcut is given, the code information creating unit 71 of the intermediation server 50 creates the code information from the character strings obtained from the
multi-function device 10, and supplies the code information to the multi-function device 10.  Instead, in case the creation instruction for creating a shortcut is given, the control unit of the multi-function device 10 may create the code information
from the character strings, and the storage control unit 42 may store the code information created by the control unit of the multi-function device 10 in the memory 34.  Generally speaking, the "two or more code information" may be created by the server,
or may be created by the function executing device.
<br/><br/> (Variant 4)
<br/><br/> In the above embodiment, a shortcut is created in the case where the "register" button on the scan setting screen 308 is selected after the screens 302 to 306 have been displayed sequentially.  Instead, e.g., the main screen 300 may further
include a specific character string for instructing a shortcut to be created.  The specific user may select character strings from the screens 302 to 306 after the specific character string included in the main screen 300 has been selected (i.e., after
the shortcut creation instruction has been given).  When the character string "Scan Upload" included in the function selection screen 306 is selected, the data supplying unit 44 may supply the five character strings to the intermediation server 50, the
code information obtaining unit 45 may obtain the five code information from the intermediation server 50, and the storage control unit 42 may store the five code information in the memory 34.  Generally speaking, the shortcut creation instruction may be
given after the first screen and second screen have been displayed, as in the above embodiment, or may be given before the first screen and second screen are displayed, as in the present variant.
<br/><br/> (Variant 5)
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 7, in the above embodiment, in case the selection instruction for selecting a shortcut is given, communication of the request R40 and the read instruction is executed between the multi-function device 10 and the intermediation
server 50, and then the code information supplying unit 43 reads the code information in the memory 34.  Instead, in case the selection instruction for selecting a shortcut is given, the code information supplying unit 43 may read the code information in
the memory 34 and supply the code information to the intermediation server 50 without the communication of the request R40 and the read instruction being executed.
<br/><br/> (Variant 6)
<br/><br/> In the above embodiments, the functions of the units 40 to 47, 70 to 71 are realized by the CPUs 32, 62 of the multi-function device 10 and the intermediation server 50 executing processes according to software.  Instead, at least a part of the
functions of the units 40 to 47, 70 to 71 may be realized by hardware such as a logic circuit, etc.
