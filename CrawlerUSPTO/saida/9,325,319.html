<br/><br/> Over the past, there have been many types of communication systems and methods.  Unfortunately, they have been inadequate for various applications.  More specifically, the CMLs of existing communication systems are often inadequate.  Therefore,
improved systems and methods are desired.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention is directed to data communication systems and methods.  More specifically, embodiments of the present invention provide a CML that uses one or more equalization modules to apply equalization via secondary windings of
transformers that are coupled, directly or indirectly, to the CML outputs.  An equalization modules includes a DAC component that generates switching signals based on control signals received from an external equalization module.  The equalization module
also includes switchable resistors and/or capacitors.  The switching signals are used to select the switchable resistors and/or capacitors.  By switching resistors and/or capacitors at the equalization module, the outputs of the CML are equalized.  There
are other embodiments as well.
<br/><br/> Current mode logic, as mentioned above, has a wide range of applications.  Among other features, CML provides fast operation and low power consumption, which makes it suitable for high-speed communication.  For low-power and high-speed
communication systems, such as optical communication network, CML can be used as a part of a device interface.  In addition to being used in optical networks, CMLs have been used in various type of video links, such as HDMI, DVI, and others.
<br/><br/> Used as buffers, CMLs have been implemented in tapered buffer chains, serializer-deserializer (SerDes) circuits, clock and data recover (CDR), multiplexers, and many others.  With relatively low voltage swings, compared to static CMOS circuits,
CML provides high-speed operation that is important for interface and communication applications.  For example, CML can operates at a speed well over 200 Mbit/s.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a simplified diagram illustrating connecting CML to a pair of communication line.  For example, a set of differential lines is provided between the source 101 and the destination 102.  A voltage Vcc of the CML is coupled to both of the
differential lines respectively via resistors.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a simplified diagram illustrating a convention CML.  As shown in FIG. 2, a pair of differential inputs Vin_P 206 and Vin_N 205 are respectively coupled to a pair of CMOS devices.  A variable impedance module 207 controls a bank of
capacitors and/or resistors gates.  For example, by varying capacitor and/or resistor values, the source voltages of CMOS transistors can be changed, thus altering output voltages.  However, as explained below, changing capacitance of the impedance
module 207 would also cause a shift in peaking frequency.  As shown, the outputs pair Vout_P 203 and Vout_N 204 are respectively coupled to resistors 201 and 202.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, a CML is typically coupled to communication lines with
resistors.
<br/><br/> CMLs, as mentioned above, is often used in communication lines.  For example, many SerDes transceivers utilize CMLs as a part of the transmission line.  Similar to other types of communication devices, Serdes transceivers often need to use one
or more equalizers to compensate channel attenuation (loss).  More specifically, equalization is often needed to compensate high frequency losses in communication channels.  By using equalization techniques to compensate channel attenuation, effective
channel length can be increased and communication channel reliability improved.  Preferably, equalization technique can be adjustable to compensate channels with different levels of attenuation.  For example, equalization adjustment may be manual or
automatic.  For example, various types of linear and adaptive equalization techniques have been used.  Often, automatic adjustment is referred to as "adaptive equalization".  In communication systems and SerDes, various types of linear and adaptive
equalization techniques have been used.
<br/><br/> An important aspect of providing equalization is applying equalization to communication channels.  Among other things, designing a high bandwidth high gain EQ is challenging.  Various equalization designs come with their power and/or area
penalties.  For example, a common approach involves adding inductors for gain peaking, but unfortunately this approach can only provide a fixed level of equalization, and it comes with a significant area penalty.  In some conventional systems,
equalization is provide by amplifiers with controllable degeneration and inductive gain peaking, and this approach provides controllable levels of equalization, but unfortunately adds significant power and area penalties.
<br/><br/> It is to thus to be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention provide CMLs that are capable of applying adjustable equalization.  Among other things, by applying equalization through CMLs, energy efficient and high performance
equalization can be achieved.  For example, CMLs equalization can be applied without incurring a large amount of power consumption.  As described below, CMLs according to embodiments of the present invention comprise one or more transformers on their
respective load stages, and these transformers function as tuned bandwidth boosters.  It is to be appreciated that controlling the peaking of the inductor from the secondary winding reduces the component parasitic and power consumption.  With
transformer(s) as a load to CMLs, continuous time linear equalization (CTLE) can be applied.  CMLs according to embodiments of the present invention are described in further details below.

<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is simplified diagram illustrating a CML according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize
many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  A current mode logic device 300, as shown in FIG. 3, includes a first input 315 (Vin_p) and a second input 316 (Vin_n) for receiving data.  For example, the first input 315 and the second 316 are coupled
to a pair of data transmission lines.  The first input 315 and the second input 316 are respectively coupled to the gates of transistors 307 and 316.  It is to be understood that while MOS devices are shown as transistors, other types of transistor
devices may be used as well, such as bipolar junction transistor (BJT) devices uses in early implementation of CMLs, and other types of transistor devices.  While operating under similar operating principles, MOS or CMOS devices are preferred over BJT
devices for their high speed and low voltage.  Each of the transistors 307 and 316 comprises a drain terminal and a source terminal.  The drain terminals of the transistors 307 and the 316 respectively provide a first output (Vout_n) 310 and a second
output (Vout_p) 308.  The outputs 310 and 308, as can be seen in FIG. 3, are configured in series with resistors and transformers, and thus the output voltages are affected by the characteristics (e.g., resistance and inductance) of the resistors and
transformers.  The source terminals of the transistors 307 and 316 are grounded via transistors 312 and 313, which are controlled by the bias voltage 314.  Source resistor 321 and adjustable capacitance 320 are configured in parallel, and are
respectively coupled to the source terminals of the transistors 307 and 309.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 3, output 310 is coupled to resistor 303 and transformer 304 in series; output 308 is coupled to the resistor 306 and transformer 305 in series.  Through the resistors and transformers, outputs 310 and 308 are connected to the
high potential V.sub.DD.  Therefore, the voltage swing of the outputs 310 and 308 is a function of the high potential V.sub.DD and the resistors and the transformers.  Additionally, voltage swing is affected by the tail current I.sub.SS coupled to the
source terminals of the transistors 315 and 316.  The inductances of the transformers 304 and 305 can be adjusted by equalization modules 302 and/or 303.  In FIG. 3, the resistors 303 and 306 are directly coupled to the outputs 310 and 308, and the
transformers 304 and 305 are coupled to the outputs via these resistors.  It is to be appreciated that, depending on the implementation, the configuration of resistors, transformers, and outputs may be changed.  For example, transformer 304 and the
resistor 303 may switch their places, where the resistor 303 is directly coupled to the high potential V.sub.DD, and transformer 304 is directly coupled to the output 310 and the configured in series with the resistor 303.  There can be other variations
as well.
<br/><br/> Transformers 304 and 305 are characterized by adjustable inductance values.  When the inductance values of the transformers 304 and 305 are changed, the voltages of the outputs 310 and 308 change correspondingly.  Transformers 304 and 305,
implemented in conjunction with equalizer modules 302 and 301, allow equalization to be applied to the outputs 310 and 308.  Depending on the specific implementation, one or more equalization modules are used.  In FIG. 3, transformers 304 and 305 are
respectively connected to two different equalizer modules.  In a specific implementation, only transformer 304 is connected to the equalizer module 302, and transformer 305 is not connected to an equalizer module.  In another implementation, only
transformer 305 is connected to the equalizer module 301, and transformer 304 is not connected to an equalizer module.  It is to be appreciated that other variations as possible as well.
<br/><br/> Each of the transformers comprises a primary winding and a secondary winding.  The equalization modules are coupled to the transformers via the secondary windings of the transformers.  For example, the equalizer module 302 is coupled to the
secondary winding of the transformer 304, and the equalizer module 301 is coupled to the secondary winding of the transformer 305.  By changing electrical characteristics (e.g., resistance and/or capacitance) of the equalizer modules, the inductances of
the transformers can be changed, which in turn changes the output voltages.  For example, the transformers act substantially as an adjustable load that affects the data outputs of the CMLs.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 4A and 4B are simplified diagrams illustrating equalizer modules according to embodiments of the present invention.  These diagrams merely provide an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in
the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown in FIG. 4A, a bank of resistors is switched by n control bits provided by a DAC module.  The DAC module is connected to an equalization logic.  For example, the
equalization logic can be a DFE or other types of adaptive equalization logic.  Based on the signals from the equalization logic, one or more of the resistors are turned on.  As shown in FIG. 4B, a bank of capacitors is switched by n control bits
provided by a DAC module.  Based on the signals from the equalization logic, one or more of the capacitors are turned on.  In certain embodiments, an equalization module may include both capacitors and resistors that are selectively switched by one or
more DAC modules.  In various implementations, the equalization logic may be adaptive equalizer (e.g., DFE equalizer), linear equalizer, and/or other types of equalizers.  As explained above, the equalization modules and transformers described according
to embodiments of the present invention allow equalization to be applied at CMLs, and they can be used in conjunction with different equalization systems and methods.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, the resistor and capacitor values are predetermined and/or calibrated based on the equalization needs.  More specifically, the resistor and capacitor values and the corresponding switching by the DAC is set based on the
peaking required for the equalizer.  In a specific embodiment, the DAC is 5-bits (e.g., 2.sup.5=32 steps) and covers a range of 16 dB of peaking, at a step of 0.5 dB.  Depending on the implementation, DAC at different resolution may be used.  For
example, for an equalization scheme that requires fine tuning equalization amount, an 8-bit DAC (i.e., capable of 2.sup.8=256 steps) may be used; for an equalization scheme that requires small device area and low power consumption, a 3-bit (i.e., capable
of 2.sup.3=8 steps) DAC can be used.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments according to the present invention, an equalization module utilizes both resistors and capacitors, and the DAC is programmed to selected predetermined combinations of resistor and capacitor.  For example, for high-speed
boost change, the equalization module switches only capacitors.
<br/><br/> Now referring back to FIG. 3.  As shown, equalization modules applies equalization via the secondary windings (i.e., secondary paths) of the transformers, not directly to the outputs or the data path.  Consequently, component parasitic and power
consumption attributing to the equalization module are minimized.  In addition, the transformers 304 and 305 substantially eliminate the need for switched inductors, which are typically expensive in power and area.
<br/><br/> The source terminals of the transistors 307 and 309 are respectively coupled to transistors 313 and 312 as shown.  Transistors 313 and 312 as shown are independently biased by a bias voltage V.sub.BIAS, which is electrically coupled to their
respective gate terminals.  Resistor 321 and the capacitor module 320 are configured in series and electrically coupled to the source terminals of transistors 307 and 309.  Resistor 321 and the capacitor module 320 are associated with the tail currents
coming out of the transistors 307 and 309.  The electrical properties of resistor 321 and the capacitor module 320 consequently affect the magnitude of the tail currents, which in turn affect the voltage swing magnitude.  The capacitor module 320
provides an adjustable capacitance.  For example, the capacitor module 320 is implemented according to FIG. 4B, where a bank of capacitors is switched by n control bits provided by a DAC module.  Based on the signals from the equalization logic, one or
more of the capacitors are turned on.  By changing the capacitance of the capacitor module 320, the CML outputs 308 and 310 can be changed as well.  In various embodiments, the change of capacitance of the capacitor module 320 is coordinated with
equalization module 302 and/or equalization module 301.  For example, selection of capacitors and/or resistors of equalization modules is coordinated against the selection of capacitors at the capacitor module 320, wherein capacitors and resistors values
are predetermined and matched accordingly.  By changing both inductance coupled to the outputs and capacitance coupled to the tail currents, the system is capable of adjusting the output voltage levels without causing a shift in frequency.
<br/><br/> It is to be appreciated that the CMLs according to embodiments of the present invention can provide equalization at specific target peaking frequencies.  FIG. 5 is a simplified diagram illustrating equalization applied to an output data line. 
This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown in graph 501, by increasing capacitance, peaking is
increased, but at the same time the peaking is shifted to a lower frequency.  For example, if the original signal is at a capacitance C3, by increasing capacitance to C2, peaking is increased, and frequency is shifted lower; by further increasing
capacitance to C1, peaking is further increased, and frequency is further lowered.  For example, frequency shift shown in graph 501 may occur when the capacitor module 320 shown in FIG. 3 is used alone to change the peaking magnitude.
<br/><br/> Changing inductance also affect both peaking and frequency.  As shown in graph 502, when inductance is increased from L3 to L2, both peaking and frequency are increased, and when inductance is increased to L1, both peaking and frequency are
further increased.  For example, frequency shift shown in graph 502 may occur when equalization modules 301 and/or 302 alone, without adjusting the capacitor module 320, are used to change the peaking magnitude.
<br/><br/> For the purpose of applying equalization, frequency shift is undesirable.  It is thus to be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention allow equalization to be applied without shifting frequency, as shown in graph 503.  As can be seen
in graph 503, by adjusting both capacitance (through capacitor module coupled to the source terminals of the transistors) and inductance (through transformers coupled to the drain terminals of the transistors), the changes in peaking magnitude can be
adjusted without causing frequency shift.  For example, when the DAC is at a value of [0], the peaking magnitude is relatively low; however, when DAC is at value [1] or [n], which correspond to different combinations of the capacitors and/or resistors
being selected, the corresponding peaking magnitudes are increased, but the peaking frequencies stayed the same.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a graph illustrating simulation of applying equalization at different settings of an equalization module according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope
of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As can be seen in FIG. 6, at different equalization peaking values (e.g., from 0 to about 15 dB), peaking frequencies stay centred.  For
example, both the capacitor module coupled to the tail current and the equalization module coupled to the output are adjusted to provide equalization without shifting the peaking frequency.
<br/><br/> While the above is a full description of the specific embodiments, various modifications, alternative constructions and equivalents may be used.  Therefore, the above description and illustrations should not be taken as limiting the scope of the
present invention which is defined by the appended claims.
