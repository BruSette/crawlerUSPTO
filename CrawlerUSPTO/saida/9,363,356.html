<br/><br/> The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent
     Application Ser. No. 61/788,523, which was filed on Mar. 15, 2013, by
     Jack Colletti for a SYSTEM AND METHODS TO ENABLE THE EFFICIENT AND
     INTERACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, TO ENABLE COMMUNICATIONS-BASED
     RECOMMENDATIONS, AND TO REDUCE DISTRACTED DRIVING and is hereby
     incorporated by reference.
         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method for manipulating graphical user interface (GUI) objects that represent communication media messages, the GUI objects displayed on a display of a data processing
system, the method comprising: a) receiving messages from multiple message originators via two or more message services including a telephone message service and including at least one of a short message service (SMS) and an electronic mail (e-mail)
message service, the messages including an originator identifier (ID);  b) generating a plurality of call elements, with each call element representing a particular message and sender profile information associated with the originator ID for the
particular message;  c) generating a visual element for each of the call elements;  d) displaying a plurality of available queues on the display, the display of each available queue including one or more of the visual elements in each queue as a GUI
object;  and e) in response to an input received via a user interface, moving a selected one of the visual elements to a new queue;  f) via the user interface, accepting an input indicating that a selected queue is to be processed in a defined sequence; 
and g) processing the selected queue by initiating return communications for the call elements in the defined sequence.

<br/><br/> 1.  Technical Field
<br/><br/> This disclosure relates generally to the field of communications.  In some embodiments, it relates to a system and method for building of one or more interactive queues used in communications, such as phone calls, SMS text messages, electronic
voice messages, and other communications and/or messaging systems.
<br/><br/> 2.  Background Information
<br/><br/> Despite the rise of social media technologies, the basic need to connect live (e.g. people talking to people) remains a critical element of business and other interactions.  Surprisingly, no significant improvements have been made to the way
that people actually talk live.  For people that derive income from such communications, (e.g. sales managers, business executives, agents, consultants, real estate agents, etc), the need to connect with others live is critical.  History has shown us
that email and other social applications can be useful, but can not (and most likely will not) replace the basic process of one person communicating live with another individual.
<br/><br/> Also, though "smart phones" are now pervasive and have many features (e.g. cameras, music, games) and applications, when it comes to placing, scheduling and managing calls, a user has very limited choices.  Specifically, a user can make a call,
receive a call, and listen to voicemails.  Some smart phones now have "visual voicemail", which allows a user to see the time/date/caller details of a voicemail.  However, when it comes to the personal telecom/calling process, users are essentially no
better off then they were 25 years ago.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> An individual may experience a wide range of problems or inefficiencies associated with live communications.  Some examples include: not properly following up on incoming calls; losing track of who to call back and when; forgetting to regularly
touch base with top clients; double or triple booking conference calls as result of poor calendar management; poor management of sales prospecting calls; and taking personal calls during work hours.
<br/><br/> Because these stated problems can be very expensive for individuals and businesses, I have determined that it would be useful to have a solution that enabled an individual the ability to more efficiently and cost effectively manage calls and
other incoming/outgoing communications.
<br/><br/> Specifically the system and methods include the following.
<br/><br/> A system and/or method that allows a user to efficiently manage communications by using one or more interactive queues.  In one implementation, the system and/or method includes a unique Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the easy management or
scheduling of communications.  The GUI can be manipulated via a wide variety of common internet enabled devices such the iPhone, Droid smart phone or interactive devices such as a tablet PC, interactive television, in-car telematics system, etc.
<br/><br/> The following related methods are further discussed: Method for assigning communications media to one or more queues.  Method for automating the handling of communications media.  Method for sequential or random dialing of contacts in a
user-defined or system-defined queue.  Method for improving communications efficacy by enabling workflow and notifications between contacts.  Method for improving follow-ups with contacts.  Method for presenting commerce-based recommendations or other
customized recommendations to a user based on that user's specific communications.  Method for signaling "open/available" status to contacts and subsequent handling of communication.  Method to reduce distracted driving via game-based or incentive
systems. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT
<br/><br/> Definitions.
<br/><br/> "Workflow" is a commonly known term and is defined in the Business Dictionary (www.businessdictionary.com) as a progression of steps (tasks, events, interactions) that comprise a work process, involve two or more persons, and create or add value
to the organization's activities.  In a sequential workflow, each step is dependent on occurrence of the previous step; in a parallel workflow, two or more steps can occur concurrently.
<br/><br/> "Communications" may include a plurality of electronic or telecom related items, including but not limited to phone calls, voicemails, Short Message Service (SMS) messages (a.k.a.  text messages), electronic mail (email), et al.
<br/><br/> System Architecture
<br/><br/> As depicted in FIG. 1a, the System [100] is primary comprised of a Services Tier [110] and a Client Tier [120].  The Services tier contains a series of computer programs that execute processes for the management of media, data, calls, or any
combination thereof.  In one embodiment, the Services tier interacts with an interactive telephony service for the processing of telephone calls and related data.  It may also interact with other message services such as email, short message services,
and the like (not shown in FIG. 1a).  The Services Tier may also maintain certain information in a Queue Database [150].
<br/><br/> The Client tier presents results to users via standard media devices such as smart phones, tablet PCs, in-car telematics systems, internet-enabled televisions, etc.
<br/><br/> A standard internet/web server [130] may connect the Services and Client tier.
<br/><br/> User Interface
<br/><br/> The system [100] also provides computer-based program that handles communications and displays them to the user in a unique graphical user interface (GUI).
<br/><br/> FIG. 1b is a screen capture of a representative GUI and is further explained in FIG. 1c.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1c illustrates one embodiment of the GUI [130].  The system [100] may implement the GUI to enable the user to view and manipulate (via the internet, a mobile/smart phone, or other interactive device) in the client tier [120] an incoming
stream [131] of communications media [132], including phone, SMS, email, or other messages.  The system may identify a plurality of incoming and outgoing communications, each identified by certain information [134] relating to the sender/originator of a
message including (but not limited to) the sender's phone number and/or certain additional profile information, which may be based on a user's existing photo and profile or integrated information obtained from widely available social media sites such as
<b><i>Facebook,</i></b> LinkedIn, Twitter, et al. or contact management sites such as Plaxo et al. More specific methods related to this system follow.
<br/><br/> Method for Assigning Communications Media to One or More Queues.
<br/><br/> The intent of this method is to enable more efficient management of common interactive communications.  For most users, there exists a high degree of waste and inefficiency associated with managing multiple streams of incoming communications
media (e.g. telephone calls, SMS messages, emails, voicemails, et al).
<br/><br/> In general terms, the method enables a user to manage these communications through the use of queues.
<br/><br/> Representative Example: In one example shown in FIG. 1c, once a communication is received by the system [100], the system allows the user the ability to manually move a "call element" to a default or user-defined queue in queue database [150]. 
For example, the user named Jack may assign a call [144] from his brother to his "Jack's Family" queue [135].  In another example, the user may assign or move an incoming SMS message [145] from his co-worker to his "Work" queue [133].  The system gives
the user the choice of leaving the elements in their initially assigned queues, or the user can take a number of other specific actions.  For example, the system allows the user the ability to select a number of options, including (but not limited to)
initiating a return call, sending a SMS to the caller, or sending an email.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2a illustrates the system overview, where this specific queue assignment method is accomplished via a Communications engine [200] that processes both User preferences [201] and Contact data [202].  Specifically, as communications media are
received by the system [100], an internal process creates a visual Element ("element") that has specific data properties and attributes.  Further, this visual element can be moved by the User to one or more queues.  When this action is taken, a series of
computer processes/events take place in the Queue Engine [206].  For example, this engine records and processes the state, status, and attributes of all contacts.  The engine also enables the presentation [207] of elements in one or more queues [208].
<br/><br/> FIG. 2b illustrates how an incoming media element [210] which is present in the incoming stream [211] can be displayed using the GUI on a touch-sensitive client tier [120] device and moved [212] via a commonly known touch gesture such as a
swipe/drag (or similar) method (using fingers, stylus, a computer mouse, et al.) to its intended position [213].  In another embodiment, communications media may be automatically assigned to Queues based on system or user defined preferences.
<br/><br/> Method for Automating the Handling of Communications Media.
<br/><br/> The system fosters the automatic assignment of incoming communications (calls, emails, SMS, or other), based on user preferences and contact attributes, to one or more queues.
<br/><br/> In general terms, the method enables a user to manage many forms of incoming communications in an automated fashion.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3a illustrates a typical example.  When a call or SMS is received [301] from an existing contact (ie.  that is known to the system), the system will process or take action on the element as per the default settings, as per the contact's
attributes, or as per user-defined preferences.  In this example, the system places a call element from a contact that has previously been tagged "VIP" into the user's "Critical" queue [302].  The user will then receive notifications [303] (e.g. a SMS or
system message) such as a reminder that there are a certain number of items in the critical queue.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3b illustrates an example of handling new calls received [310] from contacts that are unknown to the user.  The system gives the user the ability to set a preference that automatically directs [311] the call elements to the user's "hold"
queue, or the system can automatically forward the element to another user (for example an admin or co-worker), or request the unknown contact to further identify themselves [312].
<br/><br/> Representative examples of automatic queue assignment rules include: contact in the user's contact list; contact has been flagged by user as a VIP; contact has a high approval rating; contact was called by user x times in the past y days, etc.
<br/><br/> Method for Sequential or Random Dialing of Contacts in a User-Defined or System-Defined Queue.
<br/><br/> The intent of this method is to enhance the user's ability to efficiently communicate with a series of contacts in a given period of time.  Specifically, the method enables the automatic, sequential, or random dialing of multiple contacts in a
user-defined queue or default (system defined) queue.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4a illustrates a system view of this method, which involves a "Dialer Process" [400] that integrates with the User Engine [401], the Contacts Engine [402] and the Queue Engine [403].  The Dialer process uses standard telephony to establish
telephonic connection between the User and each contact.  When contacts are manipulated/placed in the User Interface [404] in user-defined or system-defined Queues [405], the User may choose to connect with each of multiple contacts in a sequential (e.g.
alphabetic, visually apparent, numerical, et al.) or random manner.  Again, all results rely directly on user preferences [406] and/or contacts preferences/characteristcs [407].
<br/><br/> FIG. 4b illustrates an example workflow.  In this example, a user has placed ten (10) contacts into a selected "Customer-1" queue [410].  The "placing" can be done manually, or by other system-driven means.  When the user starts a dialing
process [411], the system will begin the calling sequence.  Specifically, the system will dial (using standard internet telephony [412], [413], [414], [415], etc.) through the contacts in the queue in the exact order that the user specified.  Likewise,
the user can start the call sequence at the beginning of the queue, or at any place in the queue.
<br/><br/> This method gives the user the ability to choose to work through all calls, pause, resume, or exit.  For example, the user may want to pause [416] part of the way through a calling sequence (ie.  after contact #5 in the example of 10 contacts in
the queue).  The user can then resume calling, or choose to exit the queue.  At this point, contacts that have not been called will remain in the queue.
<br/><br/> A related feature in this method (not shown in the drawings) enables the user to randomly dial through the list of contacts in the queue.  For example, user may choose her "Friday" queue, which contains seven (7) contacts.  When the user selects
"start queue", the system will randomly dial through all 7 contacts and then end.  In one embodiment, this can be accomplished by the Dialer Engine using standard randomizer algorithm to set a sequence for the calling.
<br/><br/> In another example, the user may want to quickly work through all calls in the incoming calls queue.  In this example, the user has fifteen (15) calls in her incoming calls queue.  The user can simply select "call queue" and the system will
start calling those contacts in the order received, by name (alphabetically), or via some other system or user-defined rules.
<br/><br/> As in the case of auto-dialing method, a rules/preferences engine is used to establish the type/mode of calling and includes both system (default) and/or user-defined rules.
<br/><br/> Method for Improving Communications Efficacy by Enabling Workflow and Notifications Between Contacts.
<br/><br/> The intent of this specific method is to solve the problem and waste associated with scheduling phone communications between two or more parties.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5a illustrates the system view of this method, which involves a "Workflow Handler" [500] that integrates with the User Engine [501], the Contacts Engine [502] and the Queue Engine [503].  The Workflow Handler processes the status and state
of Contacts in one or more queues that the User defines (recall from FIG. 1b the user may customize the names of these queues as "Work", "Personal", "VIP", etc.).
<br/><br/> During a typical calling process, the workflow handler can be used to verify that contacts are available for an incoming call.  If the User enables this preference, all contacts in a specific queue will receive a notification (via SMS, email, or
other) that they can expect an incoming communication (e.g. phone call, email, SMS, et al) from the user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5b illustrates a typical process flow.  In this example, a user notices ten (10) contacts in his "High Priority" queue [510].  He decides to place calls to these contacts and will use the system's auto-dialing feature (ie.  a process by
which all calls will be contacted in the order in the queue).  Before he starts the process, he wishes to notify each contact that he is starting the call sequence.  He selects "Notify and Call" [512] whereupon the system sends an SMS or email (again
based on user preference) to each contact in the queue to notify them [514].  The contacts, upon receiving the notification, can elect to (1) do nothing or (2) acknowledge the communication with a one of several possible responses.  In one case, a
contact in the Priority queue may simply signal that she acknowledges that the call is coming and is standing by [515].  In another example, a different contact may signal that they are not currently available to take a call [516].  In this case, the
system will remove the contact from the active queue, or the system will "mute" the call (in other words the system will skip over this contact, but it will remain in the active queue).  Both scenarios are dependent upon the preferences and settings that
the user has specified in his user settings.
<br/><br/> At each point in the process, and on a real-time basis, the queue in question is updated with the state and status of contacts based on their inputs/responses to data.  For example, the queue that started with 10 contacts may end up with only 5
at [520] since the contacts have signaled "not available" when first contacted.  In one embodiment, the 5 contacts that opted out may be moved to a "hold" queue, or back to their initial position.  In other embodiments, the queues can be automatically
prioritized by assigning relative weights to contacts of the same type.  Again, all scenarios are dependent on User preferences.
<br/><br/> Once the queue is updated based on these responses, the user can begin contacting calls in sequence [521], [522], or request that any missed contacts be tried again [523], [531].
<br/><br/> Method for Improving Follow-Ups with Contacts.
<br/><br/> The intent of this specific method is to improve the process associated with keeping in touch with, or following up with contacts (be they business, personal, or other).
<br/><br/> FIG. 6a illustrates a system view of this method, which involves a "Follow-up Handler" [600] that integrates with the User Engine [601], the Contacts Engine [602] and the Queue Engine [603].
<br/><br/> The Followup-Handler processes User preferences [604] with the status and characteristics of Contacts [605] associated with the User, and the presence of those contacts in the User's queues [606].  When the User manually changes the status of a
contact by moving it from one queue to another (as previously illustrated in FIG. 2b), or when the status of the contact moves to a queue by automated method, the Followup handler process runs and may take a variety of specific actions.
<br/><br/> Specifically, the Follow-up Handler reacts to the User preferences for specific contacts, or for specific queues.  For example, a user may specify that no contact in the user's "VIP-Client" queue should ever go "untended" for more than 5 days
[note: as a matter of definition, the term "untended" implies that no call or SMS has been made to the contact in a certain timeframe (ie.  has not been followed-up with)]. Further, the user may specify that any contact with aging over 5 days will
automatically (1) be highlighted with a flag, (2) placed in the user's Incoming queue, and (3) SMS and/or email reminder notifications are sent reminding the user to take action on these contacts.  In another example, the user can specify that all
contacts with "customer" flag (set by the user) should receive a call on the last Friday of each month at 11 am EST. In this case, when this specific anniversary arrives, contacts meeting this profile (ie.  flagged as customers) will be added to the
specified queue for calling or other communication.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6b is a process flow that illustrates aspects of the example above.
<br/><br/> Here, the user has set a seven-day aging limit for the VIP queue [611].  A contact from "Ted" is placed in a VIP queue [612] and remains unattended to for 7 days [613].  The Follow-up Handler places the Ted contact in the active queue [614] so
that contact is initiated [615].
<br/><br/> Method for Presenting Commerce-Based Recommendations or Other Customized Recommendations to a User Based on that User's Specific Communications.
<br/><br/> This method enables recommendations to a user based on user's communications activity.  In one embodiment, the recommendations may be commerce based.  In another embodiment, the recommendations may be related to other content such as, but not
limited to, news or events or travel/map related information.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 illustrates this specific method is a recommendation engine ("engine") [700] that interfaces with a user engine [701] and a vendor engine [702] to display customized results to the user.  The recommendation engine utilizes key user
preference data, which may include specific attributes from the user's communications history [703] or location history [704] (or combination thereof).  In one embodiment, the engine may process the user's call history as a source, in another embodiment
the engine may process the user's SMS (text) history as a source.  In still another embodiment, the engine may process the user's native GPS information as a source.  In yet another embodiment, the engine may use any combination of the aforementioned
sources (eg.  call history, GPS information, and SMS history).
<br/><br/> The content resulting suggestions may be presented by the system in a number of ways, including but not limited to email, text, or voice [706].  The resulting suggestions may be read or processed by the user in a number of ways [706] including
but not limited to PC, smart phone, tablet, interactive television, vehicle-based information system, et al.
<br/><br/> Representative example: In a specific time period (say 5 days) a user has made 10 calls to the 619 area code (San Diego area) and has also received 13 SMS texts from contacts in that same area code.  The system stores and analyzes this data and
the suggestion engine processes this data and makes recommendations to the user.  One such recommendation could be restaurants or hotels in the San Diego area that are having upcoming specials or deals.  Another suggestion could be related to travel
plans (air, hotel, car rental etc) or to events like upcoming concerts in the San Diego area, or tickets to the San Diego zoo.
<br/><br/> In another example, a user places a call to a friend in New York City.  The system recognizes that the user is driving (based on GPS info) and makes a suggestion based on these elements.  One suggestion may be "I see you are driving; do you need
a map to this location that you are calling?" Another suggestion may be "You may want to take an alternate route; looks like traffic is heavy ahead." Again, these suggestions may be presented to the user in a number of ways, including email, SMS, voice
command, etc.
<br/><br/> Method for Signaling "Open/Available" Status to Contacts and Subsequent Handling of Communication.
<br/><br/> The intent of this specific method is to solve the problem and waste associated with communicating with contacts.  This method is somewhat analogous to "office hours" where people (mostly in business or academia) establish set hours that their
door is open for employees to come by and talk.  The difference here is that the system is leveraging the communications technology.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 illustrates how the specific method is accomplished, via a Status Handler [800] that processes user preferences [801] and contact preferences [802] to display results.  Specifically, if the "open" feature is enabled, the status handler
notifies specific contacts or social media applications per the User preferences and then waits for a call or communication.
<br/><br/> Similarly, if the feature is disabled, the handler notifies specific contacts or social media applications.
<br/><br/> See FIGS. 8b and 8c for an exemplary high-level system diagram and process flows.
<br/><br/> Representative examples: In one scenario, the User knows that he will be driving for 5 hours from city A to city B. He wishes to signal to certain contacts that he is open and available to take incoming calls [810].  On his mobile device, he
enables this feature, placing himself in "open" status.  At this point, the status handler notifies [811] certain contacts that may get a SMS or email notification that the User is open for calls.  Once notified, those people initiate contact [812].
<br/><br/> In another related scenario, the User may broadcast his Open status via common social media tools such as Twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Linkedin, et al. See FIG. 8b steps [821], [822], [823].
<br/><br/> Method to Reduce Distracted Driving via Game-Based or Incentive Systems.
<br/><br/> The intent of this specific method is to reduce distracted driving by implementing a game or incentive system.
<br/><br/> The specific method is accomplished by a "Game Process" that takes into account the users's location (and other preferences) and tracks the number of incoming and outgoing communications while the mode is enabled.
<br/><br/> Representative example: A traveler is driving from Pittsburgh to Washington, DC (about 275 miles and a 5 hour drive).  At the beginning of the trip, the driver sets her phone in "safe driving" mode.  At this point, the system calculates the time
and geo location of the driver.  During the drive to DC, the driver receives 6 incoming calls.  Since the system is in "safe driving" mode, the driver does not receive phone calls.  Instead, the application is processing total miles, calls "avoided", and
other usage data to arrive at a total score.  In one embodiment, a score may be: User Score=D.times.MC.times.PF
<br/><br/> Where D=total distance driven/travelled; MC=total number of missed/avoided calls while driving, and PF=is a penalty factor (represented by a percentage) that reduces the score for instances of using the phone while driving (e.g. using SMS or
making/receiving calls).
<br/><br/> In the example above, the traveler would receive a score of 275.times.6.times.1=1,650.  This score can then be shared/broadcasted via typical social media sites such as Twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> et al. Over time, users can redeem their safe driving
points at participating retail outlets.  Ultimately, the combination of gaming, points, and vendor participation may incentivize more drivers to focus more on driving and less on the smart phone.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the system may require "check ins" at points along the way to prevent user's gaming the system.  The system would synthesize the distance/time and GPS information provided by the mobile device with the user's check-ins to
calculate the user's true travel activity.
<br/><br/> It should be understood that the example embodiments described above may be implemented in many different ways.  In some instances, the various data processors, engines, servers, and the like described herein may each be implemented by a
physical or virtual general purpose computer having a central processor, memory, disk or other mass storage, communication interface(s), input/output (I/O) device(s), and other peripherals.  The general purpose computer is transformed into the processors
and executes the processes described above, for example, by loading software instructions into the processor, and then causing execution of the instructions to carry out the functions described.
<br/><br/> As is known in the art, such a computer may contain a system bus, where a bus is a set of hardware lines used for data transfer among the components of a computer or processing system.  The bus or busses are essentially shared conduit(s) that
connect different elements of the computer system (e.g., processor, disk storage, memory, input/output ports, network ports, etc.) that enables the transfer of information between the elements.  One or more central processor units are attached to the
system bus and provide for the execution of computer instructions.  Also attached to system bus are typically I/O device interfaces for connecting various input and output devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, displays, printers, speakers, etc.) to the
computer.  Network interface(s) allow the computer to connect to various other devices attached to a network.  Memory provides volatile storage for computer software instructions and data used to implement an embodiment.  Disk or other mass storage
provides non-volatile storage for computer software instructions and data used to implement, for example, the various procedures described herein.
<br/><br/> Embodiments may therefore typically be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or any combination thereof.  The computers that execute the processes described above also may be deployed in a cloud computing arrangement that makes available
one or more physical and/or virtual data processing machines via a convenient, on-demand network access model to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services).
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, the procedures, devices, and processes described herein are a computer program product, including a computer readable medium (e.g., a removable storage medium such as one or more DVD-ROM's, CD-ROM's, diskettes, tapes,
etc.) that provides at least a portion of the software instructions for the system.  Such a computer program product can be installed by any suitable software installation procedure, as is well known in the art.  In another embodiment, at least a portion
of the software instructions may also be downloaded over a cable, communication and/or wireless connection.
<br/><br/> Embodiments may also be implemented as instructions stored on a non-transient machine-readable medium, which may be read and executed by one or more procedures.  A non-transient machine-readable medium may include any mechanism for storing or
transmitting information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a computing device).  For example, a non-transient machine-readable medium may include read only memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); magnetic disk storage media; optical storage media;
flash memory devices; and others.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, firmware, software, routines, or instructions may be described herein as performing certain actions and/or functions.  However, it should be appreciated that such descriptions contained herein are merely for convenience and that
such actions in fact result from computing devices, processors, controllers, or other devices executing the firmware, software, routines, instructions, etc.
<br/><br/> It also should be understood that the system block and process flow diagrams may include more or fewer elements, be arranged differently, or be represented differently.  But it further should be understood that certain implementations may
dictate the diagrams illustrating the execution of the embodiments be implemented in a particular way.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, further embodiments may also be implemented in a variety of computer architectures, physical, virtual, cloud computers, and/or some combination thereof, and thus the computer systems described herein are intended for purposes of
illustration only and not as a limitation of the embodiments.
<br/><br/> While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to example embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from
the scope of the invention encompassed by the appended claims.
