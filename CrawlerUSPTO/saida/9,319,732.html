     about Multimedia Content," filed May 3, 2011. The subject matter of the
     foregoing is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A computer-implemented method for sharing video between members of an existing Internet-based social network service (SNS), the method comprising: sharing a discussion
thread about a video between member(s) of an existing Internet-based social network, the discussion thread containing comments attached to video bookmarks that mark time points during the video, the marked time points corresponding to the comments, the
video bookmark including a thumbnail of a frame of the video from the marked time point, the video provided to the members by a video source, and the video bookmarks maintained by a metadata service;  and in response to a member activating a video
bookmark, causing the video source to play the video for the member from the time point corresponding to the video bookmark;  and wherein the metadata service is operated by an entity different than entities operating the social network service and the
video source.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1 wherein the discussion thread further comprises SNS profile information attached to comments in a manner that attributes the comments to members.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1 wherein the discussion thread further comprises bibliographic information about the video.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 1 further comprising: organizing the discussion thread by the members making the comments.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 1 further comprising: organizing the discussion thread by the members receiving the comments.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 1 further comprising: organizing the discussion thread according to content of the comments.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 1 further comprising: organizing the discussion thread by video bookmark.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 1 further comprising: organizing the discussion thread by level of recommendation of the comments.
<br/><br/> 9.  The method of claim 1 further comprising: presenting to the members of the social network service, information concerning member comments about the video.
<br/><br/> 10.  The method of claim 9 wherein said information relates to the volume of comments attached to different time points in the video.
<br/><br/> 11.  The method of claim 9 wherein said information relates to the volume of comments made by different members of the social network service.
<br/><br/> 12.  The method of claim 9 wherein said information relates to a content of the comments.
<br/><br/> 13.  The method of claim 1 further comprising: aggregating and organizing discussion threads for many videos into a comment-based video guide;  and publishing the video guide.
<br/><br/> 14.  The method of claim 1 wherein at least one member activates video bookmarks from one device and views the video on a different device.
<br/><br/> 15.  The method of claim 1 wherein a format of the video changes depending on the device used to view the video.
<br/><br/> 16.  The method of claim 1 wherein the existing Internet-based social network service is <b><i>Facebook</i></b>.
<br/><br/> 17.  The method of claim 1 wherein the existing Internet-based social network service is Twitter.
<br/><br/> 18.  The method of claim 1 wherein the comment is an instant message.
<br/><br/> 19.  A computer program product for use with a computer, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer usable medium having a computer program code embodied therein for sharing video between members of an existing
Internet-based social network service (SNS), the computer program code performing the steps of: sharing a discussion thread about a video between member(s) of an existing Internet-based social network, the discussion thread containing comments attached
to video bookmarks that mark time points during the video, the marked time points corresponding to the comments, the video bookmark including a thumbnail of a frame of the video from the marked time point, the video provided to the members by a video
source, and the video bookmarks maintained by a metadata service;  and in response to a member activating a video bookmark, causing the video source to play the video for the member from the time point corresponding to the video bookmark;  and wherein
the metadata service is operated by an entity different than entities operating the social network service and the video source. <hr/> <center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> 1.  Field of the Invention
<br/><br/> This invention relates generally to sharing personal information about multimedia content, including for example using other people's comments about videos as a basis for a personalized program guide to videos.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of the Related Art
<br/><br/> For many years, television was the dominant form of easily accessible multimedia.  As such, it often formed the center of social activities.  In the early days of television when not every household contained a television, multiple households
might meet at a certain time at a certain place (the place with the television) in order for everyone to watch a certain television program.  This behavior was driven by technological constraints.  There was only one television and the television program
could only be viewed at one specific time determined by the broadcaster.
<br/><br/> Advances in technology have essentially removed these constraints.  Televisions are now so inexpensive as to be ubiquitous and programming can be viewed on many devices, not just televisions.  Furthermore, time-shifting technologies now allow
broadcast programming to be recorded and viewed at any later time.  Many other types of programming can simply be accessed at any time.  Today, it is not uncommon for every person to have personal gadgets for accessing and viewing many different types of
multimedia content, not just television, at all times.  Thus, it is not uncommon for members of today's household to all be in the same room, but with each member viewing his/her own program on his/her own device.  This is in stark contrast to the
behavior from long ago.  Thus, one might conclude that the behavior of sharing a video-viewing experience is now obsolete, since advances in technology have removed the constraints that in the past forced this behavior.
<br/><br/> However, the technological constraints were only one aspect driving the behavior.  People often enjoy gathering together to share a video experience.  For example, shared viewing experiences happen today, even though they are not forced by
technological limitations.  A group of friends or floormates within a college dormitory might meet regularly to watch a weekly television series.  As another example, sports fans might gather at a local sports bar in order to cheer on their favorite
team.  This happens not because there is only one television that must be shared; it happens because people enjoy sharing the experience.
<br/><br/> However, it is difficult to reproduce a similar experience for people who are connected virtually.  Returning to the household example, the daughter might be watching a different program than her parents and siblings, but she might be watching
the same program as her friends across town (who are also watching on their devices from their homes) and she might enjoy sharing that experience even though she cannot physically meet with her friends.  Thus, there is a need for technology to allow
people to do so.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention overcomes the limitations of the prior art by allowing members of a social network service to share real-time comments about multimedia content they are viewing.  The comments are attached to bookmarks, which can be used by
other members to view the video and add to the discussion thread.
<br/><br/> In one aspect, the following occurs in real-time as member(s) are viewing multimedia content.  The viewing members can share their comments about the video with other members, including those who are not viewing the content.  The sharing
includes bookmarks that mark corresponding time points in the content.  Thus, if one member makes a comment about scene 14, his comment is shared with a bookmark for scene 14.  Other members can use the bookmark to start viewing the content or to jump to
different points in the content if they are already viewing.  In this way, members can share the experience of viewing the content without having to be in the same physical location.
<br/><br/> The comments and bookmarks preferably are organized into discussion threads.  The discussion threads can be saved and then used for subsequent searching.  Thus, they can form a sort of personalized program guide.  Rather than looking at the
electronic program guide provided by the local cable company, a member might search through the comments and recommendations made by his friends.  In another aspect, anonymized or aggregated information (including trending data) is published to a wider
audience.
<br/><br/> Other aspects of the invention include methods, devices and systems related to the approaches described above, as well as specific implementations of the foregoing. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> The figures and the following description relate to preferred embodiments by way of illustration only.  It should be noted that from the following discussion, alternative embodiments of the structures and methods disclosed herein will be readily
recognized as viable alternatives that may be employed without departing from the principles of what is claimed.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a block diagram a system according to the present invention.  In FIG. 1, a member 110A of a social network service (SNS 120) is viewing multimedia content 130 from source 140.  For example, the member 110A might be watching a broadcast
television program.  While the member 110A is viewing the content 130, he makes comments 150A about the content 130.  He might like or dislike certain parts; he might notice things about the scenery, plot or characters; he could make any types of
comments.  These comments 150A are shared with other members 110B-N according to the privacy rules for the SNS.  The dashed lines in FIG. 1 indicate members of the SNS 120.
<br/><br/> However, the comments 150A are not simply forwarded to other members.  Rather, the comments 150A are attached to bookmarks that mark corresponding time points in the content 130.  For example, the bookmarks might be thumbnails of the
corresponding frames in the television program.  The bookmarks can come from different sources.  For example, they might be provided by the source 140 along with the content 130.  Alternately, they might be generated by the member's viewing device as he
is viewing the content 130.  In another approach, the bookmarks might be provided by a separate service 160.  This bookmarking service may also be referred to as a dynamic metadata service, because it can provide and/or organize metadata beyond just
bookmarks.  The comments and bookmarks (collectively, referred to as a discussion thread 152A) are forwarded to other members 110B-N.
<br/><br/> Upon viewing the comments, other members 110B-N may want to also view the content 130.  If they are already viewing the content, they may want to skip to the sequence that was commented on.  In either case, they can do so by activating the
bookmark.  In FIG. 1A, member 110B activates the bookmark.  This triggers a sequence of events 170A-C. The metadata service 160 translates the bookmark to a corresponding time point for the content 130.  It instructs 170B the source 140 to provide 170C
the content 130 to member 110B beginning at that time point.  Members 110B-N can also provide their own comments and share them with the other members.  In this way, members 110 can have a shared viewing experience, even if each member is viewing the
content 130 on his/her own device at separate physical locations.
<br/><br/> In another aspect, the comments and corresponding bookmarks can be organized into discussion threads for the video.  Metadata service 160 stores these discussion threads for subsequent searching by members of the SNS.  For example, member 110B
might later want to view member 110A's comments about the video, or might want to search for related videos based on member 110A's comments.  Public parts of the discussion thread (including aggregate statistics over many members) may also be published
more broadly and/or used for searching by a broader public.  In this way, a program guide to content can be constructed based on personal comments.
<br/><br/> It should be understood that FIG. 1 is just an example and many variations will be apparent.  For example, there are many types of multimedia content 130 and many ways to distribute that content.  Video is probably the most common form of
multimedia content, but other forms can also be accommodated.  Video can include live action (sporting events, musical performances, etc.), movies and television programming.  It can include live broadcast, broadcast premieres, video on demand and
playback of prerecorded video.  Distribution channels can include television broadcast, cable and satellite networks, Internet and mobile networks.  Accordingly, the source 140 can include television stations, cable and satellite head-ends, Internet
sites and a member's local device (e.g., for content that is downloaded onto a member's device and then played back later).
<br/><br/> The actual devices used can also vary, even from member to member.  First, the device used to view content, activate video bookmarks and share comments could be the same device, but they do not have to be.  For example, a member might be
watching a television program on his high definition TV but might be social networking via his mobile device (e.g., phone, tablet, pad), with the two activities synchronized.  On the other hand, another member might be watching the television program and
social networking from a single integrated window running on his laptop computer.  Viewing devices include devices supported by the content source 140, including televisions, computers and phones and other mobile devices.  Similarly, social networking
devices include devices supported by the SNS 120.  Common social networking services include <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, and other forms of instant messaging.
<br/><br/> As a final example, the functions provided by the member devices 110, source 140, SNS 120 and metadata service 160 can be allocated in different ways.  As described above, the bookmarks can be provided by any of these devices.  As another
example, rather than notifying 170B the source 140 to start playback of content for a member 110B, the metadata service 160 might initiate playback by sending a message to the member 110B which then gets the appropriate content from the source 140.  With
respect to SNS 120, the SNS 120 is the source of privacy rules for the members 110, so communications between the members 110 and source 140 or service 160 could run through the SNS 120 rather than occurring directly.  Conversely, SNS functions such as
privacy controls could be implemented at least in part by the source 140 or service 160.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 2-4 provide a more detailed example of one implementation.  In FIG. 2, a member is commenting on a video he is viewing.  In this example, the member is viewing a video on one device 210 and is social networking on another device 220.  The
video is a live broadcast of an event that is being streamed to the device 210.  There is one video bookmark 230 for each second of content.  The video bookmarks 230 are provided to the SNS device 220.  The bookmarks 230 and video are synchronized.  That
is, the video bookmark for second 303 is provided to the SNS device 220 at the same time that second 303 is playing on the content device 210.  The member can share comments 240 via various SNS.  The comments are attached to the video bookmarks
(annotated as VMark in FIG. 2).  The comments (with VMarks) are shared with other members, who can then also view the video by activating the bookmarks.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates the organization of comments.  Comments 240 are received by the metadata service 160.  The service 160 associates the comments 240 with the corresponding time point in the video.  In this example, comments are further
aggregated by scene 330.  For example, seconds 300 to 360 in the video might all correspond to scene 13.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 shows an example organization of this information for scene 13.  Sections 460 and 470 contain non-personal metadata about the show.  These items could include title, summary, year of release, actors, sex/language/violence rating, video
source and other bibliographic information.  This can be provided for the entire video or might vary from scene to scene.  Actor information could list just the actors appearing in that scene.  Other scene information could include setting and background
music.
<br/><br/> Section 480 includes comments organized for this scene.  This data includes personal data such as the actual comments and responses and SNS profile for the commenters.  It can also include data that has been anonymized or aggregated so that it
can be published to a broader audience.  In this example, metadata service 160 organizes, stores and makes this data 480 available to others.  Thus, SNS 120 might access the metadata service 160 in order to share comments within groups of members, and
more public search engines might catalog the public parts of this data to provide more general searching.  In this way, the data collected by metadata service 160 can provide a guide to different types of programming--a personalized program guide of
sorts.  As shown in FIG. 4, the data preferably is provided in different forms matched to the member's device.
<br/><br/> By searching, sorting and reviewing the metadata attached to a scene or a video, a member can learn more about the scene or video and decide whether to view it.  For example, a member might search for comments from certain members or a group of
members (e.g., his friends) and review these comments to learn about the video.  The metadata can be searched or organized in different ways: according to which member is making the comment, according to which members are receiving the comments,
according to which members are/have viewed the video, according to content of the comments, by video bookmark, or by level of recommendation (e.g., like/dislike), to name a few.  If a member selects a video, he can then add his own comments to the
discussion thread.  In this way, a rich data set can be built up over time.
<br/><br/> Various architectures can be used to implement a metadata service on a computer system.  For example see U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,624,337 "System and Method for Indexing, Searching, Identifying and Editing Portions of Electronic Multimedia Files" and
U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,548,565 "Method and Apparatus for Fast Metadata Generation, Delivery and Access for Live Broadcast Program," both of which are incorporated herein by reference.  In one implementation, specialized software applications run on the
various devices to implement the video bookmarking and integrated social networking services.  In one approach, these applications are provided by a central source.  Alternately, APIs may be defined, thus allowing third parties to develop many different
versions of these applications.  Preferably, the user experience is somewhat standardized so that users can easily use these applications, regardless of which device and which version of the application.  In one approach, the metadata service controls
and distributes the APIs.
<br/><br/> Aggregate data or time-based data can also be presented.  For example, trending information might indicate that certain groups of members feel a television show is getting better/worse with each passing episode, or that certain sections within a
movie are exciting/boring.  Trend setters can use the service to establish followings for new programs.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 5-9 show screen shots of another implementation.  In this example, a member is watching a television program on his television, from broadcast TV station KBS2.  At the same time, the member is social networking on a separate mobile device. FIG. 5 is a screen shot of the member's SNS device.  The channel choice 510 shows which channel the member is tuned to on his television.  In this example, there are two possible channels, KBS1 and KBS2, and the user is watching KBS2.  The video bookmark
520 is the bookmark that corresponds to what is currently airing on KBS2.  It changes as the television program proceeds.  Section 530 shows a history of video bookmarks, showing the current bookmark as well as past bookmarks.  In this way, the member
can make comments on prior scenes by scrolling back to past bookmarks.
<br/><br/> The member can share comments by clicking the sharing arrow 540.  FIG. 6 shows the screen after the sharing arrow 540 has been activated.  This version of software brings up possible SNS services (Twitter, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> and SMS), to make it easy for
the member to share the video bookmark 520.  The member can also make comments before sharing the bookmark.  The "TV on" button can be used to turn on the TV, for example tuning it to the broadcasting channel or start playing recorded/stored video
according to the current video bookmark.
<br/><br/> The List button 550 in FIG. 5 displays a list of past comments.  FIG. 7 shows the screen after the List button is clicked.  In this particular display, each entry in the list includes a comment 710, the corresponding bookmark 540, and the SNS
profile 720 of the member making the comment.  By activating the bookmark 540, the member can bring up more information and eventually start playback of the corresponding video.  FIG. 8 shows the screen after a member has activated bookmark 540.  In this
example, the comment 710 and SNS profile 720 are displayed.  Some additional information is provided about the program, as well as about the social networking aspects as shown at the bottom of this screen.  In this example, there have been 203 tweets or
retweets of this comment, 145 <b><i>facebook</i></b> comments or like/dislike actions, and 82 sms (short message service) messages using this video bookmark.  These are generally showing quick social media statistics about the video bookmarks.  Video playback can be
started by clicking the Play triangle 810.  The playback preferably is matched to the member's playback device.  For example, different screen formats and resolutions might be used for playback on a high definition TV versus a small screen mobile phone. 
In fact, the playback does not have to be video.  For example, it could be teletext.  If the video is a newscast, the member might prefer teletext rather than full video.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 shows a sharing dashboard.  The SNS counts 910 show the number of messages or mentions shared about the video or video bookmark within the same video by Twitter friends (tweets), <b><i>Facebook</i></b> friends (<b><i>facebook</i></b>), or by friends' SMS or MMS
(sms).  The Friend's count (Friends) shows the count of the unique users' or friends' IDs in the SNS shared count.  The Peak Time Chart 920 has two graphs that show the SNS shared counts (top) and SNS Friend's count (bottom) vs.  time lapsed from the
beginning of the video.  The Best row 930 indicates which time point is considered the best by the community (e.g., the most shared scene within the video).  The thumbnail is the video bookmark for the best time point, and the numbers indicate the total
messages or mentions by each SNS (tweet, <b><i>facebook,</i></b> and sms).  The Person row 940 indicates the SNS ID whose video bookmarks or messages are used most by other friends by retweets (RT) or video playback counts (Share).  This could be used for rewarding
for those who actively send video bookmarks for example.  The Said row 950 indicates which words are occurring most frequently in the members' comments.  These keywords are saved as metadata and can be used for search and linking dynamic advertising.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 shows another example implemented on an Internet-ready TV.  In this example, a television program is playing on the TV.  However, the TV has a user interface button 1010.  When activated, the button overlays a sharing dashboard 1020. 
The listing of member comments is located at the bottom of the dashboard.  The other information is similar to information shown in FIGS. 5-9.  In an alternate implementation, the user interface button is not shown on the TV screen, but might be a button
on a remote control for example.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 illustrates distribution of a video bookmark, with playback on different devices.  In this example, a user creates a video bookmark, which can be activated for playback on a mobile device 1110, on a web browser on a personal computer
1120, or on a television 1130.  In response to clicking the video bookmark, the video bookmark service leads the user to the corresponding source that has the right format for the user's desired device of video playback.  For example, mobile servers may
have multimedia files optimized for mobile screens, and TV or PC servers may have a multimedia files for high resolution HDTVs.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 illustrates use of video bookmarks to synchronize playback on different devices.  In this example, a user activates a video bookmark to start playback on a television 1210.  Since his device is a television 1210, the bookmarking service
uses an appropriate format for the content, which in this example is MP4, 1 Mbps streaming.  The user stops the playback at some point, which is marked by the video bookmark 1215.  The user then resumes playback, but from the laptop 1210 in his room. 
The bookmarking service knows where to resume playback, based on video bookmark 1215, and uses a different format (flash, 500 Kbps streaming) more suited for the laptop 1220.  The user again stops the playback, at a position marked by video bookmark
1225.  Playback is resumed on a mobile device 1230 using an appropriate format (MP4 H.264, 300 Kbps).  In this manner, video bookmarks can be used to place-shift, time-shift and/or device-shift the playback of content.
<br/><br/> Although the detailed description contains many specifics, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but merely as illustrating different examples and aspects of the invention.  It should be appreciated that the scope
of the invention includes other embodiments not discussed in detail above.  For example, the video bookmark may take different forms and contain different amounts of information.  In one example, video bookmark itself may contain the actual text from the
video.  This is especially useful for news segments.  When users cannot access the SNS or video source, they can read the text contained in the video bookmark.  TV stations sends out such text information during broadcasting via teletext format and the
metadata service can capture the text and attach it to the video bookmarks automatically.  This view of text can also generate rapid viral spread of the message/bookmarks, which in turn can generate more video playbacks--i.e. enhance rating of the video.
<br/><br/> In another aspect, the video bookmark or the metadata service may be used to change the programming channel.  As an example, in a situation where a user is watching video on a TV and social networking on a mobile device, activating a video
bookmark on the mobile device may automatically change the channel on the TV to the selected program.  The video bookmark may also be used to locate the multimedia file within locally connected home consumer electronics devices such as a DVR (Digital
Video Recorder) or NAS (Network Attached Storage), to retransmit or broadcast certain comments to a broader audience (e.g., a producer, actor/actress, or reporter of certain video may want to let a broad audience know about their content prior to
broadcasting or afterwards to increase both real-time and time-shifted ratings), or to use certain thread/comments in related advertising commercials.  In alternate embodiments, the pointer to the multimedia content could be solely the web address or
location of the video (i.e., without thumbnail and additional other information).  The pointer or video bookmark could also point to a short video clip or other intermediate content, which in turn leads to the full multimedia content.
<br/><br/> Various other modifications, changes and variations which will be apparent to those skilled in the art may be made in the arrangement, operation and details of the method and apparatus of the present invention disclosed herein without departing
from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.  Therefore, the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents.
<br/><br/> In alternate embodiments, the invention is implemented in computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof.  Apparatus of the invention can be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in a machine-readable
storage device for execution by a programmable processor; and method steps of the invention can be performed by a programmable processor executing a program of instructions to perform functions of the invention by operating on input data and generating
output.  The invention can be implemented advantageously in one or more computer programs that are executable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and
instructions to, a data storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.  Each computer program can be implemented in a high-level procedural or object-oriented programming language, or in assembly or machine language if
desired; and in any case, the language can be a compiled or interpreted language.  Suitable processors include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors.  Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a
read-only memory and/or a random access memory.  Generally, a computer will include one or more mass storage devices for storing data files; such devices include magnetic disks, such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and
optical disks.  Storage devices suitable for tangibly embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, such as EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices;
magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM disks.  Any of the foregoing can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) and other forms of hardware.
