</font><br/>
       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A method and system for electronic content storage and retrieval using
     Galois Fields and geometric shapes on cloud computing networks. Plaintext
     electronic content is divided into plural portions and stored in plural
     cloud storage objects based on a created X.sup.th dimensional geometric
     shape and a path through selected components of the geometric shape.
     Storage locations for the plural cloud storage objects are selected using
     a Galois field and the geometric shape. The plural cloud storage objects
     are distributed across the cloud network. When the electronic content is
     requested, the plural portions are retrieved and transparently combined
     back into the original electronic content. No server network devices
     storing the plural cloud storage objects or target network devices
     requesting the stored electronic can individually determine locations of
     all portions of the stored electronic content on the cloud communications
     network, thereby providing various levels of security and privacy for the
     electronic content without having to encrypt the plaintext electronic
     content on the cloud network.

<br/><br/> This invention relates to retrieving electronic information over a computer network.  More specifically, it relates to a method and system for electronic content storage and retrieval using Galois fields and geometric shapes on cloud computing
networks.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> "Cloud computing" is a term used to identify the delivery of computing requirements as a service to a heterogeneous community of end-recipients.  The term cloud theoretically signifies abstraction of technology, resources and locations that are
used in building an integrated computing infrastructure (including networks, systems, applications, etc.).  All Cloud computing models rely heavily on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale similar to a utility (like a grid for
electricity) over a network.
<br/><br/> Cloud computing provides services with a user's data, software and computation on over multiple networks.  End users access cloud based applications through a web browser or a light weight desktop or mobile application while the rest of the
application software and data are stored on servers at remote locations.  Cloud computing provides a same or better service and performance with cloud software programs as if al the cloud software programs were actually installed locally on end-user
devices.
<br/><br/> At the foundation of cloud computing is the broader concept of infrastructure convergence and shared services.  This type of cloud computing environment allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with easier
manageability and less maintenance, and enables the enterprise to more rapidly adjust resources (such as servers, storage, and networking) to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand.
<br/><br/> However, there are a number of problems associated with electronic content storage and retrieval on cloud computing network.
<br/><br/> One problem is how to efficiently store and retrieve electronic content on cloud computing networks.
<br/><br/> Another problem is providing proper privacy and security for electronic content stored and retrieved on cloud computing networks.
<br/><br/> Another problem is information entropy including information gain and mutual information of information stored on cloud computing networks.
<br/><br/> Another problem is storing plaintext on a cloud computing networks without encrypting the plaintext and providing various levels of security and privacy for the plaintext.
<br/><br/> Another problem is where to store and retrieve electronic content on a cloud computing network.
<br/><br/> Thus, it is desirable to solve some of the problems associated with content storage and retrieval with cloud computing networks.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, some of the problems associated with electronic content storage and retrieval on cloud computing networks are overcome.  A method and system for electronic content storage and
retrieval on cloud computing networks using Galois fields and geometric shapes is presented.
<br/><br/> The electronic content as plaintext is divided into plural portions and stored in plural cloud storage objects based a created X.sup.th dimensional geometric shape and a path through selected components of the geometric shape.  Storage locations
for the plural cloud storage objects are selected using a Galois field and the plural cloud storage objects are distributed across the cloud network.  When the electronic content is requested, the plural portions are retrieved and transparently combined
back into the original electronic content.  No server network devices storing the plural cloud storage objects or target network devices requesting the stored electronic can individually determine locations of all portions of the stored electronic
content on the cloud communications network, thereby providing various levels of security and privacy for the plaintext electronic content without having to encrypt the plaintext electronic content on the cloud network.

<br/><br/> The operating systems include the iPhone OS, Android, Windows, etc. iPhone OS is a proprietary operating system for the Apple iPhone.  Andriod is an open source operating system platform backed by Google, along with major hardware and software
developers (such as Intel, HTC, ARM, Motorola and Samsung, etc.), that form the Open Handset Alliance.
<br/><br/> The one or more smart network devices 12, 14, 16 include tablet computers such as the iPad, by Apple, Inc., the HP Tablet, by Hewlett Packard, Inc., the Playbook, by RIM, Inc., the Tablet, by Sony, Inc.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the one or more target network devices 12, 14, 16, include wearable target network devices 216-226 (FIG. 16).  The wearable network devices 216-226 also include smart wearable network devices.
<br/><br/> The target network devices 12, 14, 16 are in communications with a cloud communications network 18 via one or more wired and/or wireless communications interfaces.  The cloud communications network 18, is also called a "cloud computing network"
herein and the terms may be used interchangeably.
<br/><br/> The plural target network devices 12, 14, 16 request desired electronic content 13, 15, etc. stored on the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> The cloud communications network 18 includes, but is not limited to, communications over a wire connected to the target network devices, wireless communications, and other types of communications using one or more communications and/or
networking protocols.  The cloud communications network 18 can also be replaced with a non-cloud communications network 18'.
<br/><br/> Plural server network devices 20, 22, 24, 26 (only four of which are illustrated) each with one or more processors and a non-transitory computer readable medium include one or more associated databases 20', 22', 24', 26'.  The plural network
devices 20, 22, 24, 26 are in communications with the one or more target devices 12, 14, 16 via the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> Plural server network devices 20, 22, 24, 26 (only four of which are illustrated) are physically located on one more public networks 76 (See FIG. 4), private networks 72, community networks 74 and/or hybrid networks 78 comprising the cloud
network 18.
<br/><br/> One or more server network devices (e.g., 20, etc.) securely stores a cloud content location map 17 and other plural server network devices (e.g., 22, 24, 26, etc.) store portions 13', 15' of desired electronic content 13, 15 as cloud storage
objects 82 (FIG. 5) as is described herein.
<br/><br/> The plural server network devices 20, 22, 24 26, include, but are not limited to, World Wide Web servers, Internet servers, search engine servers, vertical search engine servers, social networking site servers, file servers, other types of
electronic information servers, and other types of server network devices (e.g., edge servers, firewalls, routers, gateways, etc.).
<br/><br/> The plural server network devices 20, 22, 24, 26 also include, but are not limited to, network servers used for cloud computing providers, etc.
<br/><br/> The cloud communications network 18 includes, but is not limited to, a wired and/or wireless communications network comprising one or more portions of: the Internet, an intranet, a Local Area Network (LAN), a wireless LAN (WiLAN), a Wide Area
Network (WAN), a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), a Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) and other types of wired and/or wireless communications networks 18.
<br/><br/> The cloud communications network 18 includes one or more gateways, routers, bridges and/or switches.  A gateway connects computer networks using different network protocols and/or operating at different transmission capacities.  A router
receives transmitted messages and forwards them to their correct destinations over the most efficient available route.  A bridge is a device that connects networks using the same communications protocols so that information can be passed from one network
device to another.  A switch is a device that filters and forwards packets between network segments based on some pre-determined sequence (e.g., timing, sequence number, etc.).
<br/><br/> An operating environment for the network devices of the exemplary electronic information display system 10 include a processing system with one or more high speed Central Processing Unit(s) (CPU), processors, one or more memories and/or other
types of non-transitory computer readable mediums.  In accordance with the practices of persons skilled in the art of computer programming, the present invention is described below with reference to acts and symbolic representations of operations or
instructions that are performed by the processing system, unless indicated otherwise.  Such acts and operations or instructions are referred to as being "computer-executed," "CPU-executed," or "processor-executed."
<br/><br/> It will be appreciated that acts and symbolically represented operations or instructions include the manipulation of electrical information by the CPU or processor.  An electrical system represents data bits which cause a resulting
transformation or reduction of the electrical information or biological information, and the maintenance of data bits at memory locations in a memory system to thereby reconfigure or otherwise alter the CPU's or processor's operation, as well as other
processing of information.  The memory locations where data bits are maintained are physical locations that have particular electrical, magnetic, optical, or organic properties corresponding to the data bits.
<br/><br/> The data bits may also be maintained on a non-transitory computer readable medium including magnetic disks, optical disks, organic memory, and any other volatile (e.g., Random Access Memory (RAM)) or non-volatile (e.g., Read-Only Memory (ROM),
flash memory, etc.) mass storage system readable by the CPU.  The non-transitory computer readable medium includes cooperating or interconnected computer readable medium, which exist exclusively on the processing system or can be distributed among
multiple interconnected processing systems that may be local or remote to the processing system.

cloud application 30 and a display component 32.  The cloud application 30 presents a graphical user interface (GUI) 34 on the display 32 component.  The GUI 32 presents a multi-window 36, 38, etc. (only two of which are illustrated) interface to a user.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the invention, the cloud application 30 is a software application.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and the cloud application 30 can be hardware, firmware, hardware and/or any combination
thereof.  However, the present invention is not limited these embodiments and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, a portion of the cloud application 30 is executing on the target network devices 12, 14, 16 and another portion of the application 30' is executing on the server network devices 20, 22, 24, 26 However, the present
invention is not limited these embodiments and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> Exemplary Networking Protocol Stack
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 a block diagram illustrating a layered protocol stack 38 for network devices in the electronic information display system 10.  The layered protocol stack 38 is described with respect to Internet Protocol (IP) suites comprising in general
from lowest-to-highest, a link 42, network 44, transport 48 and application 57 layer.  However, more or fewer layers could also be used, and different layer designations could also be used for the layers in the protocol stack 38 (e.g., layering based on
the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model including from lowest-to-highest, a physical, data-link, network, transport, session, presentation and application layer.).
<br/><br/> The network devices 12, 14, 16, 20, 22, 24, 26 are connected to the communication network 18 with Network Interface Card (NIC) cards including device drivers 40 in a link layer 42 for the actual hardware connecting the network devices 12, 14,
16, 20, 22, 24, 26 to the cloud communications network 18.  For example, the NIC device drivers 40 may include a serial port device driver, a digital subscriber line (DSL) device driver, an Ethernet device driver, a wireless device driver, a wired device
driver, etc. The device drivers interface with the actual hardware being used to connect the network devices to the cloud communications network 18.  The NIC cards have a medium access control (MAC) address that is unique to each NIC and unique across
the whole cloud network 18.  The Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is used to provide a data link layer of an Ethernet LAN system and for other network systems.
<br/><br/> Above the link layer 42 is a network layer 44 (also called the Internet Layer for Internet Protocol (IP) suites).  The network layer 44 includes, but is not limited to, an IP layer 46.
<br/><br/> IP 46 is an addressing protocol designed to route traffic within a network or between networks.  However, more fewer or other protocols can also be used in the network layer 44, and the present invention is not limited to IP 46.  For more
information on IP 46 see IETF RFC-791, incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> Above network layer 44 is a transport layer 48.  The transport layer 48 includes, but is not limited to, an optional Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) layer 50, an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) layer 52, a Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) layer 54 and a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) layer 56.  However, more, fewer or other protocols could also be used in the transport layer 48.
<br/><br/> Optional IGMP layer 50, hereinafter IGMP 50, is responsible for multicasting.  For more information on IGMP 50 see RFC-1112, incorporated herein by reference.  ICMP layer 52, hereinafter ICMP 52 is used for IP 46 control.  The main functions of
ICMP 52 include error reporting, reachability testing (e.g., pinging, etc.), route-change notification, performance, subnet addressing and other maintenance.  For more information on ICMP 52 see RFC-792, incorporated herein by reference.  Both IGMP 50
and ICMP 52 are not required in the protocol stack 38.  ICMP 52 can be used alone without optional IGMP layer 50.
<br/><br/> TCP layer 54, hereinafter TCP 54, provides a connection-oriented, end-to-end reliable protocol designed to fit into a layered hierarchy of protocols which support multi-network applications.  TCP 54 provides for reliable inter-process
communication between pairs of processes in network devices attached to distinct but interconnected networks.  For more information on TCP 54 see RFC-793, incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> UDP layer 56, hereinafter UDP 56, provides a connectionless mode of communications with datagrams in an interconnected set of computer networks.  UDP 56 provides a transaction oriented datagram protocol, where delivery and duplicate packet
protection are not guaranteed.  For more information on UDP 56 see RFC-768, incorporated herein by reference.  Both TCP 54 and UDP 56 are not required in protocol stack 38.  Either TCP 54 or UDP 56 can be used without the other.
<br/><br/> Above transport layer 48 is an application layer 57 where application programs 58 (e.g., 30, 30', etc.) to carry out desired functionality for a network device reside.  For example, the application programs 58 for the client network devices 12,
14, 16 may include a web-browsers or other application programs, cloud application program 30, while application programs for the server network devices 20, 22, 24, 26 may include other application programs (e.g., 30', etc.).
<br/><br/> However, the protocol stack 38 is not limited to the protocol layers illustrated and more, fewer or other layers and protocols can also be used in protocol stack 38.  In addition, other protocols from the Internet Protocol suites (e.g., Simple
Mail Transfer Protocol, (SMTP), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), DNS, etc.) and/or other protocols from other protocol suites may also be used in protocol stack 38.
<br/><br/> Preferred embodiments of the present invention include network devices and wired and wireless interfaces that are compliant with all or part of standards proposed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), International
Telecommunications Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU), European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), U.S.  National Institute of Security Technology (NIST), American National Standard
Institute (ANSI), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Forum, Bluetooth Forum, or the ADSL Forum.
<br/><br/> Wireless Interfaces
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the present invention, the wireless interfaces on network devices 12, 14, 16, 20, 22, 24, 26 include but are not limited to, 3G and/or 4G IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.15.4 (ZigBee), "Wireless Fidelity"
(Wi-Fi), "Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access" (WiMAX), ETSI High Performance Radio Metropolitan Area Network (HIPERMAN) or "RF Home" wireless interfaces.  In another embodiment of the present invention, the wireless sensor device may include
an integral or separate Bluetooth and/or infra data association (IrDA) module for wireless Bluetooth or wireless infrared communications.  However, the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other 802.11xx and other types of wireless
interfaces can also be used.
<br/><br/> 802.11b is a short-range wireless network standard.  The IEEE 802.11b standard defines wireless interfaces that provide up to 11 Mbps wireless data transmission to and from wireless devices over short ranges.  802.11a is an extension of the
802.11b and can deliver speeds up to 54 M bps.  802.11g deliver speeds on par with 802.11a.  However, other 802.11XX interfaces can also be used and the present invention is not limited to the 802.11 protocols defined.  The IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and
802.11g standards are incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> Wi-Fi is a type of 802.11xx interface, whether 802.11b, 802.11a, dual-band, etc. Wi-Fi devices include an RF interfaces such as 2.4 GHz for 802.11b or 802.11g and 5 GHz for 802.11a.
<br/><br/> 802.15.4 (Zigbee) is low data rate network standard used for mesh network and non-mesh network devices such as sensors, interactive toys, smart badges, remote controls, and home automation.  The 802.15.4 standard provides data rates of 250 kbps,
40 kbps, and 20 kbps., two addressing modes; 16-bit short and 64-bit IEEE addressing, support for critical latency devices, such as joysticks, Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance, (CSMA-CA) channel access, automatic network establishment by

(Worldwide), 10 channels in the 915 MHz (US) and one channel in the 868 MHz band (Europe).  The IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standard is incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> WiMAX is an industry trade organization formed by leading communications component and equipment companies to promote and certify compatibility and interoperability of broadband wireless access equipment that conforms to the IEEE 802.16XX and
ETSI HIPERMAN.  HIPERMAN is the European standard for metropolitan area networks (MAN).
<br/><br/> The IEEE The 802.16a and 802.16g standards are wireless MAN technology standard that provides a wireless alternative to cable, DSL and T1/E1 for last mile broadband access.  It is also used as complimentary technology to connect IEEE 802.11XX
hot spots to the Internet.
<br/><br/> The IEEE 802.16a standard for 2-11 GHz is a wireless MAN technology that provides broadband wireless connectivity to fixed, portable and nomadic devices.  It provides up to 50-kilometers of service area range, allows users to get broadband
connectivity without needing direct line of sight with the base station, and provides total data rates of up to 280 Mbps per base station, which is enough bandwidth to simultaneously support hundreds of businesses with T1/E1-type connectivity and
thousands of homes with DSL-type connectivity with a single base station.  The IEEE 802.16g provides up to 100 Mbps.
<br/><br/> The IEEE 802.16e standard is an extension to the approved IEEE 802.16/16a/16g standard.  The purpose of 802.16e is to add limited mobility to the current standard which is designed for fixed operation.
<br/><br/> The ESTI HIPERMAN standard is an interoperable broadband fixed wireless access standard for systems operating at radio frequencies between 2 GHz and 11 GHz.
<br/><br/> The IEEE 802.16a, 802.16e and 802.16g standards are incorporated herein by reference.  WiMAX can be used to provide a WLP.

used to provide a WLP.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the plural server network devices 20, 22, 24, 26 include a connection to plural network interface cards (NICs) in a backplane connected to a communications bus.  The NIC cards provide gigabit/second (1.times.10.sup.9
bits/second) communications speed of electronic information.  This allows "scaling out" for fast electronic content retrieval.  The NICs are connected to the plural server network devices 20, 22, 24, 26 and the cloud communications network 18.  However,
the present invention is not limited to the NICs described and other types of NICs in other configurations and connections with and/or without a buses can also be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, network devices 12, 14, 16, 20, 22, 24, 26 and wired and wireless interfaces including the NICs include "4G" components.  "4G" refers to the fourth generation of wireless communications standards and speeds of 100
megabits/second to gigabits/second or more.  4G includes peak speed requirements for 4G service at least 100 Mbit/s for high mobility communication (e.g., trains, vehicles, etc.) and 1 Gbit/s for low mobility communication (e.g., pedestrians and
stationary users, etc.).
<br/><br/> 4G and 5G technologies are a successor to 3G and 2G standards.  The nomenclature of the generations generally refers to a change in the fundamental nature of the service.  The first was the move from analogue (1G) to digital (2G) transmission. 
This was followed by multi-media support, spread spectrum transmission and at least 200 kbits/second (3G).  The 4G NICs include IP packet-switched NICs, wired and wireless ultra-broadband (i.e., gigabit speed) access NICs, Worldwide Interoperability for
Microwave Access (WiMAX) NICs WiMAX Long Term Evolution (LTE) and/or multi-carrier transmission NICs.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and 1G, 2G and 3G and/or any combination thereof, with or with 4G and/or 5G NICs can
be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the invention, the WiMAX interfaces includes WiMAX 4G or 5G Long Term Evolution (LTE) interfaces.  The ITU announced in December 2010 that WiMAX and LTE are 4G technologies.  One of the benefits of 4G LTE is the ability to
take advantage of advanced topology networks including those on cloud communications networks 18 such as optimized heterogeneous networks with a mix of macrocells with low power nodes such as picocells, femtocells and new relay nodes.  LTE further
improves the capacity and coverage, and helps ensures user fairness.  4G LTE also introduces multicarrier technologies for ultra-wide bandwidth use, up to 100 MHz of spectrum supporting very high data rates.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, of the invention, the wireless interfaces also include wireless personal area network (WPAN) interfaces.  As is known in the art, a WPAN is a personal area network for interconnecting devices centered around an individual
person's devices in which the connections are wireless.  A WPAN interconnects all the ordinary computing and communicating devices that a person has on their desk (e.g. computer, etc.) or carry with them (e.g., PDA, mobile phone, smart phone, table
computer two-way pager, etc.)
<br/><br/> A key concept in WPAN technology is known as "plugging in." In the ideal scenario, when any two WPAN-equipped devices come into close proximity (within several meters and/or feet of each other) or within a few miles and/or kilometers of a
central server (not illustrated), they can communicate via wireless communications as if connected by a cable.  WPAN devices can also lock out other devices selectively, preventing needless interference or unauthorized access to secure information. 
Zigbee is one wireless protocol used on WPAN networks such as cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> The one or more target network devices 12, 14, 16 and one or more server network devices 20, 22, 24, 26 communicate with each other and other network devices with near field communications (NFC) and/or machine-to-machine (M2M) communications.
<br/><br/> "Near field communication (NFC)" is a set of standards for smartphones and similar network devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into close proximity, usually no more than a few
centimeters.  Present applications include contactless transactions, data exchange, and simplified setup of more complex communications such as Wi-Fi.  Communication is also possible between an NFC device and an unpowered NFC chip, called a "tag"
including radio frequency identifier (RFID) tags and/or sensor.
<br/><br/> NFC standards cover communications protocols and data exchange formats, and are based on existing radio-frequency identification (RFID) standards including ISO/IEC 14443 and FeliCa.  These standards include ISO/IEC 1809 and those defined by the
NFC Forum, all of which are incorporated by reference.
<br/><br/> An "RFID tag" is an object that can be applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification and/or tracking using RF signals.
<br/><br/> An "RFID sensor" is a device that measures a physical quantity and converts it into an RF signal which can be read by an observer or by an instrument (e.g., target network devices 12, 14, 16 , server network devices 20, 22, 24, 26, etc.)
<br/><br/> "Machine to machine (M2M)" refers to technologies that allow both wireless and wired systems to communicate with other devices of the same ability.  M2M uses a device to capture an event (such as option purchase, etc.), which is relayed through
a network (wireless, wired cloud, etc.) to an application (software program), that translates the captured event into meaningful information.  Such communication was originally accomplished by having a remote network of machines relay information back to
a central hub for analysis, which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal computer.
<br/><br/> However, modern M2M communication has expanded beyond a one-to-one connection and changed into a system of networks that transmits data many-to-one and many-to-many to plural different types of devices and appliances.  The expansion of IP
networks across the world has made it far easier for M2M communication to take place and has lessened the amount of power and time necessary for information to be communicated between machines.
<br/><br/> However, the present invention is not limited to such wireless interfaces and wireless networks and more, fewer and/or other wireless interfaces can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> Wired Interfaces
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the present invention, the wired interfaces include wired interfaces and corresponding networking protocols for wired connections to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and/or a cable television network (CATV)
and/or satellite television networks (SATV) and/or three-dimensional television (3DTV), including HDTV that connect the network devices 12, 14, 16, 20, 22, 24, 26 via one or more twisted pairs of copper wires, digital subscriber lines (e.g. DSL, ADSL,
VDSL, etc.) coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, other connection media or other connection interfaces.  The PSTN is any public switched telephone network provided by AT&amp;T, GTE, Sprint, MCI, SBC, Verizon and others.  The CATV is any cable television network
provided by the Comcast, Time Warner, etc. However, the present invention is not limited to such wired interfaces and more, fewer and/or other wired interfaces can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> Television Services
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the cloud applications 30, 30' provide cloud electronic content storage and retrieval services from television services over the cloud communications network 18.  The television services include digital television services,
including, but not limited to, cable television, satellite television, high-definition television, three-dimensional, televisions and other types of network devices.
<br/><br/> However, the present invention is not limited to such television services and more, fewer and/or other television services can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> Internet Television Services
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the cloud applications 30, 30' provide cloud electronic content storage and retrieval services from Internet television services over the cloud communications network 18.  The television services include Internet television,
Web-TV, and/or Internet Protocol Television (IPtv) and/or other broadcast television services.
<br/><br/> "Internet television" allows users to choose a program or the television show they want to watch from an archive of programs or from a channel directory.  The two forms of viewing Internet television are streaming content directly to a media
player or simply downloading a program to a viewer's set-top box, game console, computer, or other network device.
<br/><br/> "Web-TV" delivers digital content via broadband and mobile networks.  The digital content is streamed to a viewer's set-top box, game console, computer, or other network device.
<br/><br/> "Internet Protocol television (IPtv)" is a system through which Internet television services are delivered using the architecture and networking methods of the Internet Protocol Suite over a packet-switched network infrastructure, e.g., the
Internet and broadband Internet access networks, instead of being delivered through traditional radio frequency broadcast, satellite signal, and cable television formats.
<br/><br/> However, the present invention is not limited to such Internet Television services and more, fewer and/or other Internet Television services can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> General Search Engine Services
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the cloud applications 30, 30' provide cloud electronic content storage and retrieval services from general search engine services.  A search engine is designed to search for information on a cloud communications network 18
such as the Internet including World Wide Web servers, HTTP, FTP servers etc. The search results are generally presented in a list of electronic results.  The information may consist of web pages, images, electronic information, multimedia information,
and other types of files.  Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories.  Unlike web directories, which are maintained by human editors, search engines typically operate algorithmically and/or are a mixture of algorithmic
and human input.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the cloud applications 30, 30' provide cloud electronic content storage and retrieval services from general search engine services.  In another embodiment, the cloud applications 30, 30' provide general search engine services
by interacting with one or more other public search engines (e.g., GOOGLE, BING, YAHOO, etc.) and/or private search engine services.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the cloud applications 30, 30' provide electronic content storage and retrieval services from specialized search engine services, such as vertical search engine services by interacting with one or more other public
vertical search engines (e.g., GALAXY.COM, etc.) and/or private search engine services.
<br/><br/> However, the present invention is not limited to such general and/or vertical search engine services and more, fewer and/or other general search engine services can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> Social Networking Services
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the cloud applications 30, 30' provide cloud electronic content storage and retrieval services from one more social networking services including to/from one or more social networking web-sites (e.g., <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> U-TUBE,
TWITTER, MY-SPACE, MATCH.COM, E-HARMONY, GROUP ON, SOCIAL LIVING, etc.).  The social networking web-sites also include, but are not limited to, social couponing sites, dating web-sites, blogs, RSS feeds, and other types of information web-sites in which
messages can be left or posted for a variety of social activities.
<br/><br/> However, the present invention is not limited to the social networking services described and other public and private social networking services can also be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> Music Downloading Services
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the cloud applications 30, 30' provide cloud electronic content storage and retrieval services from one more music downloading services (e.g., ITUNES, RHAPSODY, etc.) at one or more music downloading sites.
<br/><br/> However, the present invention is not limited to the social networking services described and other public and private social networking services can also be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> Security and Encryption
<br/><br/> Network devices 12, 14, 16, 20, 22, 24, 26 with wired and/or wireless interfaces of the present invention include one or more of the security and encryptions techniques discussed herein for secure communications on the cloud communications
network 18.
<br/><br/> Application programs 58 (FIG. 2) include security and/or encryption application programs integral to and/or separate from the cloud applications 30, 30' Security and/or encryption programs may also exist in hardware components on the network
devices (12, 14, 16, 20, 22, 24, 26) described herein and/or exist in a combination of hardware, software and/or firmware.
<br/><br/> Wireless Encryption Protocol (WEP) (also called "Wired Equivalent Privacy) is a security protocol for WiLANs defined in the IEEE 802.11b standard.  WEP is cryptographic privacy algorithm, based on the Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) encryption engine,
used to provide confidentiality for 802.11b wireless data.
<br/><br/> RC4 is cipher designed by RSA Data Security, Inc.  of Bedford, Mass., which can accept encryption keys of arbitrary length, and is essentially a pseudo random number generator with an output of the generator being XORed with a data stream to
produce encrypted data.
<br/><br/> One problem with WEP is that it is used at the two lowest layers of the OSI model, the physical layer and the data link layer, therefore, it does not offer end-to-end security.  One another problem with WEP is that its encryption keys are static
rather than dynamic.  To update WEP encryption keys, an individual has to manually update a WEP key.  WEP also typically uses 40-bit static keys for encryption and thus provides "weak encryption," making a WEP device a target of hackers.
<br/><br/> The IEEE 802.11 Working Group is working on a security upgrade for the 802.11 standard called "802.11i." This supplemental draft standard is intended to improve WiLAN security.  It describes the encrypted transmission of data between systems
802.11X WiLANs.  It also defines new encryption key protocols including the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP).  The IEEE 802.11i draft standard, version 4, completed Jun.  6, 2003, is incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> The 802.11i is based on 802.1x port-based authentication for user and device authentication.  The 802.11i standard includes two main developments: Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Robust Security Network (RSN).
<br/><br/> WPA uses the same RC4 underlying encryption algorithm as WEP.  However, WPA uses TKIP to improve security of keys used with WEP.  WPA keys are derived and rotated more often than WEP keys and thus provide additional security.  WPA also adds a
message-integrity-check function to prevent packet forgeries.
<br/><br/> RSN uses dynamic negotiation of authentication and selectable encryption algorithms between wireless access points and wireless devices.  The authentication schemes proposed in the draft standard include Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). One proposed encryption algorithm is an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm.
<br/><br/> Dynamic negotiation of authentication and encryption algorithms lets RSN evolve with the state of the art in security, adding algorithms to address new threats and continuing to provide the security necessary to protect information that WiLANs
carry.
<br/><br/> The NIST developed a new encryption standard, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to keep government information secure.  AES is intended to be a stronger, more efficient successor to Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES).
<br/><br/> DES is a popular symmetric-key encryption method developed in 1975 and standardized by ANSI in 1981 as ANSI X.3.92, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.  As is known in the art, 3DES is the encrypt-decrypt-encrypt (EDE)
mode of the DES cipher algorithm.  3DES is defined in the ANSI standard, ANSI X9.52-1998, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.  DES modes of operation are used in conjunction with the NIST Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) for data encryption (FIPS 46-3, October 1999), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> The NIST approved a FIPS for the AES, FIPS-197.  This standard specified "Rijndael" encryption as a FIPS-approved symmetric encryption algorithm that may be used by U.S.  Government organizations (and others) to protect sensitive information. 
The NIST FIPS-197 standard (AES FIPS PUB 197, November 2001) is incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> The NIST approved a FIPS for U.S.  Federal Government requirements for information technology products for sensitive but unclassified (SBU) communications.  The NIST FIPS Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules (FIPS PUB 140-2, May 2001)
is incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> RSA is a public key encryption system which can be used both for encrypting messages and making digital signatures.  The letters RSA stand for the names of the inventors: Rivest, Shamir and Adleman.  For more information on RSA, see U.S.  Pat. 
No. 4,405,829, now expired, incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> "Hashing" is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string.  Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a database because it is faster to find the item
using the shorter hashed key than to find it using the original value.  It is also used in many encryption algorithms.
<br/><br/> Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), is used for computing a secure condensed representation of a data message or a data file.  When a message of any length &lt;2.sup.64 bits is input, the SHA-1 produces a 160-bit output called a "message digest." The
message digest can then be input to other security techniques such as encryption, a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) and others which generates or verifies a security mechanism for the message.  SHA-512 outputs a 512-bit message digest.  The Secure Hash
Standard, FIPS PUB 180-1, Apr.  17, 1995, is incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> Message Digest-5 (MD-5) takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit "message digest" of the input.  The MD5 algorithm is intended for digital signature applications, where a large file must be "compressed" in a
secure manner before being encrypted with a private (secret) key under a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA.  The IETF RFC-1321, entitled "The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm" is incorporated here by reference.
<br/><br/> Providing a way to check the integrity of information transmitted over or stored in an unreliable medium such as a wireless network is a prime necessity in the world of open computing and communications.  Mechanisms that provide such integrity
check based on a secret key are called "message authentication codes" (MAC).  Typically, message authentication codes are used between two parties that share a secret key in order to validate information transmitted between these parties.
<br/><br/> Keyed Hashing for Message Authentication Codes (HMAC), is a mechanism for message authentication using cryptographic hash functions.  HMAC is used with any iterative cryptographic hash function, e.g., MD5, SHA-1, SHA-512, etc. in combination
with a secret shared key.  The cryptographic strength of HMAC depends on the properties of the underlying hash function.  The IETF RFC-2101, entitled "HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication" is incorporated here by reference.
<br/><br/> An Electronic Code Book (ECB) is a mode of operation for a "block cipher," with the characteristic that each possible block of plaintext has a defined corresponding cipher text value and vice versa.  In other words, the same plaintext value will
always result in the same cipher text value.  Electronic Code Book is used when a volume of plaintext is separated into several blocks of data, each of which is then encrypted independently of other blocks.  The Electronic Code Book has the ability to
support a separate encryption key for each block type.
<br/><br/> Diffie and Hellman (DH) describe several different group methods for two parties to agree upon a shared secret in such a way that the secret will be unavailable to eavesdroppers.  This secret is then converted into various types of cryptographic
keys.  A large number of the variants of the DH method exist including ANSI X9.42.  The IETF RFC-2631, entitled "Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Method" is incorporated here by reference.
<br/><br/> The HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) Secure (HTTPs), is a standard for encrypted communications on the World Wide Web.  HTTPs is actually just HTTP over a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).  For more information on HTTP, see IETF RFC-2616
incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> The SSL protocol is a protocol layer which may be placed between a reliable connection-oriented network layer protocol (e.g. TCP/IP) and the application protocol layer (e.g. HTTP).  SSL provides for secure communication between a source and
destination by allowing mutual authentication, the use of digital signatures for integrity, and encryption for privacy.
<br/><br/> The SSL protocol is designed to support a range of choices for specific security methods used for cryptography, message digests, and digital signatures.  The security method are negotiated between the source and destination at the start of
establishing a protocol session.  The SSL 2.0 protocol specification, by Kipp E. B. Hickman, 1995 is incorporated herein by reference.  More information on SSL is available at the domain name See "netscape.com/eng/security/SSL_2.html."
<br/><br/> Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides communications privacy over the Internet.  The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate over a transport layer (e.g., TCP) in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or
message forgery.  For more information on TLS see IETF RFC-2246, incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the security functionality includes Cisco Compatible EXtensions (CCX).  CCX includes security specifications for makers of 802.11xx wireless LAN chips for ensuring compliance with Cisco's proprietary wireless security LAN
protocols.  As is known in the art, Cisco Systems, Inc.  of San Jose, Calif.  is supplier of networking hardware and software, including router and security products.
<br/><br/> "Integrated Encryption Scheme (IES)" is a hybrid encryption scheme which provides semantic security against an adversary who is allowed to use chosen-plaintext and chosen-ciphertext attacks.  The security of the scheme is based on the
Diffie-Hellman problem.  Two incarnations of the IES are standardized: Discrete Logarithm Integrated Encryption Scheme (DLIES) and Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES), which is also known as the Elliptic Curve Augmented Encryption Scheme
or simply the Elliptic Curve Encryption Scheme.  For more information, see Standards for efficient cryptography, SEC 1: Elliptic Curve Cryptography, Version 2.0, May 21, 2009, the contents of which are incorporated by reference.
<br/><br/> "Homomorphic encryption" is a form of encryption where a specific algebraic operation performed on the plaintext is equivalent to another (possibly different) algebraic operation performed on the ciphertext.  Homomorphic encryption schemes are
malleable by design.  The homomorphic property of various cryptosystems is used with cloud computing by ensuring the confidentiality of processed data.  The "homomorphic" part of a fully homomorphic encryption scheme can also be described in terms of
category theory.  If C is the category whose objects are integers (i.e., finite streams of data) and whose morphisms are computable functions, then (ideally) a fully homomorphic encryption scheme elevates an encryption function to a function from C to
itself.
<br/><br/> A "one-time pad" (OTP) is a type of encryption which has been proven to be impossible to crack if used correctly.  Each bit or character from the plaintext is encrypted by a modular addition with a bit or character from a secret random key (or
pad) of the same length as the plaintext, resulting in a ciphertext.  If the key is truly random, as large as or greater than the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and kept secret, the ciphertext will likely be impossible to decrypt or break
without knowing the key.
<br/><br/> However, the present invention is not limited to such security and encryption methods described herein and more, fewer and/or other types of security and encryption methods can be used to practice the invention.  The security and encryption
methods described herein can also be used in various combinations and/or in different layers of the protocol stack 38 with each other.
<br/><br/> Cloud Computing Networks
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a block diagram 60 illustrating an exemplary cloud computing network 18.  The cloud computing network 18 is also referred to as a "cloud communications network" 18.  However, the present invention is not limited to this cloud computing
model and other cloud computing models can also be used to practice the invention.  The exemplary cloud communications network includes both wired and/or wireless components of public and private networks.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the cloud computing network 18 includes a cloud communications network 18 comprising plural different cloud component networks 72, 74, 76, 78.  "Cloud computing" is a model for enabling, on-demand network access to a shared
pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., public and private networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that are shared, rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
<br/><br/> This exemplary cloud computing model for electronic information retrieval promotes availability for shared resources and comprises: (1) cloud computing essential characteristics; (2) cloud computing service models; and (3) cloud computing
deployment models.  However, the present invention is not limited to this cloud computing model and other cloud computing models can also be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> Exemplary cloud computing essential characteristics appear in Table 1.  However, the present invention is not limited to these essential characteristics and more, fewer or other characteristics can also be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 1.  On-demand electronic content storage and retrieval services.  Electronic content storage and retrievers can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed
automatically without requiring human interaction with each network server on the cloud communications network 18.  2.  Broadband network access.  Electronic content storage and retrieval capabilities are available over plural broadband communications
networks and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, smart phones 14, tablet computers 12, laptops, PDAs, etc.).  The broadband network access includes high speed network
access such as 3G and/or 4G wireless and/or wired and broadband and/or ultra-broad band (e.g., WiMAX, etc.) network access.  3.  Resource pooling.  Electronic content storage retrieval computing resources are pooled to serve multiple requesters using a
multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to electronic content retrieval demand.  There is location independence in that a requester of electronic content has no control and/or
knowledge over the exact location of the provided by the electronic content storage and retrieval resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or data center).  Examples of pooled resources include
storage, processing, memory, network bandwidth, virtual server network device and virtual target network devices.  4.  Rapid elasticity.  Capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned, in some cases automatically, to quickly scale out and
rapidly released to quickly scale for electronic content storage and retrieval.  To the electronic content storage and retrievers, the electronic content storage and retrieval capabilities available for provisioning appear to be unlimited and can be used
in any quantity at any time.  5.  Measured Services.  Cloud computing systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of electronic content retrieval service
(e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, custom electronic content retrieval applications, etc.).  Electronic content retrieval usage is monitored, controlled, and reported providing transparency for both the electronic content provider and the electronic
content requester of the utilized electronic content storage retrieval service.
<br/><br/> Exemplary cloud computing service models illustrated in FIG. 4 appear in Table 2.  However, the present invention is not limited to these service models and more, fewer or other service models can also be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 1.  Cloud Computing Software Applications 62 for an Electronic Content Storage and Retrieval Service (CCSA 64).  The capability to use the provider's applications 30, 30' running on a cloud infrastructure 66.  The cloud
computing applications 62, are accessible from the server network device 20 from various client devices 12, 14, 16 through a thin client interface such as a web browser, etc. The user does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure 66
including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application 30, 30' capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.  2.  Cloud Computing Infrastructure 66 for an Electronic
Content Storage and Retrieval Service (CCI 68).  The capability provided to the user is to provision processing, storage and retrieval, networks 18, 72, 74, 76, 78 and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run
arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications 30, 30'.  The user does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure 66 but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and possibly limited
control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls, etc.).  3.  Cloud Computing Platform 70 for an Electronic Content Storage and Retrieval Service (CCP 71).  The capability provided to the user to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure 66
created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported servers 20, 22, 24, 26, etc..  The user not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure 66 including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but
has control over the deployed applications 30, 30' and possibly application hosting environment configurations.
<br/><br/> Exemplary cloud computing deployment models appear in Table 3.  However, the present invention is not limited to these deployment models and more, fewer or other deployment models can also be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00003 TABLE 3 1.  Private cloud network 72.  The cloud network infrastructure is operated solely for an electronic content storage and retrieval.  It may be managed by the electronic content retrieval or a third party and may exist on
premise or off premise.  2.  Community cloud network 74.  The cloud network infrastructure is shared by several different organizations and supports a specific electronic content storage and retrieval community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission,
security requirements, policy, compliance considerations, etc.).  It may be managed by the different organizations or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise.  3.  Public cloud network 76.  The cloud network infrastructure such as the
Internet, PSTN, SATV, CATV, Internet TV, etc. is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by one or more organizations selling cloud services.  4.  Hybrid cloud network 78.  The cloud network infrastructure 66 is a
composition of two or more different networks and/or two or more cloud networks 18 (e.g., private 72, community 74, and/or public 76, etc.) and/or other types of public and/or private networks (e.g., intranets, etc.) that remain unique entities but are
bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds, etc.)
<br/><br/> Cloud software 64 for electronic content retrieval takes full advantage of the cloud paradigm by being service oriented with a focus on statelessness, low coupling, modularity, and semantic interoperability for electronic content retrieval. 
However, cloud software services 64 can include various states.
<br/><br/> Cloud storage of desired electronic content on a cloud computing network includes agility, scalability, elasticity and multi-tenancy.  Although a storage foundation may be comprised of block storage or file storage such as that exists on
conventional networks, cloud storage is typically exposed to requesters of desired electronic content as cloud objects.
<br/><br/> In one exemplary embodiment, the cloud application 30', offers cloud services for electronic content storage and retrieval.  The application 30, 30' offers the cloud computing Infrastructure 66, 68 as a Service 62 (IaaS), including a cloud
software infrastructure service 62, the cloud Platform 70, 71 as a Service 62 (PaaS) including a cloud software platform service 62 and/or offers Specific cloud software services as a Service 62 (SaaS) including a specific cloud software service 62 for
electronic content storage and retrieval.  The laaS, PaaS and SaaS include one or more of cloud services 62 comprising networking, storage, server network device, virtualization, operating system, middleware, run-time, data and/or application services,
or plural combinations thereof, on the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a block diagram 80 illustrating an exemplary cloud storage object 82.
<br/><br/> The cloud storage object 82 includes an envelope portion 84, with a header portion 86, and a body portion 88.  However, the present invention is not limited to such a cloud storage object 82 and other cloud storage objects and other cloud
storage objects with more, fewer or other portions can also be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> The envelope portion 84 uses unique namespace Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and/or Uniform Resource Names (URNs), and/or Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) unique across the cloud communications network 18 to uniquely specify, location and
version information and encoding rules used by the cloud storage object 82 across the whole cloud communications network 18.  For more information, see IETF RFC-3305, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), URLs, and Uniform Resource Names (URNs), the
contents of which are incorporated by reference.
<br/><br/> The envelope portion 84 of the cloud storage object 82 is followed by a header portion 86.  The header portion 86 includes extended information about the cloud storage objects such as authorization and/or transaction information, etc.
<br/><br/> The body portion 88 includes methods 90 (i.e., a sequence of instructions, etc.) for using embedded application-specific data in data elements 92.  The body portion 88 typically includes only one portion of plural portions of
application-specific data 92 and independent data 94 so the cloud storage object 82 can provide distributed, redundant fault tolerant, security and privacy features described herein.
<br/><br/> Cloud storage objects 82 have proven experimentally to be a highly scalable, available and reliable layer of abstraction that also minimizes the limitations of common file systems.  Cloud storage objects 82 also provide low latency and low
storage and transmission costs.
<br/><br/> Cloud storage objects 82 are comprised of many distributed resources, but function as a single storage object, are highly fault tolerant through redundancy and provide distribution of desired electronic content across public communication
networks 76, and one or more private networks 72, community networks 74 and hybrid networks 78 of the cloud communications network 18.  Cloud storage objects 82 are also highly durable because of creation of copies of portions of desired electronic
content across such networks 72, 74, 76, 78 of the cloud communications network 18.  Cloud storage objects 82 includes one or more portions of desired electronic content and can be stored on any of the 72, 74, 76, 78 networks of the cloud communications
network 18.  Cloud storage objects 82 are transparent to a requester of desired electronic content and are managed by cloud applications 30, 30'.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, cloud storage objects 82 are configurable arbitrary objects with a size up to hundreds of terabytes, each accompanied by with a few kilobytes of metadata.  Cloud objects are organized into and identified by a unique identifier
unique across the whole cloud communications network 18.  However, the present invention is not limited to the cloud storage objects described, and more fewer and other types of cloud storage objects can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> Cloud storage objects 82 present a single unified namespace or object-space and manages desired electronic content by user or administrator-defined policies storage and retrieval policies.  Cloud storage objects includes Representational state
transfer (REST), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and/or Application Programming Interface (API) objects and/or other types of cloud storage objects.  However, the present invention is not limited to the
cloud storage objects described, and more fewer and other types of cloud storage objects can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> REST is a protocol specification that characterizes and constrains macro-interactions storage objects of the four components of a cloud communications network 18, namely origin servers, gateways, proxies and clients, without imposing limitations
on the individual participants.
<br/><br/> SOAP is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of cloud services with storage objects.  SOAP has at least three major characteristics: (1) Extensibility (including security/encryption, routing,
etc.); (2) Neutrality (SOAP can be used over any transport protocol such as HTTP, SMTP or even TCP, etc.), and (3) Independence (SOAP allows for almost any programming model to be used, etc.)
<br/><br/> LDAP is a software protocol for enabling storage and retrieval of electronic content and other resources such as files and devices on the cloud communications network 18.  LDAP is a "lightweight" version of Directory Access Protocol (DAP), which
is part of X.500, a standard for directory services in a network.  LDAP may be used with X.509 security and other security methods for secure storage and retrieval.  X.509 is public key digital certificate standard developed as part of the X.500
directory specification.  X.509 is used for secure management and distribution of digitally signed certificates across networks.
<br/><br/> An API is a particular set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other.  It serves as an interface between different software programs and facilitates their interaction.
<br/><br/> Bar Codes
<br/><br/> A "barcode" is an optical machine-readable representation of data, which shows data about the object to which it attaches.  Originally, barcodes represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines, and may be referred to as
linear or 1 dimensional (1D).  Later they evolved into rectangles, dots, hexagons and other geometric patterns in 2 dimensions (2D).  Although 2D systems use a variety of symbols, they are generally referred to as barcodes as well.  Barcodes originally
were scanned by special--optical scanners called barcode readers, scanners and interpretive software are available on devices including desktop printers (not illustrated) and smart phones 14 and tablet computers 12.
<br/><br/> Table 4 illustrates exemplary linear barcodes, the standards of all of which are incorporated by reference.  However, the present invention is not limited to the exemplary linear barcodes listed in Table 4, and more fewer and other linear
barcodes can also be used to practice the invention.

<br/><br/> In one specific embodiment, the cloud application 30, 30' interacts with a bar code reader application.  However, the present invention is not limited to a bar code reader application and other applications can also be used to practice the
invention.
<br/><br/> In one specific exemplary embodiment, a QR bar code is used.  However, the present invention is not limited to QR codes and other types of bar codes can also be used to practice the invention
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a block diagram 96 illustrating display of an exemplary QR bar code 98.  The QR bar code 98 in FIG. 6 is a valid QR bar code generated and including the text "This is a QR generated by Zachary C. Lesavich."
<br/><br/> A "QR Code" is a specific matrix barcode (or two-dimensional code), readable by dedicated QR barcode readers and camera phones.  The code consists of black modules arranged in a square pattern on a white background.  The information encoded can
be text, URL or other data.  QR codes are defined in ISO/IEC 18004:2006 Information technology--Automatic identification and data capture techniques--QR Code 2005 bar code symbology specification, 1 Sep. 2006, the contents of which are incorporated by
reference.
<br/><br/> Users with a camera equipped smart phone 14 (or tablet computer 12, etc.) with a the camera component 100, a bar code reader application appropriate for the bar code processes the digital image of the QR Code can include the QR Code 98.  The
camera component 100 is used to capture existing QR codes from print and electronic documents 102 and other sources (e.g., from other network devices, etc.)
<br/><br/> QR codes 98 are also used to display text, contact information, connect to a wireless network, open a web page in the phone's browser, download music, communicate a social event or coupon, or initiate a communications event over the cloud
communications network 18 (e.g., voice call, data call, etc.) This act of linking from physical world objects is known as a "hardlink" or "physical world hyperlinks."
<br/><br/> For example, Google's smart phone Android operating system supports the use of QR codes by natively including the barcode scanner (e.g., Zxing, etc.) on some models, and the browser supports Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) redirection, which
allows QR Codes to send metadata to existing applications on the device.  Nokia's Symbian operating system is also provided with a barcode scanner, which is able to read QR codes, while mbarcode is a QR code reader for the Maemo operating system.  In the
Apple iOS, a QR code reader is not natively included, but hundreds of free applications available with reader and metadata browser URI redirection capability.  However, the present invention is not limited to these network device operating systems and
other bar code readers and device operating systems can also be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a user may scan a number of QR bar codes 98 from non-electronic information such as magazines, business cards, billboards, other non-electronic advertising, etc. A user may also scan a number of QR bar codes 98 from electronic
advertising such from web-sites, other target network devices 12, 14, 16, from e-mails, text messages, instant messages, etc.
<br/><br/> Storing Cloud Objects on Cloud Computing Networks Using Galois Fields
<br/><br/> A "field" is an algebraic object with at least two operations: addition and multiplication.  However, fields do not use ordinary math addition and multiplication.  With field addition all the elements of the field must form a commutative group,
with identity denoted by zero and the inverse of a field element f denoted by -f. For field multiplication all the elements of the field except zero must form another commutative group with identity denoted by one and inverse of f denoted by f.sup.-1. 
The element zero has no inverse under field multiplication.  The distributive identity must also satisfy: a*(b+c)=(a*b)+(a*c), for all field elements a, b, and c.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, finite Galois fields are used.  For any prime integer p and any integer n greater than or equal to one, there is at one unique field with p.sup.n elements in it, denoted GF(p.sup.n).  In the case n is equal to one, the Galois
field is just the integers mod p, in which field addition and field multiplication are just the ordinary math versions followed by taking the remainder on division by p.
<br/><br/> The "modulo" operation determines a remainder of a division of one number by another.  Given two positive numbers, a (i.e., the dividend) and n (i.e., the divisor, a modulo n (i.e., a mod n) is a remainder of a division of a by n.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, p=2 and n=8, so GF(2.sup.8), an 8-bit representation of numbers is used.  This field allows decimal numbers in the range from zero to 255 since 2.sup.8=256.  Elements of GF(p.sup.n) are represented as polynomials of degree
strictly less than n over GF(p).  A polynomial is an expression of finite length constructed from variables and constants and non-negative integer exponents (e.g., x.sup.6+x.sup.4+x+1, etc.).  GF(2.sup.8) is used because 2.sup.8 is an even power of 2 and
8 is the number of bits in a "byte" a term used a common unit of storage in a computer readable medium.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other values of p and n can be used to create Galois fields and to practice the
invention (e.g., GF(3.sup.7), etc.)
<br/><br/> When the p is the prime integer 2, elements of GF(p.sup.n) are expressed as binary numbers, with each term in a polynomial represented by one bit in the corresponding element's binary expression.  This can be represented as a polynomial b(x)
with binary coefficients b {0,1} as b.sup.7x.sup.7+b.sup.6x.sup.6+b.sup.5x.sup.5+b.sup.4x.sup.4+b.sup.3x.sup.- 3+b.sup.2x.sup.2+b.sup.1x+b0.  For example, the following are equivalent representations of the same value in a characteristic 2 finite Galois
field: (Polynomial: x.sup.6+x.sup.4+x+1) is equal to Binary: {01010011}.  Since GF(2.sup.8), there is no x.sup.7, so a zero is placed in the binary, there is an x.sup.6, so a one is placed in the binary, there is no x.sup.5, so a zero is placed in the
binary, there is an x.sup.4, so a one is placed in the binary etc.
<br/><br/> The difficult part of a Galois field is finding the multiplicative inverse of an element, that is, given a non-zero element a in Z.sub.p, finding a.sup.-1.  This is the same as finding b such that a*b % p=1, wherein "%" is the modulus operator.
<br/><br/> Since multiplicative inverses of Galois fields are hard to find, they are often are used in encryption methods (e.g., versions of AES, etc.).  Galois fields are used in the present invention in part to make it difficult to determine locations of
portions of electronic content 13', 15' or a whole portion 13, 15 is distributed to server network device 22, 24, 26 address locations determined using Galois fields.
<br/><br/> Electronic Content Storage with Cloud Computing Networks
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating a Method 104 for storing electronic content with cloud computing.  In FIG. 7A at Step 106, electronic content is received on a first cloud application stored in a first non-transitory computer readable
medium on a cloud server network device with the one or more processors via a cloud communications network comprising: one or more public communication networks, one or more private networks, one or more community networks and one or more hybrid
networks.  At Step 108, the received electronic content is split with the first cloud application into plural portions.  At Step 110, the first cloud application saves the plural potions in plural cloud storage objects.  At Step 112, plural address
locations of selected ones of plural of other different cloud server network devices each with one or more processors are determined with a Galois field.  An input to the Galois field produces an output including an address location of a desired cloud
server on the cloud communications network.  The address location can be located anywhere on the one or more public communication networks, one or more private networks, one or more community networks and one or more hybrid networks of the cloud
communications network.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 7B at Step 114, the determined plural address locations are securely stored in a cloud content location map with the first cloud application in the first non-transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device.  At
Step 116, the plural cloud storage objects are securely sent to the determined selected ones of the plural other different cloud servers on the cloud communications network.  The plural cloud storage objects are distributed and located in plural
different locations on the cloud communications network.  None of the selected ones of plural other cloud server network devices can individually determine locations of all portions of the received electronic content on the cloud communications network,
thereby providing a first layer of security and privacy for the electronic content on the cloud communications network.
<br/><br/> Method 104 is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In such an exemplary embodiment, in FIG. 7A at Step 106, electronic content 13 is received on a first cloud application 30' and stored in a first non-transitory computer readable medium on a cloud server network device (e.g., 20, etc.) with the
one or more processors via a cloud communications network 18 comprising: one or more public communication networks 76, one or more private networks 72, one or more community networks 74 and one or more hybrid networks 78.
<br/><br/> At Step 108, the received electronic content (e.g., 13, etc.) is split with the first cloud application 30' into plural portions (e.g., 13', etc.).
<br/><br/> At Step 110, the first cloud application 30' saves the plural potions 13' in plural cloud storage objects 82.  In one embodiment, one or more QR codes 98 are added to the plural cloud storage objects 82 to uniquely identify a whole portion 13 or
uniquely identify the plural portions 13' of the desired electronic content.  However, the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other identifiers can be used to uniquely identify electronic content 13, 15.
<br/><br/> At Step 112, plural address locations of selected ones of plural of other different cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 each with one or more processors are determined with a Galois field.  An input to the Galois field produces an output
including an address location of a desired cloud server 22, 24 on the cloud communications network.  The address location can be located anywhere on the one or more public communication networks 76, one or more private networks 72, one or more community
networks 74 and one or more hybrid networks 78 of the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> For example, the Galois field produces the output by completing one or more field operations including field addition, field multiplication and field modulus operations on the input to the Galois field as was described above.  However, the
present invention is not limited to such an embodiment, and other field operations can be used on the Galois field to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the Galois field is represented as a set of plural software instructions in the non-transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device 20 and is assessable via and used by the first cloud application 30'.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the Galois field is implemented in hardware or firmware on the cloud server network device 30, or a combination of software, hardware and/or firmware.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, p=2 and n=8, so GF(2.sup.8).  However, the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment, and other values can be used for p and n in GF(p.sup.n).
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, two exemplary polynomials are included in the Galois field GF(2.sup.8).  The choice of polynomials have no effect on field addition operations on the Galois field.  However, the choice of polynomials is relevant for the field
operation of multiplication and provides a modulus for field multiplication operations.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, two exemplary polynomials include, but are not limited to, p.sub.1(x)=x.sup.4+x.sup.3+x+1 and p.sub.2(x)=x.sup.4+1.  The two polynomials are field multiplied together using input data for x. However, the present invention is
not limited to such an embodiment, more, fewer and other polynomials can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> Since Galois fields are very complicated, a simple example, using the Galois Field GF(2.sup.3) and the polynomial P(x)=x.sup.3+x+1 is provided to illustrate the invention.  (The GF(2.sup.8) and p.sub.1(x)=x.sup.4+x.sup.3+x+1 and
p.sub.2(x)=x.sup.4+1 are very complicated and include several hundred entries but are determined in a similar manner to the simple example illustrated in Table 6.).
<br/><br/> The simple exemplary GF(2.sup.3)=GF(8) since two raised to the third power is eight.  A result from the Galois field GF(2.sup.3) is (1011) (binary) is equal to the number (11) (decimal).  Values in GF(2.sup.3) are 3-bits each, spanning the
decimal number range zero through seven.  Galois field multiplication takes place on 3-bit binary values (with modulo two addition, where the two and three are from (2.sup.3) and the result is computed modulo P(x), so the result is (1011) binary which is
equal to the number 11 (decimal).
<br/><br/> Table 6 illustrates exemplary Galois field multiplication and Galois field addition tables used for a very simple Galois Field GF(2.sup.3) with the polynomial P(x)=x.sup.3+x+1.  The results are listed in decimal number format.  (Similar tables
are used to Galois field multiply input values GF(2.sup.8) for p.sub.1(x)=x.sup.4+x.sup.3+x+1 and p.sub.2(x)=x.sup.4+1 to increase output speed for the Galois field operations).
<br/><br/> For example, Table 6 with Galois Field GF(2.sup.3) and P(x)=x.sup.3+x+1, and be used to verify the Galois field multiplication of 5.times.4 as is illustrated in Equation (1).  Multiplication takes place on 3-bit binary values with modulo 2
addition.).  As Table 6, illustrates, the element zero has no inverse and is not used under Galois field multiplication.  5 (decimal).times.4 (decimal)=(101) binary.times.(100) binary=(10100) (1) The results is then computed modulo P(x) as is illustrated
in Equation (2) since the Galois field GF(2.sup.3) is (1011) (binary) or 11 (decimal).  (10100) binary mod (1011) binary=(010) binary=2 (decimal) (2)
<br/><br/> As another example, the Galois field multiplication of 4.times.3=4 (decimal).times.3 (decimal)=(100) binary.times.(011) binary=(1100) binary.  Then (1100) binary mod (1011) binary=(111) binary=7 (decimal).
<br/><br/> In this simple example, Galois field addition takes places on 3-bit binary values using bitwise exclusive OR (XOR), operations.  A "bitwise XOR" operation takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs a logical exclusive OR operation on
each pair of corresponding bits.  The result in each position is one if only the first bit is one or only the second bit is one, but will be zero if both bits are zero or both bits are one.  In the comparison of two bits, if the two bits are different
the XOR result is a one, and the XOR result is a zero if they are the same.
<br/><br/> Table 6 can be also used to verify the Galois field GF(2.sup.3) addition of 5+4=(101) XOR (100)=(001)=1 (decimal).  Note, however, as was discussed above, the choice of the polynomial P(x) plays no role in the Galois Field addition operation.

<br/><br/> For additional security and privacy, the values for p and n and the two (or more) polynomials are periodically changed in the Galois field.  The corresponding instructions and tables, etc. are replaced in the non-transitory computer readable
medium on the cloud server network device 20.  In such an embodiment, new tables of Galois Field output numbers are calculated and stored in the computer readable medium on the cloud server network device 20.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, field multiplication in GF(2.sup.8) includes multiplying data for the two polynomials modulo using an irreducible polynomial of degree eight (e.g., p(x)=x.sup.8+x.sup.4+x.sup.3+x+1, etc.).  Such an irreducible polynomial
provides an additional level of security for use of the Galois field.  However, the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other polynomials can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the input is to the Galois field is a sequence of binary digits (i.e., ones and zeros) obtained from two or more random numbers from a random number generator accessible by the first cloud application 30' (e.g., if the decimal
number 176 is obtained from the random number generator, then binary number 10110000 (since 176 (decimal) is equal to 10110000 (binary)) is input to the Galois field, etc.).  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other
types of inputs can be used as inputs to the Galois field including pre-determined sequences of numbers, prime numbers, digitized user encoded biometrics, tables of selected numbers, etc.
<br/><br/> "Biometrics" are patterns derived from physical features (e.g., fingerprints, iris patterns scanned from an eye, facial scan patterns, etc.) or emissions (e.g., voice patterns, DNA samples, hair samples blood samples, etc.) of a human body.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the biometric information is included in binary bit patterns and run through a encryption method (e.g., AES, DES, MD5, etc.).  Biometric encryption methods securely bind a digital key to a biometric, or extract a key from the
biometric.  Neither the key nor the biometric can be retrieved from a stored biometric template.  The key is re-created only if a correct biometric sample is presented on verification.  An output of biometric encryption is verification that either a key
is correct or incorrect.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the input to the Galois field produces an output including a virtual cloud communication network addresses, an Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or a Medium Access Control (MAC) address and/or a TCP and/or a UDP and/or other
protocol port designation and/or combinations thereof.  However, the present invention is not limited to such address location and other address locations can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the virtual cloud communication network addresses include virtual addresses of cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 located anywhere on the cloud communications network 18.  However, the present invention is not limited to
such an embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.  In such an embodiment, the virtual cloud communication network addresses include, for example, virtual designations, for example, as cloud_server_1_private_network_1, cloud
server_2_public_network_3, etc. (e.g., Table 7, 8, etc.) However, the present invention is not limited to such notation and other notation can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> Table 7 illustrates exemplary address locations for plural cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 on the plural networks 72, 74, 76, 78 on the cloud network 18 based on the field multiplication values from the Galois Filed outputs of Table 6. 
Address locations are illustrated with exemplary virtual addresses, IP addresses, MAC (data link) addresses and UDP port addresses and combinations therefore for cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 for simplicity.  However, the present invention is
not limited to such an embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00007 TABLE 7 GF(2.sup.3) with polynomial P(x) = x.sup.3 + x + 1 Field multiplication and addition output values Cloud Network Server Address Location 1 cloud_server_1_private_network_1 2 cloud_server_2_public_network_3 3

<br/><br/> The address location column of Table 7 is periodically changed to provide additional security and privacy.  Individual address locations from a list of address locations of cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 are selected using a random
number generator.  The output from the random number generator is used to add the individual address locations into a row and column in Table 7.  However, the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other embodiments can be used to
practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the output from the Galois field includes a number which is used to reference a location in an address location table (e.g., Table 7, etc.).  However, the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other
embodiments, including or not including tables can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, another input used for the Galois field is physical location information of the target network device 12, 14, 16.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the physical location information includes Global Positioning System (GPS) information, street address information, two-dimensional (2D) geo-space (e.g., X, Y) (e.g., building, floor), three-dimensional (3D) (X, Y, Z) (e.g.,
building, floor, floor location (e.g., room, office, desk, etc.)) or other physical location information (e.g., longitude, latitude, street address, etc.).  However, the present invention is not limited to such physical location information and other
physical location information can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) that provides reliable location and time information in all weather and at all times and anywhere on or near the Earth.  A GPS receiver calculates its
position by precisely timing signals sent by GPS satellites.  A GPS receiver uses the messages it receives to determine a transit time of each message and computes a distance to each GPS satellite.  These distances along with the satellites' locations
are used with the possible aid of triangulation, depending on which algorithm is used, to compute a current physical position of the GPS receiver.  This position is then displayed, perhaps with a moving map display (e.g., at a street level, etc.) and/or
latitude and longitude and/or elevation and/or speed and/or acceleration information may also be included.  Many GPS units also show derived information such as travel direction and speed, calculated from position changes.  The GPS coordinates include
standard GPS, GPS map, Digital GPS (DGPS) and/or other types of GPS information.
<br/><br/> In such embodiments, the output from the Galois field includes address locations of selected ones of the plural of other cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 that are physically closest to the target network device 12, 14, 16 requesting the
desired electronic content.  In such an embodiment, the desired electronic content is delivered faster to the target network device 12, 14, 16, the servers 22, 24, 26 used to store portions of the desired electronic content are physically close to the
target network device 12, 14, 16.  One reason faster delivery can occur is that a wireless and/or wired communication is faster when a communications is stronger.  Stronger signals occur when a network device is closer to a signal source.  However, the
present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> The various embodiments have been described with Galois fields using decimal numbers.  However, decimal number were only used to make it easier for person skilled in the art to understand the invention.  In an actual implementation of the
invention on a cloud computing network 18, one or more processors on the cloud target network device 20 executes the cloud application 30' and the methods described herein as a series of instructions in a non-transitory computer readable medium. 
Therefore the Galois filed would directly use binary representations for all inputs and outputs of the Galois field and conversions to and from decimal numbers would not be necessary as the inputs and outputs need not be in human readable form for the
one or more processors.
<br/><br/> Galois fields are also used because operations used on the Galois fields are native to network device processors and internal hardware, such as shift left for multiplication, shift right for division, logical AND, OR, XOR, etc. Galois fields can
be implemented in hardware as a series of logic gates.
<br/><br/> Returning to FIG. 7B at Step 114, the determined plural address locations are securely stored in a cloud content location map 17 with the first cloud application 30' in the first non-transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server
network device 20.  In another embodiment, the cloud content location map 17 is stored in a secure database 20' associated with the cloud server network device 20.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and types of storage can
be used to store the cloud content location map.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the cloud content location map 17 is encrypted using a Discrete Logarithm Integrated Encryption Scheme (DLIES), an Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECI ES), a user generated biometric or a Homomorphic encryption
method.  These encryption methods are used because they can be used efficiently and quickly with Galois fields.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other encryption methods described herein can be used to encrypt the
cloud content location map.
<br/><br/> At Step 116, the plural cloud storage objects 82 are securely sent to the determined selected ones of the plural other different cloud servers 22, 24, 26 on the cloud communications network 18.  The plural cloud storage objects 82 are
distributed and located in a plural different locations on the cloud communications network 18.  None of the selected ones of plural other cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 can individually determine locations of all portions of the received
electronic content on the cloud communications network 18, thereby providing a first layer of security and privacy for the electronic content on the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the plural cloud storage objects are securely sent using a Wireless Encryption Protocol (WEP), Wireless-Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), Robust Security Network (RSN), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard
(DES), Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Message Digest-5 (MD-5), Electronic Code Book (ECB), Diffie and Hellman (DH), HyperText Transport Protocol Secure, (HTTPs), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security
(TLS) security method, Discrete Logarithm Integrated Encryption Scheme (DLI ES), a Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECI ES), biometric or a Homomorphic encryption method.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and
other encryption methods described herein can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, Method 104 is used without splitting the received electronic content into plural portions.  In such an embodiment, a whole portion of the received electronic content 13 is copied by the first cloud application 30' into a
single cloud storage object 82.  The Galois filed is used to determine an address location of a single cloud server network device 22, 24, 26 on the networks 72, 74, 76, 78 that comprise the cloud network 18.  The single cloud storage object 82 is sent
to the address location of that cloud network server device.  When the desired electronic content is requested, the whole portion of the electronic content 13 is returned and removed from the cloud storage object 82 and sent to the target network device
12.
<br/><br/> Electronic Content Retrieval with Cloud Computing Networks with Galois Fields
<br/><br/> FIGS. 8A, 8B and 8C are a flow diagram illustrating a Method 118 for providing electronic content retrieval with cloud computing.  At Step 120, a first request message is received in real-time on the first cloud application stored on the cloud
server network device with the one or more processors from a second cloud application stored in a second non-transitory computer readable medium on a target network device with one or more processors via the cloud communications network.  The first
request message includes a request for desired cloud electronic content stored in the plural cloud storage objects stored on the selected ones of the plural other different cloud server network devices located on one or more of the networks comprising
the cloud communications network.  The plural different cloud storage objects function as a single secure storage object for electronic content on the cloud communications network.  At Step 122, the cloud content location map is retrieved securely on the
first cloud application on the cloud server network device.  The cloud content location map includes address locations of the selected ones of the plural other different cloud server network devices on the cloud communications network.  In FIG. 8B at
Step 124, the first cloud application on the cloud server network device sends plural second request messages for the desired cloud electronic content to the selected ones of the plural other different cloud server network devices identified in the
retrieved cloud content location map and located on one or more of the public communication networks, the one or more private networks, community networks and hybrid networks comprising the cloud communications network.  At Step 126, the cloud computing
application on the server network device receives plural response messages including one or more individual portions of the desired cloud electronic content stored in plural cloud storage objects from the selected ones of the plural other different cloud
server network devices on the public communication network, the one or more private networks, community networks and hybrid networks comprising the cloud communications network.  At Step 128, the first cloud application on the first server network device
combines the one or more individual components of the desired cloud electronic content from the plural cloud storage objects from the received plural response messages into a final desired electronic cloud content component.  In FIG. 8C at Step 130, the
first cloud application on the cloud server network device securely sends in real-time the final desired cloud electronic content component as the request desired cloud electronic content to the target network device via the cloud communications network. The second cloud application on the target network device cannot determine the desired cloud electronic content was split and was stored in plural cloud storage objects and cannot determine which of plural selected ones of the other different cloud
server network devices on which ones of the public, private, community or hybrid networks on the cloud communications network may have stored portions of the final desired cloud electronic content, thereby providing a second and/or fourth layer of
security and privacy for the desired cloud electronic content on the cloud communications network.
<br/><br/> Method 118 is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In such an exemplary embodiment, in FIG. 8A at Step 120, a first request message is received in real-time on the first cloud application 30' stored in the first non-transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device 20 with
the one or more processors from a second cloud application 30 stored in a second non-transitory computer readable medium on a target network device (e.g. 12, etc.) with one or more processors via the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> The first request message includes a request for desired cloud electronic content 13 stored in the plural cloud storage objects 82 stored on the selected ones of the plural other different cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 located on one
or more of the networks 72, 74, 76, 78, comprising the cloud communications network 18.  The plural different cloud storage objects 82' function as a single, transparent secure storage object 82 for electronic content on the cloud communications network
18.
<br/><br/> In this embodiment, "real-time" includes a time period of a few seconds (e.g., one to five seconds etc.), or less in elapsed time.  That is, from a first time a request message is received until the desired electronic content is delivered, a few
seconds of actual time elapse.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other time periods for real-time can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the first request message includes a QR bar code 98.  In another embodiment, the first request message is encrypted with a pre-determined encryption method, including those described herein and others and encoded into the QR
bar code 98.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In such an embodiment, any electronic content stored is given a unique QR bar code 98 or RFID tag 99.  When the desired electronic content is desired the QR code 98 and/or RFID tag 99 is used to request and retrieve the desired electronic
content.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the first request message includes login information for one or more television sites, social networking sites, music distribution sites.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other
embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> At Step 122, the cloud content location map 17 is retrieved securely on the first cloud application 30' on the cloud server network device 20.  The cloud content location map 17 includes location addresses of the selected ones of the plural
other different cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 on the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 8B at Step 124, first cloud application 30' on the cloud server network device 20 sends plural second request messages for the desired cloud electronic content to the selected ones of the plural other different cloud server network
devices 22, 24, 26 identified in the retrieved cloud content location map and located on the one or more public communication networks 76, the one or more private networks 72, community networks 78 and hybrid networks 78 comprising the cloud
communications network 18.
<br/><br/> At Step 126, the cloud computing application 30' on the server network device 20 receives plural response messages including one or more individual portions of the desired cloud electronic content 13' in one or more of cloud storage objects 82
from the selected ones of the plural other different cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 on the public communication networks 76, the one or more private networks 72, community networks 74 and hybrid networks 78 comprising the cloud communications
network 18.
<br/><br/> At Step 128, the first cloud application 30' on the first server network device 20 combines the one or more individual components of the desired cloud electronic content 13' from the one or more cloud storage objects 82 from the received plural
response messages into a final desired electronic cloud content component 13.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 8C at Step 130, the first cloud application 30' on the cloud server network device 20 securely sends in real-time the final desired cloud electronic content component as the desired cloud electronic content 13 to the target network
device 12 via the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> The second cloud application 30 on the target network device 12 cannot determine the desired cloud electronic content 13 was stored as plural portions 13 in plural cloud storage objects 82' and cannot determine which of plural selected ones of
the other different cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 on the one or more public 76, private 72, community 74 or hybrid networks 78 on the cloud communications network 18 may have stored portions 13' of the final desired cloud electronic content 13,
thereby providing a second layer of security and privacy for the desired cloud electronic content on the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, as was described above a whole portion 13 of the desired cloud electronic content can be requested by the target network device 12, and returned to the target network device 12 from the cloud server network device 20 after
the desired cloud electronic 13 is retrieved as a whole portion 13 stored in 82 from another cloud server network device 22, 23, 24 on one or the networks 72, 74, 76, 78 of the cloud network 18.
<br/><br/> The desired cloud electronic content 13 can be requested from the cloud communications network 18 and displayed by the second cloud application 30' on the target network device 12, 14, 16 anywhere the target network device 12 is physically
located near and/or in communications with any server network devices 22, 24, 26 on any of the networks 72, 74, 76, 78 on the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> Redundant Electronic Content Storage with Cloud Computing Networks with Galois Fields
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a flow diagram illustrating a Method 132 for storing electronic content with cloud computing.  At Step 134, the first cloud application on the cloud server network device sends plural third request messages to the selected ones of the
plural other different cloud server network devices identified in the retrieved cloud content location map to de-activate the plural portions of desired cloud electronic content stored in the plural cloud storage objects stored on the selected ones of
the plural other different cloud server network devices.  At Step 136, the first cloud application determines new plural address locations of new selected ones of plural other different cloud server network devices each with one or more processors with
the Galois field.  At Step 138, the first cloud application securely stores the determined new plural address locations in the cloud content location map with the first cloud application in the first non-transitory computer readable medium on the cloud
server network device.  At Step 140, the first cloud application securely send the retrieved plural cloud storage objects to the new determined selected ones of the plural other different cloud servers on the cloud communications network with the
determined plural address locations.  The plural cloud storage objects are distributed and located in a new plural different locations on one or more public, private, community or hybrid networks on the cloud communications network.
<br/><br/> Method 132 is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> At Step 134, the first cloud application 30' on the cloud server network device 20 sends plural third request messages to the selected ones of the plural of other different cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 identified in the retrieved
cloud content location map 17 to de-activate the plural portions 13' of desired cloud electronic content stored 13 in the plural cloud storage objects 82 stored on the selected ones of the plural other different cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26.
<br/><br/> De-activating the plural portions 13' of the desired cloud electronic content 13 stored in the plural cloud storage objects 82 includes encrypting the plural cloud storage objects 82 or deleting the plural cloud storage objects 82.
<br/><br/> If the plural cloud storage objects 82 are encrypted, they can be decrypted at a later time for retrieval.  If the plural storage objects 82 are deleted, then they cannot be retrieved from the same server network devices without re-storing the
plural cloud storage objects 82.  However, the present invention is not limited to such embodiments other can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, if the plural cloud storage objects 82 are encrypted (e.g., with a public or private encryption key for AES, DES, RSN, DLIES, ECIES, etc.) when subsequent requests for the desired electronic content 13 are made by the target
network device 12, one or more of the encrypted plural cloud storage objects 82 on cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 that are closest to a physical location of the target network device 12 are decrypted (e.g., with a corresponding public or private
decryption key, etc.) and sent to the cloud network server 20 for processing.
<br/><br/> This increases the efficiency and speed of electronic content delivery on the cloud communications network 18.  In such an embodiment, the plural cloud storage objects 82 are duplicated and distributed in plural different locations on the cloud
communications network, thereby providing an additional layer of redundancy and fault tolerance on the cloud network 18.
<br/><br/> "Fault tolerance" is a system design feature that enables a system to continue operation, possibly at a reduced level (also known as graceful degradation), rather than failing completely, when some part of the system fails or goes off-line.  The
cloud communications network defined herein is a fault tolerant network.  "Redundancy" is a duplication of critical components or functions or data storage of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the system.
<br/><br/> For example, if a first cloud network server 22 including a first cloud storage object 82 with a first portion 13' of desired electronic content failed or was taken off-line, a second cloud network server 24 including an encrypted copy of the
first cloud storage object 82 and the same first portion 13' of the desired electronic content could be decrypted and sent to the cloud server network device 20 for processing.
<br/><br/> At Step 136, the first cloud application 30' determines new plural address locations of new selected ones of plural other different cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 each with one or more processors with the Galois field.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the input to the Galois field includes physical location information of the target network device 12 and the output of the Galois field includes new plural address locations of new selected ones of the plural other different
cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 which are the closest to a current physical location of the target network device 12.  However, the present invention is not limited to such embodiments other can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> At Step 138, the first cloud application 30' securely stores the determined new plural address locations in the cloud content location map 17 with the first cloud application 30' in the first non-transitory computer readable medium on the cloud
server network device 20.
<br/><br/> At Step 140, the first cloud application 30' securely sends the retrieved plural cloud storage objects to the new determined selected ones of the plural other different cloud servers 22, 22, 26 on the cloud communications network 18 with the
determined plural address locations.  The plural cloud storage objects 82 are re-distributed and located in new plural different locations on one or more public 76, private 72, community 74 or hybrid networks 78 on the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment a request for stored electronic content triggers the de-activation of the stored electronic content.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment the first cloud application 30' automatically periodically retrieves the cloud content storage map and retrieves plural cloud storage objects for stored electronic content.  Method 132 is then executed to periodically
de-activate stored electronic content and re-distribute it and re-store to other networks 72, 74, 76, 78 on the cloud communications network 18.  This automatic execution helps make the cloud network 18 more fault tolerant and provides redundancy of
stored electronic content.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, as was described above for storing a whole portion 13, the cloud storage object 82 including the whole portion 13 of the desired cloud electronic content can be de-activated with encryption.  The cloud storage object 82
including the whole portion 13 of the desired electronic content is then sent to a new cloud server network device 22, 24, 26 for storage in a new, different location one of the networks, 72, 74, 76, 78 on the cloud network 18.
<br/><br/> The methods and systems described herein provide for electronic content storage and retrieval on cloud computing networks.  The electronic content is divided into plural portions and stored in plural cloud storage objects.  Storage locations for
the plural cloud storage objects are selected using a Galois field and the plural cloud storage objects are distributed to various locations across the cloud network.  When the electronic content is requested, the plural portions are retrieved and
transparently combined back into the original electronic content.  No server network devices storing the plural cloud storage objects can individually determine locations of all portions of the electronic content on the cloud communications network,
thereby providing a first layer of security and privacy for the electronic content on the cloud communications network.  No target network devices requesting the electronic content can determine where the electronic content is stored, thereby providing a
second layer of security and privacy for the electronic content on the cloud communications network.
<br/><br/> Information Entropy
<br/><br/> "Information theory" is a branch of applied mathematics, electrical engineering and computer science involving the quantification of information.  Since its inception information theory has been used for data analysis.
<br/><br/> Information theory is generally considered to have been invented in 1948 by Claude Shannon in his seminal work, "A Mathematical Theory of Communication," Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 27, pp.  379-423, 623-656, July, October, 1948, the
contents of which is incorporated by reference.  The central paradigm of classical information theory is the engineering problem of the transmission of information over a "noisy" channel.
<br/><br/> The most fundamental results of this theory are Shannon's source coding theorem, which establishes that, on average, the number of bits (i.e., ones and zeros) needed to represent the result of an uncertain event is given by its entropy; and
Shannon's noisy-channel coding theorem, which states that reliable communication is possible over noisy channels provided that the rate of communication is below a certain threshold called the "channel capacity." The channel capacity can be approached in
practice by using appropriate encoding and decoding systems.
<br/><br/> In information theory, "mutual information" of two random variables is a quantity that measures the mutual dependence of the two random variables.  The most common unit of measurement of mutual information is the bit, when logarithms to the base
2 are used.
<br/><br/> "Information Entropy" is a concept from information theory.  It is a measure of uncertainty.  It tells how much information there is in an event.  In general, the more uncertain or random the event is, the more information it will contain.  A
key measure of information theory is "entropy," which is usually expressed by the average number of bits needed for storage or communication.
<br/><br/> In information theory information entropy is similar to randomness.  A string of random English letters is said to have high information entropy, in other words large amounts of entropy.  However, the complete works of Edgar Allan Poe, by
contrast, have lower information entropy, because when forming meaningful words certain combinations of letters are more likely to occur than others.
<br/><br/> One method of information theory used for data analysis is what Claude E. Shannon described as "Communication Without Noise." Shannon noted that the English language seems to be about 50% meaningless syntax, letters and phrasing.
<br/><br/> In such an embodiment, as the original electronic messages are received, the message are translated into binary and a "stochastic process" is used to process the messages.
<br/><br/> The "stochastic process" is a process that creates an "average message" in terms of probabilities of various patterns of English letters occurring.  Shannon defined a measure of information content I(m) called the "self-information" of a
received message m as is illustrated by Equation (3): I(m)=-log.sub.p(m), (3) where p(m)=P.sub.r(M=m) is the probability that message m is chosen from all possible choices in the message space M.
<br/><br/> Electronic content received on a cloud application includes a total message space (M) and individual portions of the electronic content include individual received messages s(m).
<br/><br/> Equation (3) causes messages with lower probabilities to contribute more to the overall value of information I(m).  In other words, infrequently occurring messages are more valuable and frequently occurring messages are less valuable.
<br/><br/> For example in English if a letter "q" appears in a word you can be almost certain it is followed by a letter "u" (e.g., quack, quadrant, quick, etc.) because virtually all words in English that start with the letter "q" have a second letter
including the letter "u." This provides very little self-information and such words starting with "qu" are easier to derive by examining only a few formative letters.
<br/><br/> However, if the letter "q" in a word, followed by a letter "i" for the word "qintar" provides a large amount of information because virtually no words in the English language in the two letters "qi." This provides a large amount of
self-information and such words are more difficult to derive by examining only a few formative letters.
<br/><br/> The stochastic process is also valid for short-hand syntax used in IM, SMS, etc. For example, a user of a target network device 12, 14, 16, may encode the message "talk to you at 3 o'clock" as "tk 2 u @ 3 oclk" and so on.  The stochastic process
used herein properly handles such translations from portions of short-hand syntax to whole English words.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, information entropies of a pre-determined alphabet with a pre-determined set of symbols is used to split received original electronic content using Equation (3).  However, the present invention is not limited to this
embodiment and other embodiments and other methods used to determine information entropies can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> The stochastic process is also used to provide an additional layer of security and privacy by splitting electronic information into plural pieces to prevent "information gain" based on information entropy and/or mutual information, that may be
determined by a third-party eavesdropping on the electronic content received and stored with the methods and systems described herein.
<br/><br/> For example, entropy probabilities for two portions of electronic information (x) and (y) that will be examined and/or compared is illustrated by Equation (4): Entropy=p(x)*log(p(x))-p(y)*log(p(y)) (4) wherein log( ) is used with base 2, 3, 4, . . . 10, .  . . etc.
<br/><br/> By examining entropies, a measure of information gain, or how much information can be gained by eavesdropping and/or view the plural portions of the electronic content, is determined.  Equation (5) illustrates information gain: Information
gain=Entropy_before-Entropy_after (5)
<br/><br/> The calculations from Equations (3) through (5) are done for each portion (m) of the electronic content over the whole electronic content (M).  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments, with
different equations can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the portions with the largest information gain are chosen to split into two or more smaller separate portions and stored in two or more separate locations on the cloud network using the Galois field.  In another embodiment,
the portions with the smallest information gain are chosen to combine into one larger portion.  In another embodiment, the portions with the largest information gains are chosen to combine into one larger portion.  However, the present invention is not
limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> For any probability distribution entropy is extended to define mutual information, which is a measure of an amount of information one random variable includes about another.  Entropy then becomes the self-information (e.g., Equation (3), etc.)
of a random variable (X) or (Y).  Mutual information is a special case of a more general quantity called relative entropy, which is a measure of a distance between two probability distributions of information.
<br/><br/> Equation (6) illustrates calculation of mutual information I(X; Y) probability values of two discrete random variables X and Y obtained from selected portions m.sub.X and m.sub.Y of the received of the received electronic content (M):
<br/><br/> .function..di-elect cons..times..di-elect cons..times..function..times..function..function..function..times..functi- on.  ##EQU00001## where p(x,y) is a joint probability distribution function of X and Y, and p(x) and p(y) are marginal
probability distribution functions of X and Y respectively.
<br/><br/> In the case of continuous (instead of discrete) random variables X and Y, the summation in Equation (6) is replaced by a definite double integral, where p(x,y) is instead a joint probability density function function of X and Y, and p(x) and
p(y) are marginal probability distribution functions of X and Y respectively.
<br/><br/> Mutual information is also a concern when storing electronic content.  "Mutual information" measures information that X and Y share: it measures how much knowing one of these variables reduces uncertainty about the other.  For example, if X and
Y are independent, then knowing X does not give any information about Y and vice versa, so their mutual information is zero.  At the other extreme, if X and Y are identical then all information conveyed by X is shared with Y. Knowing X determines the
value of Y and vice versa.  As a result, in the case of identity the mutual information is the same as the uncertainty contained in Y (or X) alone, namely the entropy of Y or X Clearly if X and Y are identical they have equal entropy.
<br/><br/> If an entropy of (X) is regarded as a measure of uncertainty about a random variable (X), then (X|Y) is a measure of what (Y) does not say about (X).  This is, the amount of uncertainty remaining about X after Y is known, and thus the amount of
uncertainty in X, minus the amount of uncertainty in X which remains after Y is known.  This is equivalent to the amount of uncertainty in X which is removed by knowing Y. Thus, the general meaning of mutual information includes an amount of information
(that is, reduction in uncertainty) that knowing either variable (X) or (Y) provides about the other.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the mutual information of two discrete random variables (X) and (Y) is used as a measure of the mutual dependence of the two random variables.  The most common unit of measurement of mutual information is the bit.  In such an
embodiment, a bit can only include a value zero or one, so log base 2 (e.g., log.sub.2) is used in Equations (3) through (6).
<br/><br/> The techniques illustrated in Equations (3) through (6) are exemplary only.  The present invention is not limited by these exemplary equations.  More, fewer and/or other types of equations, entropy and/or information gain/sharing, and/or mutual
information processes can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> For example, if a first portion X as m.sub.X of electronic content (M) included the English text from U.S.  President Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg address speech: "For score and seven years ago," and a second portion Y as m.sub.Y included
the English text "our fathers brought forth on this continent," the exact next phrase in the speech, then the mutual dependence and mutual information between X and Y is very high (i.e., a probability that X is dependent on Y is very high).  So if X were
stored in one location on the cloud communications network and Y in another an eavesdropper could easily reconstruct the original text by searching the next phrase in the speech.  etc. The eavesdropper may be able to eventually determine, based on the
original text of the speech, how the electronic content was actually split up and stored (e,g., a Galois field was used, inputs to the Galois field, etc.) on the cloud communications network based on information entropy of mutual information and
information gain.
<br/><br/> However, if a first portion X as m.sub.X "For score and seven years ago," and a second portion Y as m.sub.Y included the English text "all men are created equal"then the mutual information arid information gain obtained by using X and Y is much
lower than in the first example.  Even though the English text of Y as m.sub.Y appears in the Gettysburg address as the last five words of line one, it also appears in a huge number of other documents (e,g., the U.S, Constitution, etc,), speeches (e.g.,
Dr, Martin Luther King's speeches, etc.), books, articles, etc. So in this second example, if X were stored in one location on the cloud communications network and Y in another an eavesdropper would have a much hard time to eventually determine based on
the electronic content was split up and stored (e.g., a Galois field was used, inputs to the Galois field, etc.) on the cloud communications network based on information entropy of mutual information and information gain.
<br/><br/> The examples used are illustrative only and not intended to limit the scope of the invention.
<br/><br/> The methods and systems described herein used to split and store portions of electronic content to reduce eavesdropping by observing mutual information and information gain.
<br/><br/> The examples used herein are simple examples used for illustrative purposes and do not limit the invention.  The invention is not limited to the English language and/or symbols (e.g. letters, etc.) in the English alphabet, and other languages,
with other alphabets and/or symbols can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> These examples above assume the original text of the electronic content is stored as plain-text arid not encrypted, etc. However, the same type of mutual information and information gain attacks can be used for encrypted information as well.
<br/><br/> Information theory and the stochastic process concepts apply to cryptography and cryptanalysis as well.  When plaintext is encrypted with many of the encryption methods described herein using an encryption key (e.g., RSA, DES, AES, etc.), some
mutual information exists between the plaintext and ciphertext.  Any positive conditional mutual information between plaintext and ciphertext (conditioned on an encryption key) can subject the ciphertext to attack by analyzing any conditional mutual
information discovered while examining transmission of ciphertext over a period of time.
<br/><br/> Problems occur when such mutual information can be gathered in real-time as the ciphertext is transmitted.  Mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext can be used to break an encryption scheme.  However, the practical consideration
is how long it will take.  Even with using plural powerful computing devices, it may take several hundred or thousands of years to defeat an encryption scheme, which is not useful or practical to provide any value.
<br/><br/> When any positive conditional mutual information exits between the plaintext and the ciphertext, an eavesdropper could improve his or her guess of the plaintext by gaining knowledge of the ciphertext but not of the key.
<br/><br/> If there is no or very little mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext absolutely secure communications may result.  In other words, an eavesdropper would not be able to improve his or her guess of the plaintext by gaining
knowledge of the ciphertext but not of the key.
<br/><br/> One-time pads (OTPs) are one example of "information-theoretically secure" cryptography such that an encrypted message (i.e., the ciphertext) provides no information about the original message (i.e., the plainext) to a cryptanalyst, except the
maximum possible length of the message.
<br/><br/> However, the theoretical perfect security of the one-time-pad applies only in a theoretically perfect setting.  No real-world implementation of any cryptosystem can provide perfect security because practical considerations introduce potential
vulnerabilities.  These practical considerations of security and convenience have meant that the one-time-pad is, in practice, little-used.  Implementation difficulties have led to one-time pad systems being broken, and are so serious that they have
prevented the one-time pad from being adopted as a widespread tool in information security.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, both Galois fields and information entropy are used to provide security and privacy for storage and retrieval of electronic content on a cloud communications network.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 10A, 10B and 10C are a flow diagram illustrating a Method 142 for storing electronic content with cloud computing using Galois fields and information entropy.  In FIG. 10A at Step 144, electronic content is received on a first cloud
application and stored in a first non-transitory computer readable medium on a cloud server network device with the one or more processors via a cloud communications network comprising: one or more public communication networks, one or more private
networks, one or more community networks and one or more hybrid networks.  At Step 146, the first cloud application determines a set of plural information entropy probabilities for a pre-determined set of symbols for a pre-determined alphabet on first
plural portions of the received electronic content.  At Step 148, the received electronic content is split by the first cloud application into second plural portions based on a selected set of information entropy probabilities from the determined set of
plural information entropies with the first cloud application, thereby providing a first level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content based on the determined plural information entropies.  At Step 150, the first cloud
application saves the second plural potions in a plural cloud storage objects.  In FIG. 10B at Step 152, the first cloud application determines plural address locations of selected ones of plural other different cloud server network devices each with one
or more processors are determined with a Galois field.  An input to the Galois field produces an output including an address location of a desired cloud server on the cloud communications network.  The address location can be located anywhere on the one
or more public communication networks, one or more private networks, one or more community networks and one or more hybrid networks of the cloud communications network.  At Step 154, the determined plural address locations are securely stored in a cloud
content location map with the first cloud application in the first non-transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device.  In FIG. 10C at Step 156, the first cloud application securely sends the plural cloud storage objects to the
determined selected ones of the plural other different cloud servers on the cloud communications network with the determined plural address locations, thereby providing a second level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content
based on use of the Galois field.  The plural cloud storage objects are distributed and located in a plural different locations on the cloud communications network.  None of the selected ones of plural other cloud server network devices can individually
determine locations of all portions of the received electronic content on the cloud communications network, thereby providing a third level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content on the cloud communications network.
<br/><br/> Method 142 is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In such an exemplary embodiment at In FIG. 10A at Step 144, electronic content 13,15 is received on a first cloud application 30 and stored in a first non-transitory computer readable medium on a cloud server network device 20 with the one or
more processors via a cloud communications network 18 comprising: one or more public communication networks 76, one or more private networks 72, one or more community networks 74 and one or more hybrid networks 78.
<br/><br/> At Step 146, the first cloud application 30' determines a set of plural information entropy probabilities on first plural portions of the received electronic content 13, 15.  In one embodiment, the first cloud application 30' determines the set
of information entropy probabilities using Equation (3).  In another embodiment, the first cloud application 30' determines the set of information entropy probabilities using Equations (3) through (6).  However, the present invention is not limited to
these embodiments and more, fewer and/or other types of methods can be used to determine the set of plural information entropy probabilities.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, first cloud application 30' determines a set of plural information entropy probabilities based on a set of symbols in a pre-determined alphabet.  For example, the set of symbols include the letters a-z and A-Z, punctuation
characters and/or keyboard characters (e.g., @, #, $, %, etc.).  in the English alphabet, the set of symbols includes American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) symbols for an ASCII encoded binary alphabet (see, e.g., RFC 4880), the set
of symbols includes the numbers zero through 15 and the characters a-f and A-F for a hexadecimal alphabet, the set of symbols includes electronic word abbreviations (e.g., LOL for laughing out loud, U for you, UR for your, @ for at, etc.) for a text
messaging alphabet, the set of symbols includes zero through seven for an octal alphabet, the set of symbols includes the number zero and one for a binary alphabet, the set of symbols includes QR bar codes 98 for a QR bar code alphabet and/or other bar
code alphabet (e.g., Tables 4 and 5, etc.), the set of symbols includes a plaintext and/or the cipher text for an encryption method and/or a security method, etc. However, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments and more, fewer and/or
other types of alphabets, languages (e.g., Spanish French, German, Chinese, Japanese, etc.), symbols, etc. can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> The examples used herein are simple examples used for illustrative purposes and do not limit the invention.  The invention is also not limited to the English language and/or symbols, in the English alphabet, and other languages, with other
alphabets and/or symbols can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> At Step 148, the received electronic content 13, 15 is split by the first cloud application 30' into second plural portions based on a selected set of information entropy probabilities from the determined set of plural information entropies with
the first cloud application 30', thereby providing a first level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content based on the determined plural information entropies.
<br/><br/> At Step 150, the first cloud application 30' saves the second plural potions in a plural cloud storage objects 82.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 10B at Step 152, the first cloud application 30' determines plural address locations of selected ones of plural other different cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 each with one or more processors are determined with a Galois field. 
An input to the Galois field produces an output including an address location of a desired cloud server on the cloud communications network.  The address location can be located anywhere on the one or more public communication networks 76, one or more
private networks 72, one or more community networks 74 and one or more hybrid networks 78 of the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> At Step 154, the determined plural address locations are securely stored in a cloud content location map 17 with the first cloud application 30' in the first non-transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device 20.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 10C at Step 156, the first cloud application 30' securely sends the plural cloud storage objects 13'/82, 15'/82 to the determined selected ones of the plural other different cloud servers 22, 24, 26 on the cloud communications network 18
with the determined plural address locations, thereby providing a second level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content based on use of the Galois field.  The plural cloud storage objects 13'/82, 15'/82 are distributed and
located in a plural different locations on the cloud communications network 18.  None of the selected ones of plural other cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 can individually determine locations of all portions of the received electronic content on
the cloud communications network, thereby providing a third level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content on the cloud communications network.
<br/><br/> After executing Method 142, the original electronic content 13, 15 is requested and returned to a target network device 12, 14, 16 from the first cloud application 30' on the cloud server network device 20 on the cloud communications network 18
using Methods 118 (FIG. 8) described above.  However, at Step 130 of Method 118, since the second cloud application 30 on the target network device 12, 14, 16 cannot determine the desired original cloud electronic content 13, 15 was stored as plural
portions 13,15 in plural cloud storage objects 82' and cannot determine which of plural selected ones of the other different cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 on the one or more public 76, private 72, community 74 or hybrid networks 78 on the cloud
communications network 18 may have stored portions 13'/82, 15'/85 of the final desired cloud electronic content 13, 15 this thereby provides a fourth layer of security and privacy (instead of just a second layer of security and privacy) for the desired
cloud electronic content on the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> Method 142 is used to reduce and/or eliminate eavesdropping and other hacking attacks on the secure cloud storage system by using information entropies (including information gain and mutual information entropies) to split portions of received
electronic content and a Galois field to create storage locations to securely store the split portions of electronic content.
<br/><br/> The information entropies used along with the Galois filed help prevent an eavesdropper from re-constructing original electronic content (i.e., plaintext) by re-constructing the plural pieces stored at plural locations on the cloud
communications network back into the whole original electronic document.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 is a flow diagram illustrating a Method 156 for storing electronic content with cloud computing using Galois fields and information entropy.  At Step 158, with the first cloud application creates the first plural portions by determines
an average message size (m) in the received electronic content in terms of probabilities of various patterns of symbols in a pre-determined alphabet occurring in a selected portion (m) of the received electronic content comprising a total message space
(M).  At Step 160, the first cloud application determines the plural information entropy probabilities as I(m)=-log.sub.p(m), where p(m)=P.sub.r(M=m) is a probability that message (m) is chosen from all possible choices in the total message space (M).
<br/><br/> Method 156 is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In such an exemplary embodiment at Step 158, with the first cloud application 30 creates the first plural portions by determines an average message size (m) in the received electronic content 13, 15 in terms of probabilities of various patterns
of symbols in the pre-determined alphabet occurring in a selected portion (m) of the received electronic content comprising a total message space (M).
<br/><br/> At Step 160, the first cloud application determines the plural information entropy probabilities as I(m)=-log.sub.p(m), where p(m)=P.sub.r(M=m) is a probability that message (m) is chosen from all possible choices in the total message space (M)
from Equation (3).
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 is a flow diagram illustrating a Method 164 for storing electronic content with cloud computing using Galois fields and information entropy.  At Step 166, with the first cloud application creates the first plural portions by determines
an average message size (m) in the received electronic content in terms of probabilities of various patterns of symbols in a pre-determined alphabet occurring in a selected portion (m) of the received electronic content comprising a total message space
(M).  At Step 168, the first cloud application determines the plural information entropy probabilities as a set mutual information I(X; Y) values of two discrete random variables X and Y obtained from selected portions m.sub.X and m.sub.Y of the received
of the received electronic content (M) using Equation (6).
<br/><br/> Method 164 is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In such an exemplary embodiment at Step 166, with the first cloud application 30 creates the first plural portions by determines an average message size (m) in the received electronic content 13, 15 in terms of probabilities of various patterns
of symbols in the pre-determined alphabet occurring in a selected portion (m) of the received electronic content comprising a total message space (M).
<br/><br/> At Step 168, the first cloud application determines the plural information entropy probabilities as a set mutual information I(X;Y) values of two discrete random variables X and Y obtained from selected portions m.sub.X and m.sub.Y of the
received of the received electronic content (M) using as Equation (6) as:
<br/><br/> .function..di-elect cons..times..di-elect cons..times..function..times..function..function..function..times..functi- on.  ##EQU00002## where p(x,y) is a joint probability distribution function of X and Y, and p(x) and p(y) are marginal
probability distribution functions of X and Y respectively.
<br/><br/> The methods and systems described herein provide electronic content storage and retrieval using Galois Fields and information entropy on cloud computing networks.  The electronic content is divided into plural portions and stored in plural cloud
storage objects based on determined information entropy probabilities of the electronic content thereby reducing location guessing of the electronic content with information gain and mutual information.  Storage locations for the plural cloud storage
objects are selected using a Galois field and the plural cloud storage objects are distributed across the cloud network.  When the electronic content is requested, the plural portions are retrieved and transparently combined back into the original
electronic content.  No server network devices storing the plural cloud storage objects or target network devices requesting the stored electronic can individually determine locations of all portions of the stored electronic content on the cloud
communications network thereby providing various levels of security and privacy for the electronic content.
<br/><br/> Storing Electronic Content with Geometric Shapes
<br/><br/> A "geometric shape" is geometric information which remains when location, scale, orientation and reflection are removed from the description of a geometric object.  With a geometric shape, a result of moving a shape around, enlarging it,
rotating it, or reflecting it in a mirror is the same shape as the original, and not a distinct shape.  Objects that have the same shape as each other are said to be "similar." If they also have the same scale as each other, they are said to be
"congruent."
<br/><br/> Many two-dimensional (2D) geornetric shapes are defined by a set of points and/or vertices and/or lines connecting the set points in a closed chain, as well as the resulting interior points.  Such shapes are called "polygons and" include
triangles, squares, and pentagons.  Other 2D shapes may be bounded by curves such as the circle or the ellipse.
<br/><br/> Many three-dimensional (3D) geometric shapes are defined by a set of vertices, lines connecting the vertices, and two-dimensional faces enclosed by those lines, as well as the resulting interior points.  Such shapes are called "polyhedrons" and
include cubes as well as pyramids such as tetrahedrons.  Other 3D shapes may be bounded by curved surfaces, such as the ellipsoid and the sphere.
<br/><br/> Geometric 4D shapes are generated by applying the rules of vectors and coordinate geometry to a space with four dimensions.  In particular a vector with four elements (i.e., a 4-tuple, etc.) can be used to represent a position in
four-dimensional space.  The space is a Euclidean space, so has a metric and norm, and so all directions are treated as the same: the additional 4th dimension is indistinguishable from the other three.
<br/><br/> Four-dimensional (4D) geometric shapes are typically defined by Euclidean space, generalizing the rules of 3D space.  In geometry.  Euclidean space encompasses a 2D Euclidean plane, a 3D space of Euclidean geometry, and certain other spaces.
<br/><br/> There is essentially only one Euclidean space of each dimension.  With Cartesian coordinates it is modelled by a real coordinate space (R.sup.X) of the same dlmension X. In one dimension, this is a line; in two dimensions, it is a Cartesian
plane; and in higher dimensions it is a coordinate space with three or more real number coordinates.  The X-dimensional Euclidean space is denoted by E.sup.X if it is necessary to emphasize its Euclidean nature, but R.sup.X is used as well since the
latter is assumed to have the standard Euclidean structure, and these two structures are not always distinguished.
<br/><br/> One way to define a Euclidean plane is as a set of points satisfying certain relationshlps, expressible in terms of distances and angles.  For example, there are two fundamental operations (referred to as "motions") on a plane.  One is
"translation," which means a shifting of the plane so that every point is shifted hi the same direction and by the same distance.  The other is "rotation" about a fixed point in the plane, in which every point ln the plane turns about that fixed point
through the same angle.
<br/><br/> One of the basic tenets of Euclidean geometry is that two figures (i.e., usually considered as subsets) of the plane should be considered equivalent (i.e., congruent) if one can be transformed into the other by some sequence of translations,
rotations and reflections.  In order to define a plane precisely, the Euclidean plane must clearly define the notions of distance, angle, translation, and rotation for a mathematically described space.  Once a Euclidean plane has been precisely
described, it is actually a simple matter to extend the plane to arbitrary dimensions (e.g., X.sup.th dimension, etc.).
<br/><br/> Geometric shapes and a path through components of the geometric shape are created to add one or more additional layer of privacy and security for storing origlnal electronic content 13/15 as original plaintext on the cloud communications network
18 as a hacker and/or observer and/or eavesdropper would have to guess the geometric shape, components (e.g., vertices, lines, faces, etc.) selected for the geometric shape and a selected path through the selected components.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 is a block diagram 168 illustrating exemplary 2D, 3D and 4D geometric shapes.  FIG. 13 illustrates a 2D triangle 170, square 172, circle 174, a 3D pyramid 176, cube 178, sphere 180 and a one type of 4D tesseract 182.  These shapes are
exemplary only and the present invention is not limited to the geometric shapes shown or limited to geometric shapes of 2D, 3D, and/or 4D and other higher dimensional shapes can also be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> The illustrated tesseract 182 is a 3D cube 178 expanded to one type 4D shape.  The tesseract 182 is to the 3D cube 178 as the 3D cube 178 is to the square 172.  Just as the surface of the cube 178 includes of six square faces, the hypersurface
of the tesseract 182 includes eight cubical cells.  There are other types of tesseracts 182 that can be created from a 3D cube 178 and the present invention is not limited to the exemplary tesseract 182 illustrated in FIG. 13.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 is a block diagram 184 illustrating an exemplary path 186 through a 3D cube 178.  The cube has its eight vertices labeled one through eight.  However, the present invention is not limited to this exemplary ordering and other ordering can
be used to order the vertices of the cube 178.  The exemplary path 186 includes the eight vertices of the cube 178 and the exemplary path 186 includes seven segments comprising vertex 1 to 3, 3 to 7, 7 to 2, 2 to 5, 5 to 8, 8 to 6 and 6 to 4.  However,
the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other paths and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.  For example, lines connecting the vertices, and two-dimensional faces enclosed by those lines.  as well as the
resulting interior points could have been selected and used instead of the set of vertices to determine the path 186 through the 3D cube 178, etc.
<br/><br/> Returning to FIG. 14, the exemplary path 186 includes the seven exemplary path segments illustrated in Table 8.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00008 TABLE 8 Cloud Storage Object Path 186 82 for received through electronic content Segment Vertices of 13'/15' assigned Cloud Network Server 22, 24, 26 Address Number 3D Cube 178 to path component Location 1 1-3 82-6

example the received electronic content 13/15 is split 13'/15' into seven pieces and stored in seven different cloud storage objects 82 (e.g., numbered 82-1, 82-2, .  . . , 82-7, etc.).  However, the present invention is not limited to such an exemplary
embodiment and other embodiments can also be used to be practice the invention.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 15A-15C are a flow diagram illustrating a Method 188 for storing electronic content with cloud computing using Galois fields and geometric shapes.  In FIG. 15A at Step 190, electronic content is received on a cloud application and stored
in a non-transitory computer readable medium on a cloud server network device with the one or more processors via a cloud communications network comprising: one or more public communication networks, one or more private networks, one or more community
networks and/or one or more hybrid networks.  At Step 192, the cloud application creates a geometric shape defined by a set of X.sup.th dimensional shape components.  At Step 194, the cloud application securely stores the created geometric shape on the
cloud server network device.  At Step 196, the cloud application securely splits the received electronic content into plural portions of electronic content based on the created geometric shape.  At Step 198, the cloud application determines a path with
p.sup.n elements through a selected set of components comprising the created geometric shape.  In FIG. 15B at Step 200, cloud application assigns one or more selected portions of the path through the geometric shape to one or more cloud storage objects. 
At Step 202, the cloud application saves the plural potions of electronic content in the plural cloud storage objects.  This thereby provides a first level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content based on the created geometric
shape and the path through the geometric shape.  At Step 204, the cloud application creates a modified Galois field GF(p.sup.n) comprising: (a) populating a first portion of a Galois field lookup table in the modified Galois field GF(p.sup.n) with
p.sup.n unique field elements comprising the p.sup.n path elements through the created geometric shape; (b) populating a second portion of the Galois field lookup table with plural virtual network address locations, actual network address locations,
virtual protocol port address designations and actual protocol port address designations, for locating plural other cloud server network devices each with one or more processors on the cloud communications network, and (c) securely storing the modified
Galois field GF(p.sup.n) on the cloud server network device.  At Step 206, the cloud application inputs one or more pre-determined inputs into the modified Galois field GF(p.sup.n) securely stored on the cloud server network device.  In FIG. 15C at Step
208, the cloud application outputs from the modified Galois field GF(p.sup.n) plural different types of address locations including: virtual network address locations, actual network address locations, virtual protocol port address designations and/or
actual protocol port address designations, and/or combinations thereof, stored in the Galois Field lookup table in the modified Galois Field GF(p.sup.n).  This thereby provides a second level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic
content based on the modified Galois field GF(p.sup.n).  At Step 210, the cloud application securely stores the determined plural address locations in a cloud content location map in the non-transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network
device.  At Step 212, the cloud application securely sends the plural cloud storage objects to the determined selected ones of the plural other cloud servers on the cloud communications network with the determined plural address locations.  The plural
cloud storage objects are assigned to different portions of the geometric and distributed and located in plural different locations on the cloud communications network.  None of the selected ones of plural other cloud server network devices can
individually determine locations of all portions of the received electronic content on the cloud communications network.  This thereby provides a third level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content on the cloud communications
network.
<br/><br/> Method 188 is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment.  However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In such an exemplary embodiment at in FIG. 15A at Step 190, electronic content 13, 15 is received on a cloud application 30' and stored in a non-transitory computer readable medium on a cloud server network device (e.g., 20, etc.) with the one
or more processors via a cloud communications network 18 comprising: one or more public communication networks 76, one or more private networks 72, one or more community networks 74 and/or one or more hybrid networks 78.
<br/><br/> At Step 192, the cloud application 30' creates a geometric shape 170-182 defined by a set of X.sup.th dimensional shape components.  The set of X.sup.th dimensional shape components includes, but is not limited to, a set of points, set of
vertices (e.g., 3D cube 178, FIG. 14), a set lines connecting the set of points in a dosed chain, a set of resulting interior points, a set of faces, a set of vectors and/or a set of coordinates for the created geometric shape 170-182.  The exact set of
shape components depends on a number of dimensions selected to create an X.sup.th dimensional shape.
<br/><br/> For example, if a 2D shape (triangle 170, square 172, circle 174, etc.) is selected, a set of points and/or vertices and/or lines connecting the set points in a closed chain, a set of faces and/or a set resulting interior points are selected.
<br/><br/> If a 3D shape (e.g., pyramid 176, cube 176, sphere 178, etc.) is selected a set of vertices, a set of lines connecting the set of vertices, a set of 2D faces enclosed by the set of lines, as well as a resulting, and/or a set of interior points
are selected.
<br/><br/> If a 4D shape (e.g., tesseract 182, etc.) is selected geometric 4D shapes are generated by applying the rules of vectors and coordinate geometry to a 3D space into four dimensions.  In particular a vector with four elements (i.e., a 4-tuple,
etc.) are used to represent positions in four-dimensional space in the 4D geometric shape.
<br/><br/> However, the present invention is not limited to such embodiments and other geometric shape components of other X.sup.th dimensions can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment at Step 192, one or more different geometric shapes 170-182 defined by a set of X.sup.th dimensional shape components are created.  In such an embodiment, the one or more different geometric shapes (e.g., cube, pyramid,
etc.) include one or more different types of shapes and/or with different of X.sup.th dimensional shape components.
<br/><br/> At Step 194, the cloud application 30' securely stores the created geometric shape 170-182 on the cloud server network device 20.
<br/><br/> At Step 196, the cloud application 30' securely spits the received electronic content 13/15 into plural portions of electronic content 13'/15' based on the created geometric shape 170-182 (e.g., with information theory methods 142 or the other
methods 104, etc., described above, etc.)
<br/><br/> At Step 198, the cloud application 30 determines a path 186 with p.sup.n elements (e.g., 2.sup.3) through a selected set of components (e.g., vertices 1-8 of 3D cube 180) comprising the created geometric shape 170-182.
<br/><br/> For example, if a 2D shape (triangle 170, square 172, circle 174, etc,) is selected, a path p.sup.n 186 through a set of points and/or vertices and/or lines connecting the set points in a closed chain, a set of faces and/or a set resulting
interior points can be selected.
<br/><br/> If a 3D shape (e.g., pyramid 176, cube 176, sphere 178, etc.) a path p.sup.n 186 is selected through a set of vertices, a set of lines connecting the set of vertices, a set of 2D faces enclosed by the set of lines and/or a resulting set of
interior points is selected.
<br/><br/> If a 4D shape (e.g., tesseract 182, etc.) a patch p.sup.n 186 is selected for 4D shapes by applying the rules of vectors and coordinate geometry to a 3D shape space 176 with four dimensions.  In particular a vector with four elements (i.e., a
4-tuple, etc.) is used to represent a position in four-dimensional space.
<br/><br/> In addition, the path 186 can include combinations of these geometric shape components can be selected through the same (e.g., vertices, etc.) or plural different types of shape components (e.g., a vertex-A (cube 178), a line-A (pyramid 176), a
face-A (tesseract 182), a vertex-B (pyramid 176) a line-B (tesseract 182), a face-B (cube 178), through plural shapes with the same or different X-dimensions and/or through a single shape with X-dimensions.
<br/><br/> However, the present invention is not limited to such embodiments and other geometric shape components of other X.sup.th dimensions can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 15B at Step 200, the cloud application 30' saves the plural potions of electronic content 13/15 in the plural cloud storage objects 13'/82-1, 15'/82-2.  This thereby provides a first level of security and privacy for storing the received
electronic content 13/15 based on the created geometric shape 170-182 and the path 186 through the geometric shape 170-182.
<br/><br/> As an example, a hacker and/or observer and/or eavesdropper would have to guess or determine the type of geometric shape 170-182 selected, the number of dimensions used for the shape, the shape components selected and the path 186 through the
geometric shape as a first step to determine where on the cloud network 18 the received electronic content 13/15 might be stored.  This thereby provides a first level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content 13/15.
<br/><br/> At Step 202, the cloud application 30' creates a modified Galois field GF(p.sup.n) (e.g., Tables 6, 7, 8 etc.) comprising: (a) populating a first portion of a Galois field lookup table in the modified Galois field GF(p.sup.n) with p.sup.n unique
field elements comprising the p.sup.n path 186 elements through the created geometric shape 170-182; (b) populating a second portion of the Galois field lookup table with a plural virtual network address locations, actual network address locations,
virtual protocol port address designations and actual protocol port address designations (e.g., Tables 7, 8, etc.), for locating a plural other cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 each with one or more processors on the cloud communications network
72, and (c) securely storing the modified Galois field GF(p.sup.n) on the cloud server network device 20.
<br/><br/> At Step 204, the cloud application 30' inputs one or more pre-determined inputs into the modified Galois field GF(p.sup.n) (Tables 6-8) securely stored on the cloud server network device 20.
<br/><br/> At Step 206, the cloud application 30' outputs from the modified Galois field GF(p.sup.n) plural different types of address locations including: virtual network address locations, actual network address locations, virtual protocol port address
designations and/or actual protocol port address designations, and/or combinations thereof, stored in the Galois Field lookup table in the modified Galois Field GF(p.sup.n) (Tables 6-8).
<br/><br/> As an example, a hacker and/or observer and/or eavesdropper would have to guess or determine what one or more inputs are used for the modified Galois field GF(p.sup.n), which one or one more polynomials are used for the modified Galois field
GF(p.sup.n) and what p.sup.n field values are associated with what virtual network address locations, actual network address locations, virtual protocol port address designations and/or actual protocol port address designations, stored in the Galois
Field lookup table are output from the modified Galois Field GF(p.sup.n).  This thereby provides a second level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content 13/15 based on the modified Galois field GF(p.sup.n).
<br/><br/> In FIG. 15C at Step 208, the cloud application 30' securely stores the determined plural address locations in a cloud content location map 17 in the non-transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device 20.
<br/><br/> At Step 210, the cloud application 20 securely sends the plural cloud storage objects 13'/82-1, 15'/82-2, etc. to the determined selected ones of the plural other cloud servers 22, 24, 26 on the cloud communications network 18 with the
determined plural address locations.  The plural cloud storage objects 13'/82-1, 15'/82-2, etc. are assigned to different portions (e.g., path 186 segments 1-7) of the geometric shape 170-182 and distributed and located in plural different locations on
the cloud communications network 18.  None of the selected ones of plural other cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 can individually determine the locations of all portions of the received electronic content on the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> As an example, a hacker and/or observer and/or eavesdropper would have to guess or determine which portions of the received electronic content 13/15 was put in which cloud storage objects 13'/82-1, 15'/82-2, etc. and stored on which other cloud
servers 22, 24, 26 to access all the original received electronic content 13/15.  This thereby provides a third level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content 13/15 on the cloud communications network 18.
<br/><br/> The first through third layers of security and privacy are achieved for storing electronic content on the cloud communications network 18 without encrypting the received electronic content which comprises plaintext.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the received electronic content is translated into ciphertext using any of the encryption or security methods described herein.  The ciphertext is then used with Method 188.  However, the present invention is not limited
to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.
<br/><br/> The stored electronic content 13'/82-1, 15'/82-2 stored with Method 188 of FIG. 15 is retrieved using Method 118 from FIG. 8.  However, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments and other embodiments can be used to practice the
invention.
<br/><br/> After executing Method 188, the original electronic content 13, 15 is requested and returned to a target network device 12, 14, 16 and/or wearable device 216-224 from the first cloud application 30' on the cloud server network device 20 on the
cloud communications network 18 using Method 118 (FIG. 8) described above.  However, at Step 130 of Method 118, since the second cloud application 30 on the target network device 12, 14, 16 and/or wearable device 216-224 cannot determine the desired
original cloud electronic content 13, 15 was stored as plural portions 13'/15' in plural cloud storage objects 82' and cannot determine which of plural selected ones of the other different cloud server network devices 22, 24, 26 on the one or more public
76, private 72, community 74 or hybrid networks 78 on the cloud communications network 18 may have stored portions 13'/82, 15'/85 of the final desired cloud electronic content 13, 15, this thereby provides a fourth layer of security and privacy (instead
of just a second layer of security and privacy) for the desired cloud electronic content on the cloud communications network 18 when used with Method 188.
<br/><br/> Wearable Devices
<br/><br/> Wearable mobile technology" and/or "wearable devices" are clothing and accessories incorporating computer and advanced electronic technologies.  Wearable mobile network devices provide several advantages including, but not limited to: (1)
Quicker access to notifications, important and/or summary notifications are sent to alert a user to view a whole new message.  (2) Heads-up information.  Digital eye wear allows users to display relevant information like directions without having to
constantly glance down; (3) Always-on Searches.  Wearable devices provide always-on, hands-free searches; and (4) Recorded data and feedback.  Wearable devices also take telemetric data recordings and providing useful feedback for users for exercise,

<br/><br/> Digital eyewear, such as GOOGLE Glass, Smart watches by SONY, NIKE, GARMIN, SAMSUNG, wrist bands and/or fitness bands by LG, NIKE, FITBIT, etc. and others are examples of wearable mobile devices.  Just like mobile and non-mobiles phones, a
current physical location of such wearable mobile devices must be determine in an emergency situation.
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 is a block diagram 214 illustrating exemplary wearable devices 216-224.  In one embodiment, the target network devices 12, 14, 16 include wearable network devices 216-224.  The wearable devices include one or more processors and include,
