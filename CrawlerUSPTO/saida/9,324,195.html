       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> An interactive system for use in connection with recreational vehicle
     usage includes a server system, including an off-road trail database
     containing trail data, trail condition information, and
     points-of-interest information, as well as a trip mapping system
     accessible by any of a plurality of riders, allowing a rider to create a
     route based on the data in the off-road trip database. The server system
     further includes a trail maintenance interface accessible by users
     affiliated with an authorized group to edit the trail data, trail
     condition information, and points-of-interest information associated with
     the authorized group. The server system includes a location data
     management system configured to receive location data, allowing a rider
     to publish location information to one or more other riders, and a user
     feedback interface configured to receive trip data from riders for
     publication, including information describing an actual route and user
     data associated with that route.

<hr/> <center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Recreational vehicles, such as motorcycles, or off-road vehicles such as all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and snowmobiles, are widely used for recreational purposes.  These vehicles might be used on both roads and trails, or only on trails.  The
trails often pass over a mixture of private and public properties, which can extend for hundreds of miles in many directions, and through different areas.  Such trails generally extend through rural areas, but can connect to gas stations, restaurants,
bars, maintenance locations, scenic areas, and other points of potential interest to outdoor adventurers.
<br/><br/> Currently, clubs in areas where such trails exist maintain the trails on which such off-road vehicles are used.  For example, a snowmobile club in a particular geographical area will maintain a relationship with the owners of the lands through
which the trails pass, and will monitor and maintain the trail conditions (e.g., by monitoring the snow and trail conditions, maintaining signs, clearing obstacles, etc.).  That club generally also will create a map that can be purchased by visitors to
the area.  The map will generally include points of interest in the area, and advertisements and coupons associated with the businesses on the map.  Those maps can be sold at gas stations, bars, restaurants, and online for use by riders who plan to visit
the area.  The cost of the map and the cost of the advertisements are used to fund the club's upkeep of the trail system in that area.
<br/><br/> This arrangement is convenient for upkeep of trails, but can be inconvenient to trail users.  There are a number of reasons for this.  For example, trail maps are generally organized by region, and riders may wish to travel among a number of
regions whose maps are maintained by different clubs.  Furthermore, trail riders may wish to have coordinated maps of points of interest that are not limited to the regions covered by a particular club, and not limited those businesses that choose to
advertise with that club.
<br/><br/> In connection with these difficulties, trail riders will often opt to purchase and download an electronic copy of the trail map, and plan their routes prior to starting that trip.  However, once that trip is planned, the user will typically
print out the trail map for use on the recreational vehicle for use.
<br/><br/> In addition, recreational vehicle usage, because it typically occurs in off-road, rural areas, may cause a rider to become stranded in a location remote from any other individual, and far from a maintenance facility for that vehicle.  For
example, in the case of a snowmobile, a user may have an equipment malfunction or other issue far from a repair shop, or even from a road.  In such cases, even if that rider had a cell phone with them (and even if that rider had service in the rural area
where such a maintenance issue occurs) it may be difficult to diagnose problems with the recreational vehicle.
<br/><br/> Beyond these existing issues in recreational vehicle usage and navigation, there is also no convenient way to coordinate route plans among riders, despite the fact that it is common to take such trips in groups.  Accordingly, improvements in the
rider experience, and in vehicle integration with the rider experience, are desired.
<br/><br/> In one illustrated embodiment of the present disclosure, an interactive system for use in connection with recreational vehicle usage includes a server system.  The server system includes an off-road trail database containing trail data, trail
condition information, and points-of-interest information, as well as a trip mapping system accessible by any of a plurality of riders, the trip mapping system allowing a rider to create a planned route based on the data in the off-road trip database and
navigate the planned route.  The server system further includes a trail maintenance interface accessible by users affiliated with an authorized group to edit at least a portion of the trail data, trail condition information, and points-of-interest
information associated with the authorized group.  The server system includes a location data management system configured to receive location data, the location data management system allowing a rider to publish his or her location information to one or
more other riders within the mapping system.  The server system further includes a user feedback interface configured to receive trip data from riders for publication to one or more other riders using the interactive system, the trip data including
information describing an actual route and user data associated with the actual route.
<br/><br/> In another illustrated embodiment of the present disclosure, a method of facilitating usage of a recreational vehicle includes receiving, from users affiliated with a plurality of authorized groups, trail data, trail condition information, and
points-of-interest information from areas affiliated with the authorized groups, respectively.  The method further includes receiving a request from a user device to define a planned off-road route in one or more of the areas, and generating a map
associated with the planned off-road route, the map including trail condition information and points-of-interest information received.  The method also includes receiving location information from a communications device at a location of a recreational
vehicle operated by the user during travel along the planned off-road route, and publishing the location information to one or more other users based on permissions set by the user.  The method includes receiving user feedback information associated with
the planned off-road route from the user.
<br/><br/> In yet another illustrated embodiment of the present disclosure, an application embodied on a computer-readable medium is disclosed that is executable on a computing device and includes program instructions that, when executed, are configured to
cause the computing device to receive user input requesting an off-road route, the user input including one or more ride parameters.  The computing device is also configured to define an off-road route based at least in part on the one or more ride
parameters and trail condition data received from one or more third-party sources, and present the off-road route to the user via a map display, including presenting a plurality of route variations to the user, the route variations including display of
one or more ride parameters of the route variations compared to the off-road route.  The computing device is further configured to receive user selection of a desired off-road route for traversal.
<br/><br/> In still another illustrated embodiment of the present disclosure, a computer-readable medium comprising computer-executable instructions is disclosed that, when executed, perform a method for integrating rider experience with recreational
vehicle performance.  The method includes receiving from a user a selection of a planned route for a recreational vehicle at a computing device associated with the recreational vehicle, and receiving at the computing device, via a communication interface
connected to a control unit of a recreational vehicle, data regarding operation of the recreational vehicle.  The method further includes displaying a user interface to a user, the user interface including information associated with the planned route
and at least a portion of the data regarding operation of the recreational vehicle, and communicating data to a remote system from the computing device, and at least a portion of the data regarding operation of the recreational vehicle.  The method also
includes receiving from the remote system one or more instructions for display to the user regarding maintenance or repair tasks to be performed on the recreational vehicle. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> Various embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals represent like parts and assemblies throughout the several views.  Reference to various embodiments does not
limit the scope of the invention, which is limited only by the scope of the claims attached hereto.  Additionally, any examples set forth in this specification are not intended to be limiting and merely set forth some of the many possible embodiments for
the claimed invention.
<br/><br/> The logical operations of the various embodiments of the disclosure described herein are implemented as: (1) a sequence of computer implemented steps, operations, or procedures running on a programmable circuit within a computer, and/or (2) a
sequence of computer implemented steps, operations, or procedures running on a programmable circuit within a directory system, database, or compiler.
<br/><br/> As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems and methods that provide for a guided, interactive user experience for use in off-road or recreational vehicle usage.  This can include, for example, usage
in connection with motorcycle, all-terrain vehicle, snowmobile, or other types of recreational vehicles, and involves aggregation of user feedback regarding trail information and points-of-interest data, club information regarding trail conditions, and
weather, hazard, and vehicle data to enrich the rider experience.  By providing users with shared information regarding trail condition, length, difficulty, weather, and points of interest data, while also displaying to a rider various data regarding his
her vehicle on a display alongside weather or hazard data and locations of other riders along a particular trail, that user's experience can be improved, by ensuring that the user is connected with the people, places, and vehicle experiences that will
encourage the user to continue use of recreational vehicles.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 1, an interactive system 100 is shown for use in connection with recreational vehicle usage, according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure.  The interactive system 100 includes a server system, shown as
recreational vehicle portal server 102, hosting a trail and rider database 104.  The recreational vehicle portal server 102, referred to herein as server 102, generally corresponds to one or more computing systems configured to store and process data
associated with one or more riders of recreational vehicles, as well as data associated with trails of interest to those riders.  Such data can be located in the trail and rider database 104, or can be received from any of a plurality of data providers,
such as data providers 106a-e, discussed below.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment shown, the server 102 is accessible by any of a plurality of users of recreational vehicles 108, which can include off-road vehicles, such as all-terrain vehicles or snowmobiles, and can also include other types of recreational
vehicles such as motorcycles.  It is noted that, although in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1 only snowmobiles are shown, it is understood that other types of recreational vehicles could be used as well, according to the various aspects of the
present disclosure.
<br/><br/> The server 102 is also accessible via a plurality of other computing devices, such as a mobile device 110 (e.g., a mobile phone or tablet device) and/or a computing device 112 having a web browser installed thereon.  However, for some uses of
the server 102, a computing device 112 and associated web browser may be required to enable some functionality, while in other example embodiments, an application installed on a mobile device 110 may be required.  For example, as discussed in connection
with some embodiments of user interfaces discussed below, location-based services in which a user's location is published, and where loyalty-based social networking and location services are provided may require use of a mobile device 110, while some
features, such as entry of trail maintenance and/or condition data may require entry through a specific web interface by particular individuals (e.g., authorized members of a club responsible for maintaining the trail).  In the example shown, first and
second computing devices 112a-b are shown, representing a user acting as a rider (computing device 112a) and a second computing device associated with a member of a trail-managing club (computing device 112b), respectively.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment shown, a plurality of third-party data services is integrated with the information delivered to the users of devices 110, 112a-b. The data services, provided by data providers 106a-e, allow for integration of a variety of types
of data in a user interface coordinated by server 102.  In the embodiment shown, the data providers 106a-e include a map data provider 106a, a weather data provider 106b, a GIS data provider 106c, an advertising data provider 106d, and a trail condition
data provider 106e.
<br/><br/> The map data provider 106a delivers map services to the server 102, with which various data overlay services can be provided including trail or route data, trail or route plans, GIS data, or other types of information as discussed herein.  In
some cases, the weather data provider 106b can provide weather data such as forecast data, or could alternatively (or in addition) provide current weather or radar data for overlay on the map data received from the map data provider 106a, for delivery to
a user who is a rider of a recreational vehicle 108, for example to allow that rider to view forecast or current inclement weather conditions.  The GIS data provider 106c similarly provides overlay information allowing for definition of topography,
locations of properties, locations of cities/towns, trails, roads, and other information.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the advertising data provider 106d delivers advertisements to users who are riders.  The advertising systems of the present disclosure can take many forms.  For example, in some cases, when a particular route is being
displayed, advertising corresponding to businesses located along that route can be displayed to the user.  In such cases, the advertising is managed by the server 102, or specific advertising businesses are selected by one or more trail clubs that manage
a particular area of a trail system.  Correspondingly, and as discussed in further detail below, proceeds from advertising may be apportioned to the trail club in the area based on the frequency of display of advertising, or other metrics.  As such,
trail clubs can continue to receive revenue from advertising that currently is received based on placement of advertisements on printed trail maps associated with the area the trail club maintains.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment shown, the trail condition data provider 106e provides to the server 102 trail condition data.  This trail condition data illustratively includes reported data from trail clubs or users, but typically corresponds to third party
trail condition data, such as may be monitored by a governmental organization (e.g., the department of natural resources for the state in which the trail is located), or other regional groups.
<br/><br/> In an illustrated embodiment, other data providers are integrated with such a system as well.  For example, in the case where social networking services are provided for riders using the services provided by system 100, such services are either
integrated into the server 102 or provided by a further data provider 106.
<br/><br/> In addition to the data providers and third party contributors, a dealer 114 is illustratively provided access to the server 102, for example to manage, store, and access vehicle maintenance records associated with particular vehicles.  In such
embodiments, the dealer 114 stores such records locally, and receives maintenance and/or repair information from a vehicle 108 from the server 102, or alternatively stores all such maintenance and repair information in the database 104, associated with
the server 102.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 1, the various data providers 106e are communicatively interconnected with the server 102 via a network 116, such as the Internet.  Additionally, such a network is used by users of mobile device 110 or computing devices
112a-b, as well as dealers 114 for communicative interconnection to the server 102.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 2, additional details regarding the server 102 and the trail and rider database 104 of FIG. 1 are shown.  The server 102 generally provides a plurality of interfaces and services by which data are aggregated and delivered
to users who are riders of recreational vehicles.  As further discussed herein, the interfaces and services delivered to those users include trip planning, navigation, social networking and trail feedback, and vehicle maintenance and repair services,
among others.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment shown, the server 102 includes a mobile application interface 202 and a web interface 204 that provide user access to various mapping, planning, and on-trail data services.  The web interface 202 allows a user to connect to the
server 102 via a computing device 112, and register his or her recreational vehicle with the server 102.  The mobile application interface 202 provides analogous functionality via a downloadable application stored on a smartphone or tablet device, such
as mobile device 110.  Furthermore, through the web interface 204 or mobile application interface 202, the user plans a route that the user intends to take on his/her recreational vehicle, and the server 102, based on the trail condition data, confirms
that the selected route is passable.  The web interface also allows users to select their skill level, and presents various possible available routes based on the vehicle type defined by the user (snowmobile, all-terrain vehicle, motorcycle, etc.) and
associated skill levels for those routes.  For example, a beginner motorcycle rider has routes presented to him or her that are limited to non-technical street routes, while a snowmobile rider is routed solely on trails, since snowmobiles are not
typically ridden on roads.  The route displayed includes, for example, a distance and expected time for traveling the route based on the user's skill level.  Other data, such as fuel needed along the route, or display of alternative routes nearby, is
delivered as well.  Various other possible route selection features are possible as well, as further discussed below.
<br/><br/> In addition to the route selection features, the mobile application interface 202 and web interface 204 each allow the user to "preview" the trip that is selected, for example by providing a user-perspective "fly-through" view or simulation of a
selected route, based on trail photos or videos collected in the database 104.  Additionally, a user feedback interface available in the mobile application interface 202 and web interface allows a user to indicate that he or she has taken a particular
route, and allows that user to enter a review of their experience when taking that route.  This information is used by subsequent riders, during trip planning, since it can be made visible in association with the route planning features discussed above.
<br/><br/> The mobile application interface 202 and web interface 204 also allow for tracking one or more other individuals' locations along a trail, for example to trace where fellow riders are along a trail, or to monitor progress of friends or relatives
who are on a trail ride.  Additional details regarding the features presented by the mobile application interface 202 are discussed below in connection with FIG. 3, and examples of user displays generated by such interfaces are discussed in further
detail below in connection with FIGS. 7-22.
<br/><br/> In addition to the mobile application and web interfaces 202-204, in the embodiment shown the server 102 includes a plurality of data interfaces.  These data interfaces can include, for example, a third party data provider interface 206, which
receives and manages data associated with data providers 106a-e, as well as a club portal interface 208.  The club portal interface 208 is configured to manage communication with members of regional trail clubs.  These trail clubs generally maintain and
monitor the status of trails in a particular geographical area.  Members of the trail club can therefore use the portal interface 208 to update trail routes, trail conditions, provide advisories to trail riders (e.g., instructions to avoid departing
trails that pass through private land, tips regarding scenic locations or routes, etc.), and notes regarding local regulations.  An advertising manager component 210 coordinates with the club portal to communicate with an advertising provider 106e, to
control the types of advertisements provided to users of the mobile or web interfaces 202, 204, thereby limiting the advertisements displayed to a user to those approved by the club, or those in the same geographical area as the club.  As further
discussed below in connection with FIG. 6, the advertising manager also manages revenue apportionment across trail clubs and other entities, to provide incentives to contribute to the overall system 100.
<br/><br/> In addition, a dealer interface 212 can be included, which associates one or more of the riders using the services of the server 102 with a particular dealer.  The dealer interface 212 is used in a number of ways.  In some cases, the dealer
interface is used to communicate error codes or diagnostic data received from one or more recreational vehicles 108, for example to receive in response repair instructions or maintenance tips from the dealer(s) associated with those vehicles. 
Accordingly, riders of recreational vehicles are ensured of vehicle repair support during trail rides, while dealers receive notifications of possible repairs, allowing the dealer to provide additional value to customers who use such vehicles that
support diagnostic data communication via the server 102.
<br/><br/> The database 104 stores various types of data used by the server 102, including the various interfaces 202-210, to generate, along with data providers 106a-e, services to be presented to users who are riders of recreational vehicles.  In the
embodiment shown, the database 104 includes trail data 220 used for route planning purposes, which can include routes, property details, and trail condition data as may be received from a club member or third party data provider.  The database 104 can
also include trail photos 222, either submitted by riders who have previously traveled along the trails, or from a trail photo capture system useable to generate a "fly-through" sequential photo playback that simulates traveling along the trail.  The
database 104 further includes user feedback 224, which can include reviews of a trail, as well as ratings of the trail (e.g., difficulty, time required to traverse, etc.) as well as notes regarding points of interest, or other features.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment shown, the database 104 includes rider location data 226, which can be received from a mobile device hosting a complementary application via mobile interface 202, or directly from a GPS-equipped recreational vehicle.  The rider
location data 226 is used to provide turn-by-turn navigation along on- and off-road routes, and is also selectively published to other riders, for example other riders in a group of riders who wish to track each other's progress along a trail. 
Additionally, points-of-interest data 228 is received from users or club members, and includes specific scenic locations or businesses alongside trails.  The points-of-interest data is displayed to the users.  For example, the data is overlaid on a
mapping display as illustrated below.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the database 104 includes vehicle maintenance data 230 and vehicle repair data 232.  The vehicle maintenance data 230 includes information associated with general vehicle maintenance tips that are provided to the user, as
well as specific maintenance records associated with the user's recreational vehicle.  The vehicle repair data 232 includes instructions for responding to various malfunctions that may occur on such vehicles, for example including instructions for
physically repairing the vehicles, or for responding to error codes received at the server 102 that are generated by an electronic control unit of a recreational vehicle, as discussed further below in connection with FIGS. 4-5.  This maintenance and
repair data is, for example, provided by the user via the mobile application or web interfaces 202, 204, or from a dealer 114 as illustrated in FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> In operation, the server 102 uses the data stored in database 104 for a variety of applications that are provided to a user via the web or mobile application interfaces 204, 202, respectively.  Accordingly, in FIG. 3, an example embodiment of a
mobile application 300 is illustrated, which represents functionality that is made available to a user of a mobile device (e.g., device 110) that is communicatively connected to the server 102.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment shown, the mobile application 300 resides in a memory 302 of a mobile device 110, which typically includes a programmable circuit, display, camera, and global positioning system (GPS) antenna.  Generally, the mobile application
300 is configured to interface to the mobile application interface 202 of FIG. 2, on the server 102.  By way of this communicative connection, the mobile application 300 delivers a number of services to a user who is a rider of a recreational vehicle. 
In particular, the mobile application includes, in the embodiment shown, a route planner component 304, a buddy tracker component 306, a route flythrough component 308, and a points-of-interest component 310.  The mobile application 300 also includes,
for use during the trip, turn-by-turn navigation component 312 and a vehicle interface 314.
<br/><br/> The route planner component 304 provides a mechanism by which a user selects and plans one or more routes on which to take a ride with his/her recreational vehicle.  The route planner component 304 includes a rules engine that operates to
automatically plan a "best" route for a user given a set of parameters.  For example, the route planner component 304 determines a distance, duration, difficulty level, and expected fuel consumption of a particular ride, based for example on map and GIS
data received by data providers.  The route planner 304 includes selectable options that allow a user to either select a particular destination (in which case the best route between a start point and that destination is supplied) or to route a user on a
loop of a predetermined duration, based on skill of the user and starting location.  In some embodiments, the route planner component 304 is configured to search for and/or present to a user a set of routes from which that user can select a desired
route, with the routes varying in duration and/or difficulty.  The route planner component 304, in such embodiments, is directed by a user to select only "safe" or "challenging" rides for display to the user, and is configured according to rider skill
level.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the route planner component 304 further includes a ride finder, which locates previously-taken routes of that user/rider or other riders.  In such embodiments, the route planner component 304 causes display of trails and/or
destinations that are recommended by other riders, and includes, for example, text describing the ride or trail, pictures, and video highlights provided by other riders for viewing by the user of the application 300, to allow that user to select a ride
or trail recommended by others.  In addition, the route planner component 304 allows users to save and share their own historical routes, as well as upload to the server pictures, videos, and descriptions of those routes.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the route planner component 304 also accounts for, when assisting in planning a route, whether that route will cross any private land.  In some embodiments, the route planner component 304, when determining a route to be
displayed to a user, is configured (e.g., at a user's option) to display only routes that avoid crossing private land.
<br/><br/> The buddy tracker component 306 allows a user to publish his/her location to be viewable by others during a trip, and also allows the user to view others' locations on a map interface, for example as illustrated in FIG. 16, discussed below.  In
some embodiments, the buddy tracker component 306 coordinates with the route planner to determine if the rider, during the course of a ride, is on a collision course with another rider, and can notify that rider accordingly.  For example, a second rider
may be ahead of the rider having the application running, but that second rider may have stopped, for rest or due to an equipment malfunction.  The rider, if traveling at a high rate of speed, may not have adequate time to see that second rider stopped
on a trail before he/she needs to stop.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the route flythough component 308 allows playback and pausing of a route traveled, as well as managing a virtual "fly-through" or simulation of a route.  This "fly-through" corresponds to a projected, 360-degree view of a route,
based on captured images along a route.  In some cases, the trail photos 222 stored in database 104 includes a set of photographs or videos used for such a "fly-through" feature.
<br/><br/> The points-of-interest component 310 is configured to display one or more points of interest associated with a selected route.  In some such embodiments, the points-of-interest component 310 includes a feature in which the points-of-interest
component associates specific points of interest with a particular trail club along which those points of interest are located.  In such embodiments, the point of interest information that is displayed is limited to the specific points of interest
provided by that trail club, or in the area managed by the trail club.
<br/><br/> The turn-by-turn navigation component 312 provides, once a user has selected a particular route, turn by turn directions for following that route, analogous to those turn by turn directions available via current road-based navigation systems,
but managed based on GIS and trail data received from a plurality of sources and data providers.
<br/><br/> The vehicle interface 314 also provides additional functionality during a ride, and receives data from a vehicle that indicates a current of historical operational state of the vehicle.  For example, in some embodiments, the vehicle interface
314 receives data from an electronic control unit of a vehicle, and is configured to display such information on a display of a mobile device (e.g., in the case of fuel consumption, speed, throttle position, or other similar operational parameters), or
communicates such data, such as error codes or other issues, to a server for relay to a dealer or repairperson.  In those cases, the dealer or repairperson communicates with the user of the application 300, for example to provide information regarding
how to fix issues on the recreational vehicle.
<br/><br/> Audible interface 316 can be used in a variety of contexts, and simplifies operation of the mobile application by presenting the user with audible updates as to the route, turn by turn directions, locations of buddies along the trail, or points
of interest that are being approached.  This allows the user to keep his or her eyes on the trail while traveling.
<br/><br/> In addition to the above, the mobile application also includes a user feedback component 318.  The user feedback component 318 is used during or after a ride, for example to provide that user's information regarding the perceived difficulty,
length, or feedback regarding points of interest encountered during the ride.  In some embodiments, the user feedback component 318 includes a social networking aspect in which the user "checks in" or comments regarding businesses that are located along
a trail, and provides tips to other riders regarding those points of interest.
<br/><br/> In accordance with the various components and interfaces of FIG. 3, it is noted that the mobile application is configured to generate a plurality of user interfaces, examples of which that illustrate the above-described functionality being shown
in FIGS. 7-22, described below.  Furthermore, although the functionality of the mobile application 300 is discussed in terms of a mobile device system, it is recognized that most, if not all, of the same functionality is provided via a web interface
accessible via a browser of a desktop or laptop computing system.  In some cases, where mobile device functionality such as GPS or camera features are used, corresponding features of the mobile application 300 may be unavailable via a browser-based
version of the application.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIGS. 4-5, example embodiments of systems are shown that integrate communication from a recreational vehicle to the server 102.  In general, the embodiments illustrated herein communicate with the server 102, either directly as
illustrated in FIG. 1 or are coordinated through the vehicle interface 314 of the mobile application 300, to provide to that user "on-trail" information.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, a first embodiment of integrating communication of a recreational vehicle 108 into the system 100 of FIG. 1 is shown.  In the embodiment shown, the recreational vehicle 108 has an electronic control unit (ECU)
402, which is communicatively connected, as is known, to various vehicle subsystems, such as an engine 404, user inputs 406 (e.g., throttle, braking, or other input information), as well as sensor data 408 (e.g., ambient and exhaust temperatures, fuel
levels, component sensors, etc.).  The ECU 402 is typically communicatively connected to a controller area network (CAN) interface 410, which exposes various parameters of operation of the vehicle 108.  In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, an integrated
controller 412 is communicatively connected to a gauge or display 414 and a communication interface 416, which is, for example, a cellular or satellite communication interface, communicatively connectable to server 102.  The controller 412 illustrative
includes a programmable circuit and memory, and as such cooperates with the display 414 to provide much of the functionality discussed above with respect to the mobile application 300.  In addition, various other components, such as a GPS or audible
interface, are included in the overall recreational vehicle system as well, to provide additional functionality that is desired natively within the recreational vehicle.  Additional details of this embodiment are described below with reference to FIG.
25.
<br/><br/> In contrast to FIG. 4, in FIG. 5 a mobile device 110 is used, with integration at the CAN interface 410.  This is accomplished, for example, by connecting a dongle 420 or other wired-to-wireless or direct-wired connection between the ECU 402 and
the mobile device 110.  In some embodiments, a dongle 420 implements a Bluetooth, radio frequency (RF) or some other short-range wireless standard for wireless communication between the ECU and a communication interface 450 of the mobile device 110.  In
such an arrangement, the mobile device 110 includes a controller 452 that receives data from the ECU 402, and integrates a display 454 and various peripheral devices 456 (e.g., GPS, camera, etc.), for integration of vehicle operational data with data
received at the mobile device, in accordance with the functionality discussed above in connection with FIG. 3.
<br/><br/> It is noted that, via the CAN interface 410, a variety of types of information are provided for display at the vehicle, or for communication to the server 102.  In various embodiments, vehicle data received from the ECU 402 includes, for
example: engine revolutions per minute; vehicle speed; coolant temperature; battery voltage; fuel level; throttle position; pedal position; fuel consumption rate; vehicle range; engine load; barometric pressure; air intake temperature; exhaust air
temperature; gear indication; spark timing; operational hours; drive status; and trouble codes.  Other types of information is received via the CAN interface 410, depending upon the particular type of vehicle and features included thereon.  Examples of
display information that integrates route and vehicle information are illustrated in the user interfaces of FIGS. 21-22.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 6, an example data administration arrangement 600 is shown which is useable in connection with the system 100 of FIG. 1, and which illustrates how various types of data that is received from users of various types (e.g.,
riders, trail club members, advertisers, etc.) are received and managed, and how attendant revenue is managed and distributed across those entities as well.  In the embodiment shown, clubs 602, which generally include trail maintenance organizations who
typically receive revenue from advertisements on trail maps, are validated as recognized organizations (step 604).  Validated clubs and associated members can then provide trail data, including new and/or updated trail data, to be stored in the database
102 (step 606).  That trail data is validated (step 608), and the validated trail data is then merged with trail data maintained by a larger aggregator of trail data, such as the trail maps maintained by USTRAILS.org or some other analogous organization
(step 610), prior to storage in the database 102 of trail data 220.  For example, the aggregated trail data includes trails generally entirely on public lands, whereas the club-maintained trails may include trails on private lands where a club has
negotiated some right-of-way or through-route with the landowner.
<br/><br/> In addition to receiving club and third party trail data, users provide information regarding trails (step 612), either as aggregate to the club trail data (e.g., providing reviews of the club-provided trails, or directly providing additional
comments regarding the public trails.  The information regarding the club-sponsored trails includes, for example, trail condition information, review information regarding the quality, difficulty, or other information regarding the trails (step 614).
<br/><br/> To support the aggregation of trail data, a revenue model is incorporated into the overall data administration at the server, and is included, for example as part of the advertising manager component 210 of the server 102.  In the embodiment
shown, the revenue model includes generation of revenue 620 from various sources, such as original equipment manufacturers 652 who wish to be integrated into such a system as well as revenue from downloads of a mobile application 300 (shown as
application revenue 652), and advertising revenue 654.  In the arrangement shown, trail clubs and other trail aggregators are illustratively compensated out of this revenue, either directly by advertisers or as subsidized by application downloads or OEMs
directly.
<br/><br/> In addition, it is noted that a mobile application 300 is downloadable by various individuals, such as a vehicle owner 660, a rider 662, or a third party vehicle owner 654, which represents an owner of a recreational vehicle that is not
supported by the overall system 100, for example because it is manufactured by a non-participant OEM.  It is noted that some features and functionalities discussed above, which are typically provided to users of a mobile application, may not be available
to users of a mobile application in connection with a recreational vehicle manufactured by a non-participant OEM.  For example, integration of vehicle data and application data, such as is used to display vehicle data within the application 300, or to
send error codes to server 102 to receive on-trail repair and maintenance support, is not provided in such cases.  However, in each case, the application is used by these individuals 660-664 to provide trail reviews, as well as up-to-date trail condition
information (step 666), which is integrated with the club or third party information, as discussed above in connection with steps 612-614.
<br/><br/> Now referring to FIGS. 7-22, various example user interfaces of a mobile application 300 are illustrated, which show some of the example operations that are provided for by the system 100 of FIG. 1, as reflected in a display of a mobile device
110, before, during, and after a ride via a recreational vehicle.  As discussed above, the various features and functionalities illustrated in FIGS. 7-22 may at least in part be made available via a web interface to a user of a computing device and
associated web browser, or via a display integrated into a recreational vehicle (as illustrated in FIG. 4).  In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 25, the features of FIGS. 7-22 are displayed on a display of gauge 414 located within the vehicle.
<br/><br/> Referring first to FIG. 7, an example user interface 700 used for managing trail data by a user or recreational vehicle rider is shown.  The user interface 700 represents a general menu interface that allows a user to use a route tracking
component of the web or mobile application, to view or plan various routes.  In the embodiment shown, the user interface 700 includes a route tracking option 702, a route planning option 704, and a route import option 706.
<br/><br/> The route tracking option 702 allows a user to select from among a plurality of pre-saved routes, or to create a new route using a mapping and direction creation feature.  The route planning option 704 allows that same user to view a set of
pre-defined, shared routes, and to view points of interest, difficulty levels, and other types of information associated with that route.  A route import option 706 allows the user to import data, such as may be included in a route description file
(e.g., a flat file or markup language file defining route coordinates) to be used as a route to be traveled.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment shown in FIG. 7, a number of additional mapping options are displayed on the user interface 700 as well.  A routes option 708 allows display of alternative routes between a start and end point, and a way-points option 710
allows a user to define one or more waypoints along a selected trail that are used as rest locations, or to define the desired trail to the automatic mapping features of the system.  An events option 712 allows a user to define rest times, specific
locations and times, or specific occurrences along a trail that may be of interest.  An information option 714 allows the user to provide descriptive information about the trail to be traveled, for example to provide that trail to others who will be
along on the trip.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, general options that allow user navigation within the application 300 are included on the illustrated user interface as well.  These include general pieces of information that may be of interest to the user, such as a weather option
720, a dealers option 722, a services option 724, and a routes option 726.  Additional types of options include, for example in a hidden menu that can be reached via a "more" option (shown as ellipses 728).  The weather option 720 causes a weather screen
to be displayed, for example weather in an area in proximity to a selected route, as illustrated in FIG. 18.  The dealers option 722 allows a user to view nearby dealers or that particular individual's dealer, for example to allow that individual to
contact the dealer while on the trail.  In one embodiment, a parts check option allows the user to check for the availability of a certain repair part or accessory at an identified dealer on the trail route.  The services option allows the user to view
additional services available to the user, for example regarding maintenance or repair services.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 illustrates an example user interface 800 that is used for planning a route by a user or recreational vehicle rider.  The user interface 800 includes saved routes 802 of the rider, as well as bookmarked routes 804 of other riders, and
nearby routes 806 that have been published by other riders.  A routes listing 808 displays available routes, and a new route option 810 allows the user to initiate an auto-mapping process by which the user defines a new route between points, or
point-to-point, using waypoints defined by the waypoints option discussed above in FIG. 7.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 illustrates an example user interface 900 that is used for viewing route data by a user or recreational vehicle rider, for example once a particular route has been selected.  In the embodiment shown, a route usage option 902 illustrates a
frequency of use of that route, and an edit route option allows the user to change the route based on his/her preferences.  The interface 900 also includes a route map 906 (shown schematically), and route contours 908 that illustrate elevation and
distance of a particular route.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 illustrates an example user interface 1000 that is used for viewing points of interest along a planned route by a user or recreational vehicle rider.  The interface 1000 includes a start point and endpoint 1002a-b of a route 1003, as
well as flagged points of interest 1004 along the route 1003, on a map display interface 1006.  The points of interest 1004 illustratively include scenic views, businesses, or other information.  An information panel 1008 provides information regarding
the route generally; upon selection of one or more of the points of interest, additional details regarding that point of interest, or reviews by other users, is displayed in the panel 1008.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 11-12 illustrate an example user interface 1100 used for tracking a route by a user or recreational vehicle rider.  The route tracking user interface provides a playback of a route traveled by a user, for example to allow that user to
revisit his/her route upon completion of the route.  Additional details of the route storage and playback are discussed below.  The route tracking interface 1100 displays the map display interface 1006, but includes location information, as well as a
play/pause option 1102.  The route tracking interface 1100 includes an information bar 1104 that illustrates distance traversed, time required, and optionally includes a variety of other types of information, such as fuel consumed, speed at each location
(if vehicle data is available) or other information associated with the ride.  As seen in FIG. 12, a route management option 1106 allows a user to save or delete the route that was traversed.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 illustrates an example user interface 1300 used for creating a new route by a user or recreational vehicle rider, as well as illustrating historical information regarding routes.  The user interface includes an add new trip option 1302
which instantiates the route planning features described above.  The user interface 1300 also includes a history 1304 of recorded trips, which is selected for tracking and playback as illustrated in the user interface 1100 of FIGS. 11-12.  Additionally,
accumulated statistics 1306 are displayed, showing, for example, total miles logged by the rider, as well as typical ride times, distances, and other historical information.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 14-15 illustrate a further example user interface 1400 that is used for displaying hazards along a route to a user or recreational vehicle rider.  The user interface 1400 generally illustrates a mapping area 1402, as discussed above in
connection with the route planner and points of interest data, but in this view, one or more hazards 1404 are displayed along a selected route.  Example hazards, such as reported crashes, fallen trees, closed roads, or other hazardous conditions such as
snow grooming equipment on the trail are marked.  Upon selection of the hazard 1404, additional details regarding the type and duration of the hazard are displayed, as seen in FIG. 15.  Additionally, an alternate route option 1406 allows a user to have
an alternate route generated to avoid the hazard, using the routing components discussed above.
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 illustrates an example user interface 1600 used for displaying locations of selected other individuals along a route to a user or recreational vehicle rider.  The user interface 1600 accordingly implements a "buddy tracker" component of
the system in which a user selects one or more other riders to track along a preselected route.  The buddy tracker illustrates relative positions of those riders along the trail.  As seen in FIG. 16, upon selection of one of the icons 1602 on a map
display 1604 illustrating other riders, information about that rider, such as his/her name and relative location, are displayed.  In some embodiments, the buddy tracker feature implemented using the user interface 1600 is integrated with the hazards
display, for example in the event that a user rides too close to another rider, thereby transforming the buddy tracker into a hazard display, showing a warning to those riders (and nearby riders).
<br/><br/> FIG. 17 illustrates a still further example user interface 1700 used for displaying details regarding a selected individual to a user or recreational vehicle rider.  The user interface 1700 is displayed, for example, upon selection of a buddy or
display of a user profile to show additional information about that other rider.  The illustrated user interface includes an information area 1702 including name and photograph of the rider, as well as statistics 1704 regarding that rider, such as miles
traveled, frequency or last ride times, or shared routes 1706 with that rider.  Optionally, a "follow" option 1706 is included as well, allowing the user to track that rider, for example to add that rider to his/her buddy tracker, or to view additional
details regarding that user, or to integrate various social networking features useable in connection with that user (analogous to a "friend" or follower in various social networking systems currently available).
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 illustrates an example user interface 1800 used for displaying weather data along a trail to a user or recreational vehicle rider.  The user interface 1800 includes a map display 1802 that includes a route 1804 selected by the user, and
optionally includes an icon 1806 illustrating that user's current location on the route.  The map display 1802 includes an overlay of weather information 1808, either in icon form (as shown) or as radar data, illustrating locations and details regarding
portions of the trail experiencing inclement weather.  Other information such as, for example, warnings (appear large and then shrink on display), snow depth, dealer locations, trail overlays, and approved backcountry routes may be provided on the map
display.  Additional points-of-interest displayable on the display include lodging, medical, shelter, rest areas, gas, and landmarks.
<br/><br/> FIG. 19 illustrates an example user interface 1900 used for displaying and reporting trail details to a user or recreational vehicle rider.  The user interface 1900 is therefore integrated with a route planning feature as discussed above, in
connection with display of difficulty and distance information for a particular route, and is also used to provide feedback to a trail club or other riders regarding a route, as discussed above in connection with FIG. 6.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment shown, the user interface 1900 includes a trail rating section 1902 in which the user includes trail ratings regarding the trail conditions, difficulty, and scenery of the trail, and views an aggregate rating of other riders on
that trail.  The user interface 1900 also includes a trail club region 1904 in which the name of the trail club managing the trail is shown, as well as options 1906 for the rider to donate to the trail club in varying amounts, as well as on a one-time or
repeated basis.
<br/><br/> FIG. 20 illustrates an example user interface 2000 used for integrating social media features into a trail rider system for use by a user or recreational vehicle rider.  The user interface 2000 includes a check-in option 2002, which allows the
user to "check in" to a particular trial or point of interest, analogous to many other location-based social networking systems currently available (e.g., Foursquare, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Google+, etc.).  In accordance with the present disclosure, it is understood
that various other features of such a system, such as "mayorships" or various locations, as well as including a recommendations system as part of the trail feedback, could be included as well.
<br/><br/> A community option 2004 allows the user to view a group of users in the area, or on the trail, at a particular time, as well as recent activity of the users to which that user is connected (e.g., by using the "follow" option 1708 discussed
above).  Additionally, a safety option 2006 allows for display of safety-related information regarding the ride or operation of a particular recreational vehicle, or features that may be specific to the trail that is being ridden.  Additionally, a
rewards option 2008 is included, and is used by businesses or other points of interest to reward repeated visits or "check-ins" to that business as a point of interest, or includes incentives that the business wishes to provide to recreational vehicle
riders to encourage them to visit the point of interest.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 21-22 illustrates user interfaces 2100, 2200, respectively, that display information that includes integrated vehicle information, such as some of the types of information available from a vehicle ECU, as discussed above in connection with
FIGS. 4-5.  In the embodiment shown in FIG. 21, a user interface 2100 includes a speedometer 2102, as well as gauges 2104a-c that display acceleration, power, and torque, respectively.  It is understood that other types of gauges, and other data, could
be included in the display as well.  Additional gauge data is discussed below.  In FIG. 22, a fuel user interface 2200 is displayed that includes a fuel profile 2202.  The fuel profile includes a current fuel consumption 2204, an average fuel consumption
2206, as well as a fuel level 2208 and a range 2210 based on the expected fuel consumption for the remainder of the planned route.  Additionally, a fuel flow gauge 2212, illustrating a rate of fuel flow to the engine, is provided.
<br/><br/> In both FIG. 21 and FIG. 22, options are included that allow for navigation among the available vehicle data.  For example, in the embodiments shown, user interfaces 2100, 2200 include a speed option 2120 that causes display of the user
interface 2100, as well as a fuel options 2122 that causes display of the user interface 2200.  Additional options cause display of other displays; in the example shown, a route option 2124 returns the user to the route planning and tracking user
interfaces of FIGS. 7-18, while an engine option 2126 displays additional engine parameters to the user, such as the listing of parameters discussed above as available from the ECU and vehicle 110 of FIGS. 4-5.  Additional menu options are accessible via
a "more" option 2128 (shown as ellipses).
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIGS. 23-24, methods of facilitating usage of a recreational vehicle are discussed, according to example embodiments of the present disclosure, including methods for planning and traveling various recreational vehicle routes
(including off-road routes), as well as for integrating route planning and vehicle data into a comprehensive display to improve the rider experience.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment shown in FIG. 23, a method 2300 is generally instantiated with receipt of trail data, for example from a trail data aggregator or from a plurality of trail clubs (step 2302).  Based on that trail data, one or more users of an
application or web interface then request route data, to search for or automatically generate a route that the user wishes to traverse (step 2304).  This includes, for example, parameters entered by the user, such as a trail difficulty, travel time,
specific points of interest or waypoints to be visited, or other options.  The mobile application 300 and/or server 102 generates and causes display of one or more route options based on the parameters provided by the user (step 2306).  Upon display of
the one or more routes, a user selects a route that he/she wishes to travel (step 2308).
<br/><br/> Once the user has selected a desired route, a map illustrating the route is generated, as illustrated in the user interfaces of FIGS. 7-18, generally (step 2310).  The map is selected to display additional options relating to that route, such as
points of interest (as in FIG. 10), hazards (as in FIGS. 14-15), buddies located along the route (as in FIG. 16), weather information (as in FIG. 18), or other types of information (step 2312).  In the embodiment shown, the map displays a current
location of the user on that user's display (step 2314), and optionally publishes that information to other users for tracking in their applications, for example in buddy tracker features of corresponding applications associated with other riders (step
2316).  Once the user has completed his/her ride, that user then provides feedback regarding the ride, such as by providing commentary regarding the route, including text or ratings regarding difficulty or scenery of the trail taken (step 2318).
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 24, a method 2400 for integrating such user-based information as discussed above with vehicle information is provided.  In the method 2400, a route selection of a user is received (step 2402), and data from a recreational
vehicle is also received, for example from the vehicle 108 at a server 102 as seen in FIG. 4, or at a mobile device 110, as seen in FIG. 5 (step 2404).  A display is provided to the user, such as is seen in FIGS. 21-22, that displays vehicle information
to a user in an application that combines vehicle and user information (step 2406).  Optionally, vehicle information and operational parameters can also be delivered to the server 102 for other purposes as well, such as transmitting error code or
maintenance information (steps 2408 and 2410).  In response, maintenance or repair information is received either at the vehicle 108 or mobile device 110, for presentation to a user (e.g., a person needing to repair his/her vehicle while on the trail)
(step 2412).
<br/><br/> Another embodiment of the present disclosure is illustrated in FIG. 25.  In the embodiment of FIG. 25, a human machine interface (HMI) includes a multi-function gauge 414 having a full color display screen.  The gauge 414 includes an accessory
connector 2010 including USB connector port 2012 configured to be connected to a USB drive 2014.  USB drive 2014 illustratively provides software updates, GPS data, special mapping layers, or other data to the gauge 414.  In addition, the USB drive 2014

<br/><br/> The gauge 414 is illustratively connected to the user handheld mobile device 110 by a suitable connection, preferably a wireless connection such as a Bluetooth data link 2032, to provide communication between the gauge 414 and the mobile device
110.  Therefore, the gauge 414 is connected to the Internet 116 or other communication network to the plurality of data sources discussed herein through the mobile device 110.  In an illustrated embodiment, phone call and text information from a mobile
phone 110 is displayed on gauge 414 as illustrated at block 2034.  The information displayed on a display of gauge 414 illustratively includes cell signal strength, call notification, text information, an address book, or other information from the
mobile phone 110.  User inputs on gauge 414 are used to control functions of the mobile device 110.  Music can also be played from mobile device 110, through gauge 414, and speakers 2026.
<br/><br/> Streaming audio is provided to the mobile device 110 as illustrated at block 2036.  When a black box radio 2024 does not have Bluetooth capability, the streaming audio data is transmitted from mobile device 110 to gauge 414 and then through
audio output 2022 to the black box radio 2024.
<br/><br/> A mobile application 38 discussed above with reference to FIGS. 1-24 provides information such as map data, route information, location information, or buddy tracking, and other information to the mobile device 110.  In the embodiment of FIG.
25, the data from mobile application 2038 is transferred to the gauge 414 for display.  Inputs from the gauge 414 are transferred to the mobile device 110 to control features of the mobile application 2038.
<br/><br/> A real time route planning mobile application 2040 is used on mobile device 110 to plan and display the route information using inputs on gauge 414.  For instance, route planning software from Primordial may be used in application 2040.  In
addition, a vehicle data recording and diagnostics application 2042 such as a mobile digital wrench is controlled and viewed on the gauge 414 through the mobile device 110.
<br/><br/> A GPS module 2044 is also coupled to the gauge 414.  The GPS module 2044 provides location data to the gauge 414 for the mapping, route planning, or other functions described herein.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 26, in another embodiment of the present disclosure, a vehicle 3010 has a suspension located between a plurality of ground engaging members 3012 and a vehicle frame 3014.  The ground engaging members 3012 include wheels,
skis, guide tracks, treads or the like.  The suspension typically includes springs 3016 and shock absorbers 3018 coupled between the ground engaging members 3012 and the frame 3014.  The springs 3016 may include, for example, coil springs, leaf springs,
air springs or other gas springs.  The air or gas springs 3016 may be adjustable.  See, for example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,950,486 incorporated herein by reference.  The springs 3016 are often coupled between the vehicle frame 3014 and the ground engaging
members 3012 through an A-arm linkage or other type linkage.  Adjustable shock absorbers 3018 are also coupled between the ground engaging members 3012 and the vehicle frame 3014.  In an illustrated embodiment, a spring 3016 and shock 3018 are located
adjacent each of the ground engaging members 3012.  In an ATV, for example, four springs 3016 and adjustable shocks 3018 are provided adjacent each wheel 3012.  Some manufacturers offer adjustable springs 3016 in the form of either air springs or
hydraulic preload rings.  These adjustable springs 3016 allow the operator to adjust the ride height on the go.  However, a majority of ride comfort comes from the damping provided by shock absorbers 3018.
<br/><br/> In an illustrated embodiment, the adjustable shocks 3018 are electrically controlled shocks for adjusting damping characteristics of the shocks 3018.  An ECU or other controller 402 provides signals to adjust damping of the shocks 3018 in a
continuous or dynamic manner.  The adjustable shocks 3018 are illustratively adjustable to provide differing compression damping, rebound damping or both.  Additional details of control of the adjustable damping control system are described in U.S. 
Application No. 61/723,623, filed on Nov.  7, 2012, owned by the assignee of the present application, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> In an illustrated embodiment of the present disclosure, a gauge 414 provides a human machine user interface provided in a location easily accessible to the driver operating the vehicle.  Preferably, the gauge 414 is mounted adjacent the driver's
seat on the dashboard or integrated onto a display within the vehicle.  Gauge 414 includes user inputs discussed below to allow the driver or a passenger to manually adjust shock absorber 3018 damping during operation of the vehicle based on road
conditions that are encountered.  The display of gauge 414 displays information related to the shock absorber damping settings.
<br/><br/> In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 26, the ECU 402 also controls an electronic continuously variable transmission (ECVT) 3024 and an electronic power steering (EPS) 3025 of the vehicle 3010.  In an illustrated embodiment, the mobile device
110 or the gauge 414 is used to control performance features of the vehicle 3010 including the adjustable shocks 3018, the ECVT 3024, the EPS 3025, or other electronically controllable performance functions of the vehicle.
<br/><br/> The ECU 402 receives inputs from the gauge 414 or mobile device 110 to adjust the damping characteristics of the adjustable shocks 3018 or control the ECVT 3024 or EPS 3025.  The front and rear shock absorbers 3018 are independently adjustable
to adjust the ride characteristics of the vehicle 3010.
<br/><br/> A plurality of sensors are also coupled to the ECU 402.  For example, a global change accelerometer 3025 is coupled adjacent each ground engaging member 3012.  The accelerometer 3025 provides an output signal coupled to ECU 402.  The
accelerometers 3025 provide an output signal indicating movement of the ground engaging members and the suspension components 3016 and 3018 as the vehicle traverses different terrain.
<br/><br/> Additional sensors may include a vehicle speed sensor 3026, a steering sensor 3028 and a chassis accelerometer 3030 all having output signals coupled to the ECU 402.  Accelerometer 3030 is illustratively a three-axis accelerometer located on the
chassis to provide an indicating of forces on the vehicle during operation.  Additional sensors include a brake sensor 3032, a throttle position sensor 3034, a wheel speed sensor 36, and a gear selection sensor 3038.  Each of these sensors has an output
signal coupled to the ECU 402.  ECU 402 detects when a vehicle is upside down using accelerometer 3030 and sends a distress signal through mobile device 110.
<br/><br/> In one illustrated embodiment, the gauge 414 is used in a demonstration mode on a showroom floor.  The gauge 414 illustratively receives video or other information through USB port 12, video connection 16, or through handheld mobile device 110
to provide videos or other information on the display of gauge 414 for promotional purposes.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment of the present invention, the gauge 414 facilitates tracking of a vehicle.  The gauge 414 receives information from the various sensors shown in FIG. 26 and location data from the GPS input 2044 to track how the vehicle was
driven and where it was driven.  This "ride data" is stored locally and retrieved, for example, through USB port 12 or the data is sent through the mobile device 110 to a remote location for storage and processing.  Additional details of monitoring,
storing, and replaying ride data are disclosed in U.S.  Patent Publication No. 2010/0090797, owned by the assignee of the present application, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/> In one illustrated embodiment, an owner can monitor a fleet of vehicles to determine a location of each vehicle and how the vehicles have been driven.  In another embodiment, the gauge 414 is used to adjust vehicle settings, such as the springs
3016 or adjustable shocks 3018 of a suspension system or to adjust an electronic continuously variable transmission (ECVT) 3024 through the gauge 414.  Vehicle settings are illustratively based on an experience level of a driver of the vehicle, a route
the vehicle is being driven, or other factors.  For instance, different settings of the ECVT 3024, suspension system 3016, 3018 or other systems are provided depending on whether the vehicle is being operated on-road, on-trail, or off-trail.  In an
illustrated embodiment, components of the vehicle 3010 are adjusted automatically based on a location of the vehicle detected using GPS data.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the mobile device 110 provides a security device or security key for the vehicle through its communication with the gauge 414.  In an illustrated embodiment, the mobile device 110 includes a driver profile including age
and experience level.  The gauge 414 receives the driver profile information from the mobile device 110 and automatically sets vehicle settings such as the vehicle suspension, shifting patterns, etc. based upon the driver profile.
<br/><br/> In another illustrated embodiment, the gauge 414 receives vehicle information from the sensors shown in FIG. 26 and provides a timestamp on the vehicle kinematic data received.  This "ride data" is linked to a vehicle location on the route
through the GPS data and a timestamp of the time at which the vehicle was at the different locations.  Therefore, the vehicle can store all information associated with a ride and the user can replay the ride after it is over as discussed above.

<br/><br/> FIGS. 31-34 illustrate various mounting positions for the gauge 414 of the present disclosure.  In FIG. 31, the gauge 414 is mounted below an existing display 3070.  FIG. 32 illustrates the gauge 414 mounted on a front dashboard of a utility
vehicle.  FIG. 33 illustrates the gauge 414 mounted within a snowmobile.  FIG. 34 illustrates the gauge 414 mounted on an ATV.
<br/><br/> The system and method of the present disclosure expands the powersport experience by allowing vehicle users to plan a ride, experience a ride and then re-live the ride.  Before the ride, users plan the route and view simulations based on photos,
videos or other route information discussed above.  Illustrative simulation modes include: Trail riding Exploring globally Race the pros Simulated sound and feel a particular vehicle Gaming, racing with the pros in Snow cross, Motocross, etc.: Links to
allow on-line shopping.  The user can purchase equipment and accessories for the user's vehicle on-line.
<br/><br/> The system and method of the present disclosure builds a user's excitement and anticipation before a ride.  The user plans the trip with map software including snowmobile and ATV trail information.  The trail database includes pictures of points
of interest, linked to the map.  The user also plans entertainment, music, and information, weather radio etc, and trail boss link to companions.  The user simulates all or part of the ride on a PC, or the gauge display, which provides a graphic
simulation of the ride, scenery, trail conditions and obstacles.
<br/><br/> The user uses a stored ride plan including route information, entertainment, and information flow by loading the stored plan into vehicle systems such as through USB connector 2012.  A digital camera or video camera 2018 allows the user to
record highlights of the ride linked to the GPS position.  During the ride, the system generates a trip log recording actual route, digital photos or videos.  Entertainment, and communications are indexed in time and recorded.  Sensor readings are also
indexed in time to show performance of the vehicle on the ride.
<br/><br/> After the ride, the user relives the experience and shares it with others.  The user brings an electronic log back to the PC based simulation so that the experience can be relived and shared with others.  Indexed to time the simulation include:
GPS position Trail conditions Weather Communication as it happens The music or entertainment that was playing Photos and videos taken at points of interest
<br/><br/> Cellular phone coverage is often not available at locations where recreational vehicles travel.  A navigation and traffic alert system is provided for recreational vehicle applications, such as off road vehicles, ATVs, UTVs, and snowmobiles. 
The system identifies location, direction, and speed of other similar vehicles on roads, trails and in open terrain.  This allows for buddy tracking, fleet management, and traffic alerts to similarly equipped vehicles remotely or in organized ride park
environments.  The illustrated system manages available communications networks based on their availability to provide the best information available: a. Vehicle system links to smart phones, GPS, and other devices through a Bluetooth or other similar
communication link to share information and access local and global information networks.  b. The system continuously assesses available networks and utilizes the best network available to transfer data for vehicle and remote services use.  Examples of
links could include cellular service, satellite communications, Wifi, GMRS radio, and any other available data service.  c. When no other source of vehicle-to-vehicle communication is available, the system of the present disclosure establishes a local
radio transceiver based network using frequencies such as GMRS band to share vehicle location, direction, and speed with similarly equipped vehicles.  This allows for group ride buddy tracking, ride park management, and alerts each vehicle to the
approach of other vehicles and safety hazards.  Alternatively, a fixed base radio transceiver could be used in a ride park like setting to share data with vehicle transceivers to facilitate 2 way communications.  Additional information such as radar
weather or general trail conditions and traffic is relayed to all vehicles on the network and displayed and/or used as appropriate.  d. When no outside network data is available, including potentially GPS or other locator data, the system predicts, or
dead reckons locations of the vehicle, obstacles, and other traffic.  e. An illustrated embodiment of the system incorporates a feature similar to 406 MHz distress transmitters to provide a call for help when other communications aren't available.
<br/><br/> In an additional embodiment of the present invention, the system sets a maximum speed for the vehicle based upon driver experience or a location of the vehicle on a planned route.  In addition, the maximum speed may be set depending upon an
operation being performed by the vehicle such as mowing or fertilizing.  A fleet owner can set a maximum speed for users of a fleet of vehicles.
<br/><br/> Different components of the vehicle, such as the adjustable shocks 3018, the ECVT 3024, the EPS 3025 or other system components such as an electronic transmission control may be adjusted on the fly during a trip.  For example, street mode, a
trail mode, an off-trail mode, a rock crawling mode, or other modes may be set for particular driving conditions.  These adjustments are automatically made as the vehicle passes over a route or are selected by user using mobile device 110 or gauge 414. 
In addition, a fuel saving mode may be set for road or trail use, while a maximum performance mode may be set for off-trail sections of the route.  A clutching chart is provided for snowmobiles at different elevations.
<br/><br/> In an illustrated embodiment, detected engine faults are displayed on the display screen of gauge 414 or mobile device 110.  A likely cause of the fault and possible corrective actions to be taken on the trail are also displayed on the gauge 414
or mobile device 110.  The integrated mapping system displays dealer locations and additional information such as phone numbers to provide service, help or parts along the route.  The mapping system provides a distance to the nearest dealer from the
location of the vehicle.  In one embodiment, a dealer inventory is checked to determine whether a particular part is available at a particular dealer.
<br/><br/> As discussed above, the system provides live updates through the mobile device 110 to the gauge 414 for weather or road conditions and provides overlays on the route map.  For example, snow conditions, weather alerts, traffic alerts, or
avalanche advisories are provided.
<br/><br/> The gauge 414 is integrated into the vehicle in certain embodiments.  In other embodiments, the gauge 414 is modular and can be removed from one vehicle, such as a utility vehicle, all terrain vehicle, or snowmobile and placed into another
vehicle.  Security such as using vehicle identification numbers is provided to reduce theft of the modular gauge 414.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the mobile device 110 includes a control option for remotely starting the vehicle or opening a garage door through communication with the gauge 414.  A GPS clock or Smartphone clock is illustratively used to control
contrast on a display of gauge 414.
