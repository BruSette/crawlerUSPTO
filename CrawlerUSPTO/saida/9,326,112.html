       <p> A network device receives a message that identifies a relationship
     between a first user device and a second user device, the relationship
     permitting status information of the first user device to be sent to the
     second user device when the first user device is communicating with a
     third user device. The network device receives the status information
     relating to a communication involving the first user device. The network
     device determines to send the status information to the second user
     device, based on the information identifying the relationship stored by
     the network device; and the network device sends the status information
     for presentation on the second user device.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> The following detailed description of example embodiments refers to the accompanying drawings.  The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.
<br/><br/> Systems and/or methods described herein may set up and create a profile to permit user device status information, regarding a first user device, to be sent to one or more second user devices (e.g., a set top box, a mobile communication device,
etc.).  The user device status information may include information about that the first user device is busy communicating with a third user device.  Further, the user device status information may include information identifying the third user device
with which the first user device is communicating.  Further, in addition to sending the user device status information, the one or more second user devices may be given an option to receive to a time-delayed recording of a voice communication between the
first user device and the third user device.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a diagram of an overview 100 of an example implementation described herein.  As shown in FIG. 1, the example implementation may include Jane's smart phone, Tom's smart phone, Bill's smart phone, a memory device, and a network.  Assume
that Tom sets up a profile (e.g., using a website on his laptop) to permit information regarding the status of his smart phone (Tom's smart phone) to be sent to Bill's smart phone when Tom is using his smart phone to communicate with another individual. 
Further, assume that Tom decides (using the profile) to allow Bill's smart phone to receive the option to listen to a time-delayed recording of outgoing and/or incoming communications involving Tom's smart phone.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 1, Tom uses his smart phone to call Jane.  Jane views the call request from Tom on her smart phone.  Jane (using Jane's smart phone) accepts the request from Tom's smart phone.  While Tom is on the call with Jane, the voice
conversation may be sent to the memory device.  The memory device may store the voice conversation between Tom and Jane.  The stored voice conversation may be a recording of the voice conservation between Tom and Jane.
<br/><br/> As Tom and Jane are talking to each other (using their respective smart phones), Bill decides to call Tom.  Bill uses his smart phone to contact Tom's smart phone, via the network.  Since Tom's smart phone is communicating with Jane's smart
phone, a message may appear on Bill's smart phone indicating that Tom's smart phone is busy with a phone call with Jane, and may also present an option to listen to the voice conversation ("Tom is in a call with Jane--would you like to listen?").  Bill
may listen to a time-delayed recording (stored in the memory device) of the voice conversation between Tom and Jane.  To receive the time-delayed recording, Bill's smart phone may communicate, via the network, with the memory device.  The memory device
may send the time-delayed recording, via the network, to Bill's smart phone.
<br/><br/> As a result, particular users of user devices may be able to obtain the status of a particular user device, when the particular user device is engaged in a communication with another user device.  Further, users of user devices may be able to
listen to a time-delayed recording of a voice communication between the particular user device and another user device.  This may allow the user, of the particular user device, to keep other users updated on the current status of the user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example environment 200, in which systems and/or methods described herein may be implemented.  As shown in FIG. 2, environment 200 may include a user device 205, a user device 210, a user device 215, a user device 220,

<br/><br/> The quantity of devices and/or networks illustrated in FIG. 2 is provided for explanatory purposes only.  In practice, there may be additional devices and/or networks; fewer devices and/or networks; different devices and/or networks; or
differently arranged devices and/or networks than illustrated in FIG. 2.  Also, in some implementations, one or more of the devices in environment 200 may perform one or more functions described as being performed by another one or more of the devices in
environment 200.  Devices of environment 200 may interconnect via wired connections, wireless connections, or a combination of wired and wireless connections.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a diagram of example components of a device 300.  Device 300 may correspond to user devices 205, 210, 215, and 220, client device 225, display device 230, user status server 235, memory device 240, HLR/switch 245, and/or provider 265. 
Alternatively, or additionally, each of user devices 205, 210, 215, and 220, client device 225, display device 230, user status server 235, memory device 240, HLR/switch 245, and/or provider 265 may include one or more devices 300 and/or one or more
components of device 300.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 3, device 300 may include a bus 310, a processor 320, a memory 330, an input component 340, an output component 350, and a communication interface 360.
<br/><br/> Bus 310 may include a path that permits communication among the components of device 300.  Processor 320 may include one or more processors, microprocessors, or processing logic (e.g., a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application
specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) that interprets and executes instructions.  Memory 330 may include any type of dynamic storage device that stores information and instructions, for execution by processor 320, and/or any type of non-volatile storage
device that stores information for use by processor 320.
<br/><br/> Input component 340 may include a component that permits a user to input information to device 300, such as a keyboard, a keypad, a button, a switch, etc. Output component 350 may include a component that outputs information to the user, such as
a display, a speaker, one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs), etc.
<br/><br/> Communication interface 360 may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables device 300 to communicate with other devices and/or systems.  For example, communication interface 360 may include an Ethernet interface, an optical interface, a
coaxial interface, a wireless interface, or the like.
<br/><br/> In another implementation, communication interface 360 may include, for example, a transmitter that may convert baseband signals from processor 320 to radio frequency (RF) signals and/or a receiver that may convert RF signals to baseband
signals.  Alternatively, communication interface 360 may include a transceiver to perform functions of both a transmitter and a receiver of wireless communications (e.g., radio frequency, infrared, visual optics, etc.), wired communications (e.g.,
conductive wire, twisted pair cable, coaxial cable, transmission line, fiber optic cable, waveguide, etc.), or a combination of wireless and wired communications.
<br/><br/> Communication interface 360 may connect to an antenna assembly (not shown in FIG. 3) for transmission and/or reception of the RF signals.  The antenna assembly may include one or more antennas to transmit and/or receive RF signals over the air. 
The antenna assembly may, for example, receive RF signals from communication interface 360 and transmit the RF signals over the air, and receive RF signals over the air and provide the RF signals to communication interface 360.  In one implementation,
for example, communication interface 360 may communicate with network 250 (and/or network 260) and/or devices connected to network 250 (and/or network 260).
<br/><br/> As will be described in detail below, device 300 may perform certain operations.  Device 300 may perform these operations in response to processor 320 executing software instructions (e.g., computer program(s)) contained in a computer-readable
medium, such as memory 330, a secondary storage device (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, etc.), or other forms of RAM or ROM.  A computer-readable medium may be defined as a non-transitory memory device.  A memory device may include space within a single
physical storage device or spread across multiple physical storage devices.  The software instructions may be read into memory 330 from another computer-readable medium or from another device.  The software instructions contained in memory 330 may cause
processor 320 to perform processes described herein.  Alternatively, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes described herein.  Thus, implementations described herein are not limited
to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
<br/><br/> While FIG. 3 shows device 300 as having a particular quantity and arrangement of components, in other implementations, device 300 may contain fewer components, additional components, different components, or differently arranged components than
depicted in FIG. 3.  Additionally, or alternatively, one or more components of device 300 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more components of device 300.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process 400 for sending user device status information.  In one implementation, process 400 may be performed by user status server 235.  In another example implementation, one or more blocks of process 400
may be performed by one or more other devices, such as user device 205, user device 210, user device 215, user device 220, client device 225, and/or memory device 240.
<br/><br/> Process 400 may include receiving configuration information (block 410).  User status server 235 may receive configuration information from a user device, such as user device 210.  A user, using user device 210, may decide, via a user interface
(e.g., a web page) to set-up a profile to configure various devices to receive status information of a user device, such as user device 205.  The user may enter login information (e.g., user name and password) into user device 210 to allow the user to
login into the user's account (associated with the service provider of network 250) to set-up the configuration.  User device 210 may send the login information to user status server 235.  User status server 235 may verify the login information to
determine that the login information is valid and may send a message, indicating such, to user device 210.  The user may view the message, on user device 210, that the user is successfully logged into the account.
<br/><br/> The user may select one or more user devices from a first list of user devices (e.g., cell phone, smart phone, etc.) displayed, for example, in the profile set-up page on user device 210.  The user may choose a user device (such as user device
205) from the first list that will allow other user devices to obtain the status of the selected user device.  For example, if the user selects user device 205, then the user has decided that when user device 205 is in use (e.g., for incoming and/or
outgoing phone calls), another user device may receive a message indicating that user device 205 is in use.  Additionally or alternatively, the user may select, from the first list, an application (e.g., voice over IP (VoIP)) that is associated with a
user device (such as user device 210).  For example, if the user selects a VoIP application (such as Skype), then the user has decided that when the user is using the VoIP application, one or more other devices may receive a message indicating that the
user is using the VoIP application.
<br/><br/> The user may also be given a second list of user devices and/or client devices (e.g., displayed in the profile set-up page on user device 210) that may (if selected by the user) receive the status of the selected user device from the first list
as described above.  For example, the user may select a set top box (e.g., client device 225) to receive the status of the selected user device, (e.g., user device 205).  Each user device on the second list may have a respective identifier (e.g., phone
number, device identifier, etc.).  One or more of the user devices and/or client devices on the second list may be associated with a different user.  One or more of the user devices and/or client devices, on the second list, may be associated with the
service provider of network 250 (and user status server 235), and/or one or more of the user devices and/or client devices may be associated with a different service provider.
<br/><br/> Instead of selecting a client device and/or a user device from the second list, the user may be given the option, via the profile set-up page, to enter a phone number (or another identifier) for a user device that may receive the status
information of user device 205.  For example, the user may enter a phone number for a smart phone (e.g., associated with the same subscriber, a different subscriber and/or a different network service provider) to receive the status information of user
device 205.
<br/><br/> The user may also be given a third list of applications (e.g., displayed in the profile set-up page on user device 210) associated with the second list of user devices that may (if selected by the user) receive the status of the selected user
device when the application is being used (or logged in) on the selected user device.  Each application may be associated with a particular provider 265.  For example, if the user selects Twitter, then when the user is using or logged into Twitter (on
user device 210) at the same time the user (using user device 205) is on a phone call with a user of user device 220, a message may appear within the user's Twitter page that user device 205 is communicating with user device 220.  The message may also be
visible to other Twitter users who have permission to view the user's Twitter account messages.
<br/><br/> The user may have an option to determine an interval of time when the status information may be sent.  For example, the user may select that status information can only be sent to a set top box (client device 225) from 5:00 p.m.  to 10:00 p.m.,
on Mondays, on weekends, etc.
<br/><br/> The user may have an option to suspend sending the status information to other user devices (e.g., user device 215 and/or user device 220).  For example, the user may decide to suspend sending status information to a set top box (e.g., client
device 225) for a one week interval of time in December.  Before, and after, the one week interval of time, the set top box may receive the status information.  The user may also be able to suspend sending status information to a set top box during a
specific television program (e.g., no status information alerts during the football game on a specified television channel).
<br/><br/> The user may also specify, using the profile set-up page, which user devices and/or client devices, in the second list, may receive a time-delayed recording of a voice communication between user device 205 and another user device.  The user
devices and/or client devices permitted to listen in may be different from the user devices and/or client devices permitted to receive the status information of user device 205.  The time-delayed recording of a voice communication may be associated with
incoming and/or outgoing phone calls involving user device 205 to other user devices (e.g., such as user device 215 or user device 220).  This may allow another user to listen to the voice conversation between the user (of user device 205) and a user of
the other user device, such as user device 215.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the user may specify that when a user device, selected from the first list, is involved in call with a particular recipient, the other user devices and/or client devices, selected from the second list, may receive the time-delayed
recording of the voice conversation only for that particular recipient.  For example, the user may specify that a selected user device and/or client device, from the second list, may only receive time-delayed recordings associated with emergency phone
calls (e.g., 911 phone calls).
<br/><br/> The user may also use the profile set-up page to change which user devices (e.g., user devices 210, 215, and/or 220), and/or client devices 225 are to receive the status information of a particular user device (e.g., user device 205) and when
the status information (for user device 205) may be sent to other user devices and/or client devices.  Alternatively, the user may use the profile to stop sending the status information of the particular user device to other user devices and/or client
devices.
<br/><br/> User device 210 may send the configuration information, regarding which user devices (from the first list) are to send their status information to selected user devices and/or client devices, from the second list, to user status server 235. 
User status server 235 may receive the configuration information.
<br/><br/> User status server 235 may store the configuration information.  User status server 235 may identify one or more multiple network devices that are configured to receive the configuration information.  User status server 235 may send a
provisioning message that includes the configuration information to one or more network devices and/or switches (e.g., HLR/switch 245).  The other network devices and/or switches may notify user status server 235 when one or more of the selected user
devices and/or clients devices (based on the configuration as described above) are communicating with each other or are attempting to communicate with each other.
<br/><br/> User status server 235 may send the configuration information to provider 265.  For example, if the user selected (using the third list in the profile set-up page) a particular application to receive the status information, then user status
server 235 may send the configuration information to a provider, such as provider 265, associated with the particular application.  Provider 265 may store the configuration information.  Provider 265 may use the configuration information to determine
when to include the status information of a user device (e.g., user device 205) selected from the first list when the particular application (selected from the third list) is being used on a user device (e.g., user device 215).
<br/><br/> Process 400 may include receiving a status of a user device (block 420).  For example, a user of user device 205 may be using user device 205 for a voice communication with user device 220, via network devices and/or switches (e.g., HLR/switch
245) in network 250 and/or network 260.  The network devices and/or switches may send information to user status server 235 that user device 205 is in use.  User status server 235 may store the status information of user device 205.  Once user device 205
stops the voice communication with user device 220, user status server 235 may be informed by the other network devices and/or switches regarding the change in the status information.  User status server 235 may change the status information of user
device 205 to being available for communication.  Additionally, or alternatively, a user of user device 205 may be using a VoIP application, via network devices in network 250 and/or network 260.  The network devices may send information to user status
server 235 that user device 205 is being used for VoIP.
<br/><br/> Process 400 may include sending the status of the user device (block 430).  For example, user device 215 may request to communicate with user device 205, via network devices and/or switches associated with network 250.  User device 205 may be
busy communicating with user device 220, as described in block 420.  User status server 235 may receive, from one of the network devices and/or switches, information regarding the request from user device 215.  User status server 235 may determine (as
described in block 420) that user device 205 is busy.  User status server 235 may determine based on the configuration information, stored by status server 235, which user devices and/or client devices are permitted to receive the status of user device
205.  User status server 235 may determine, based on the configuration information, that user device 215 may receive the status information of user device 205.  If user device 215 is not permitted to receive the status information of user device 205,
then user status server 235 may send a notification (via other network devices in network 250) to user device 215 that user device 215 is not permitted to receive the status information.
<br/><br/> User status server 235 may send, via network devices and/or switches associated with network 250, the status information of user device 205 to user device 215.
<br/><br/> The status information may include identification information regarding user device 220 that is in communication with user device 205.  The status information may include a name, phone number, and/or other types of information (e.g., the status
information may be "Tom is busy in a call with (305)555-1212").  User device 215 may have an application (associated with user status server 235) that permits user device 215 to receive the status information and display the status information.
<br/><br/> Additionally, or alternatively, user status server 235 may send the status information to other user devices and/or client devices selected from the second list via network 250 and/or network 260 (e.g., using HLR/switch 245).  For example, when
user device 205 is busy (e.g., user device 205 is being used to make a call, user device 205 is being used for a VoIP communication), user status server 235 may determine, based on the configuration information described in block 410, that the status
information (e.g., "Tom is busy with on a call with Jane" or "Tom is using Skype") of user device 205 is to be sent to client device 225 without receiving a request from client device 225 to obtain the status information.
<br/><br/> Additionally, or alternatively, user status server 235 may determine which selected user devices and/or client devices may receive the status information based on whether selected user devices and/or client devices are using a particular
application (selected by the user in the profile set-up page, as described with regard to block 410).  For example, if a particular application (e.g., a social networking application) was selected, as described in block 410, then the status information
of user device 205 may be sent as a message within the particular application being used on a user device, such as user device 210.
<br/><br/> For example, the user may be using or may be logged into a social networking service (provided by provider 265) on user device 210 while the user is also involved in a phone call using user device 205.  User device 210 may be receiving the
social networking service content from provider 265, via one or more network devices associated with network 250.  The one or more network devices may notify user status server 235 that user device 210 is using the social networking service.  User status
server 235 may determine, based on the configuration in block 410, that the status information is to be provided within the content and/or information associated with the social networking service.  User status server 235 may notify provider 265 to
include the status information of user device 205 within the content and/or information being sent from provider 265 to user device 210.
<br/><br/> Provider 265 may receive the notification and may determine, based on the configuration information (described with regard to block 410), to send the status information as a message within the content associated with the social networking
service to user device 210.  The social networking service may also allow other users of the social networking service, who have permission from the user of user device 210, to receive the user's status information on the social networking service.
<br/><br/> While a series of blocks has been described with regard to FIG. 4, the order of the blocks may be modified in other implementations.  Further, non-dependent blocks may be performed in parallel.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an example process 500 for sending time-delayed recordings of voice communications relating to a phone call.  In one implementation, process 500 may be performed by user status server 235.  In another example
implementation, one or more blocks of process 500 may be performed by one or more other devices, such as memory device 240.
<br/><br/> Process 500 may include receiving a request to send a time-delayed recording of a voice communication (block 510).  User status server 235 may receive a request from a user device and/or a client device to send a time-delayed recording of a
voice communication to the user device and/or client device.  The voice communication may be between a user device, selected from the first list (described with regard to block 410 in FIG. 4) and another user device.
<br/><br/> For example, user device 215 may receive, from user status server 235, the status information of user device 205 when user device 205 is busy communicating with user device 220 (described with regard to block 430 in FIG. 4).  The status
information may include (based on the configuration information stored in user status server 235, described with regard to block 410) an option for a user, of user device 215, to listen to a time-delayed recording of a voice communication between user
device 205 and user device 220 (e.g., "Tom is busy talking to Jane, would you like to listen?").  The user of user device 215 may decide to listen to the time-delayed recording.  The user of user device 215 may input a command into user device 215 that
the user would like to listen to the time-delayed recording.  User device 215 may receive the command and may send the request to user status server 235.  User status server 235 may determine that, user device 215 may receive the time-delayed recording
based on the configuration information (described with regard to block 410 in FIG. 4).
<br/><br/> Process 500 may include sending the time-delayed recording of the voice communication (block 520).  User status server 235 may have stored the configuration information (described with regard to block 410 in FIG. 4) regarding which selected user
devices and/or client devices are permitted to receive the time-delayed recordings of voice communications associated with user device 205.  User status server 235 may communicate with memory device 240, via network 250, to receive the time-delayed
recording.
<br/><br/> Memory device 240 may receive the voice communication information via user status server 235, while the user of user device 205 is having a voice communication with user device 220.  User status server 235 may, based on the configuration
information (described with regard to block 410), send the voice communication information to memory device 240.  As there may be a time associated with sending the voice communication information to memory device 240 (from user device 205), the
recording of the voice communication information (in memory device 240) may be a time-delayed recording of the voice communication between user device 205 and another user device.
<br/><br/> Memory device 240 may store the voice communication between user device 205 and user device 220.  The time-delayed voice recording stored in memory device 240 may be removed based on a request by the user, of user device 205, (via the user's
profile page) that the time-delayed recording be deleted.  Alternatively, the time-delayed recording stored in memory device 240 may expire at a specified period of time (e.g., after 30 days, the time-delayed recording may be deleted from memory device
240; after the call completes the time-delayed recording, associated with the call, may be deleted from memory 240; etc.).
<br/><br/> In one example implementation, memory device 240 may send the time-delayed recording to user status server 235.  User status server 235 may receive the time-delayed recording and send the time-delayed recording, via network devices associated
with network 250, to user device 215.  In another example implementation, memory device 240 may send the time-delayed recording to user device 215, via network devices associated with network 250.
<br/><br/> Additionally, or alternatively, user status server 235 may send the time-delayed recording to other selected user devices and/or client devices (according to the configuration information described in block 410 in FIG. 4) based on requests from
the other selected user devices and/or client devices.  User status server 235 may communicate with the other selected user devices and/or client devices via network 250 and/or network 260 (e.g., using HLR/switch 245).
<br/><br/> The time-delayed recording may be transcoded to allow users using different types of devices to listen to the time-delayed voice recording.  For example, client device 225 may transcode the time-delayed recording to allow a user of a display
device 230 (e.g., a television) to listen to the time-delayed recording.  The user, receiving the time-delayed recording, may use various user controls, such as pausing, forwarding, rewinding, and stopping, to listen to the time-delayed recording.
<br/><br/> While a series of blocks has been described with regard to FIG. 5, the order of the blocks may be modified in other implementations.  Further, non-dependent blocks may be performed in parallel.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 6A-6B are diagrams of an example process for sending user device status information.  FIG. 6A shows user device 605, user device 610, user device 615, and client device 630; and FIG. 6B shows user status server 235, memory device 240,
network 250, user device 605, user device 615, client device 630 and display device 640.  User device 610 may correspond to user device 210, described with regard to FIG. 2.  User device 605 may correspond to user device 205, described with regard to
FIG. 2.  User device 615 may correspond to user device 215, described with regard to FIG. 2.  User device 630 may correspond to user device 230, described with regard to FIG. 2.  Display device 640 may correspond to user device 240, described with regard
to FIG. 2.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 6A, a user ("Mary"), of user device 610, decides to set up a configuration of different user devices to receive status information regarding her own smart phone (user device 605) when Mary is using her smart phone to communicate with
other user devices.  Mary decides that she would like to have Tom's smart phone (user device 615) and the set top box (client device 630) in Mary's living room to receive the status information.  Additionally, Mary decides that she would like Tom to also
receive a time-delayed recording of a voice communication whenever Mary is making a 911 emergency call from user device 605.  Assume that user device 605, user device 615, and client device 630 are all provided services by the same network service
provider.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 6B, Mary's sister, Beth, is working out in front of the living room television in Mary's house.  Mary is outside a shopping mall when she witnesses a robbery in the parking lot.  Mary decides to call the police by dialing 911. 
When Mary begins to communicate with the police, via 911, information, regarding the communication, is sent to user status server 235.  User status server 235 may receive the message and determine, based on the configuration information in FIG. 6A, to
send a message to client device 630, via network 250.  Client device 630 may send the message to display device 640 and Beth may view the message (Mary busy calling 911) on display device 640.  Since Mary did not select providing the option to listen to
the time-delayed voice conversation on the set top box, Beth does not have the ability to select that particular option on display device 640.  At the same time, based on the configuration, user status server 235 may send the voice communication between
Mary and the police to memory device 240.  Memory device 240 may store the voice communication.
<br/><br/> Tom (using user device 615) may attempt to communicate with Mary.  When user device 615 requests to communicate with user device 605, information regarding the request is sent to user status server 235.  User status server 235 may determine that
user device 605 is busy.  User status server 235 may determine (based on Tom's MDN or another identifier) that a notification be sent to user device 615 indicating the status of user device 605.  User status server 235 may also determine that user device
615 may also (based on the configuration information) receive time-delayed voice recordings when user device 605 is being used to make 911 phone calls.
<br/><br/> User status server 235 may send a message, via network 250, to user device 615 indicating that user device 605 is busy and that Tom (the user of user device 615) may listen to the phone conversation.  Thus, Tom may view on his smart phone (user
device 605) the message "Mary busy talking with 911, listen?" Tom may decide that he would like to listen to the time-delayed recording of the voice conversation between Mary and the police, so Tom selects the "YES" option.
<br/><br/> User device 615 may send a request to user status server 235 that user device 615 would like to receive the time-delayed recording regarding the 911 phone call being made by user device 605.  User status server 235 may receive the request and
send a notification, via network 250, to memory device 240.  Memory device 240 may send the time-delayed recording of the voice communication (between Mary and the police) to user device 615 until the voice conversation (by Mary) ends or when Tom decides
that he does not wish to listen anymore.
<br/><br/> As a result, particular users of user devices may be able to obtain the status of a particular user device, when the particular user device is engaged in a communication with another user device.  Further, users of user devices may be able to
listen to a time-delayed recording of a voice communication between the particular user device and another user device.  This may allow the user, of the particular user device, to keep other users updated on the current status of the user.
<br/><br/> The foregoing description of implementations provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the implementations to the precise form disclosed.  Modifications and variations are possible in light of the
above disclosure or may be acquired from practice of the implementations.
<br/><br/> It will be apparent that systems and/or methods, as described herein, may be implemented in many different forms of software, firmware, and hardware in the implementations illustrated in the figures.  The actual software code or specialized
