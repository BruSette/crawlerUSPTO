       <p> A portable device including a gesture recognizer module for automatically
     detecting a specific sequence of gestures is described. The portable
     device may be used to detect a health, safety, or security related event.
     The portable device may further include an emergency event module for
     automatically determining whether the sequence of gestures corresponds to
     an emergency event. The portable device may further include a proximity
     detection module for automatically determining whether a mobile device
     corresponding to a user listed as an emergency contact is in a state of
     proximity to the portable device. The portable device may further include
     a notification module for automatically transmitting a message,
     indicating the emergency event, to the user of the mobile device
     determined to be in the state of proximity.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Seeing a need for a quick, universal way to call for help, government agencies began the widespread adoption of "911" as a single emergency telephone number in the 1980s.  Landline phones were the primary way to call 911 for years.  The
proliferation of cell phones and smartphones have made emergency assistance even more easily obtainable, particularly when one is away from a traditional landline phone.
<br/><br/> Despite the ubiquity of smartphones, dialing 911 from one still has barriers that may be difficult, time-consuming, or even impossible--particularly in the very emergency situations in which one is most likely to dial 911.  One may need to turn
on the phone, unlock the screen, open the dialing application, and then actually dial 911--which can use valuable time.  In some cases, there might be an easy way to dial 911 (such as the "emergency" option on a Blackberry, or a 911Now app for Android
phones), but even those would require the phone to be on, the screen unlocked, manual dexterity, and moderate vision capabilities.  To address these deficiencies, in one embodiment, an HSS device 10 is described that provides a way for people to tap a
"Morse-like" code onto any HSS device's (for example, mobile phone or smartphone) screen, whether the device is on, on with a locked screen, has a "dead" battery, or is turned off.  This would be useful in a situation where someone has limited vision,
mobility, or dexterity (such as being bound and gagged in the trunk of a car) and needs to call for emergency assistance.  Rather than fumbling to turn on the phone, unlocking the screen, pulling up the dialing application, and then dialing 911 onto a
digital dial pad screen image (without the tactile cues of a push-button dial pad), a person could tap a pre-programmed code (e.g., two long taps followed by 2 short taps) to automatically dial 911 or automatically perform a more complex emergency
sequence.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary HSS device 10 that may be an exemplary portable device.  Without limitations, such portable device may be any device that can be carried by a person, such as a handheld device or a wearable device. 
In one embodiment, HSS device 10 may include a processor 12, memory 14, camera 16, and user input devices 18, touch screen display 20, network interfaces 22, sensors 24, battery 26, and reserve battery 28.  Each of these components may be connected to
each other (as needed for the functionality of HSS device 10) via a bus system 30.  Exemplary HSS devices include a smartphone, such as an iPhone, a smart watch, or any other device that an individual may have on their person, including, smart
eyeglasses, shoes, or other wearable devices.  Processor 12 may execute instructions stored in memory 14.  Camera 16 may capture both still and moving images.  User input devices, include haptic devices, such as keyboards or buttons, and touch screens. 
Touch screen display 20 may be any type of display, such as LCD, LED, or other types of display.  As an example, touch screen display 20 may be a capacitive touch screen.  The touch screen (e.g., display 20) can detect touch events, such as tapping on
the screen or swiping on the screen.  In response to such events, in combination with other modules, described later, touch image data may be generated and submitted to processor 12.  In addition to, or in the alternative to processor 12, other
processors, such as touch screen controllers may also be used to recognize taps or swipes.  Additional details regarding touch image data acquisition and processing are described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,323,846, which is incorporated by reference herein in
its entirety.  Network interfaces may include communication interfaces, such as cellular radio, Bluetooth radio, UWB radio, or other types of wireless or wired communication interfaces.  Sensors 24 may include a variety of sensors, such as
accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS, and proximity sensors.  Battery 26 may be any portable battery, such as a chargeable lithium-ion battery.  Reserve battery 28 may also be any portable battery, such as a chargeable lithium-ion battery.  Although FIG. 1
shows a specific number of components arranged in a certain manner, HSS device 10 may include additional or fewer components arranged differently.  In addition, HSS device 10 need not be a dedicated device for health, safety, and security functions;
instead it could be a mobile phone, a smart watch, an augmented reality device (e.g., Google Glass) or any other wearable or portable device.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 shows an exemplary environment 100 in which the methods associated with HSS device 10 may be performed.  HSS device 10 may communicate with wireless networks 110.  Wireless networks 110 may include cellular networks, Wi-Fi networks,
Personal Area Networks, such as Bluetooth, or other types of wireless networks.  Wireless networks 110 may include not only communication apparatus, such as cell sites, but also cloud computing infrastructure.  The cloud computing infrastructure may be
used to provide additional computing and storage functionality to HSS device 10.  HSS device 10 may also communicate with sensor networks 120.  Sensor networks may allow HSS device 10 to engage in machine-to-machine communication.  While FIG. 2 shows
separate sensor networks 120, the functionality related to these networks may be included in wireless networks 110.  Via wireless networks 110, and as needed, via sensor networks 120, HSS device 10 may also communicate with additional smart devices
either worn by a user of HSS device 10 or carried by the user of HSS device 10.  As an example, the user may have smart glasses 150, a wearable electronics device 130, or smart footwear 140 on their person.  Each of these devices may communicate with HSS
device 10 via wireless networks 110 or sensor networks 120.  Each of these devices may have the same or similar functionality and modules as described for HSS device 10.  Thus, for example, wearable electronics device 130 may be part of the clothing worn
by the user and that might be the only device on the user's person and still provide all or most of the functions related to HSS device 10.  In one embodiment, smart footwear 140 may have several sensors, controllers, and memory embedded in them.  As an
example, these components may be part of an integrated circuit coupled to antenna.  These components may be housed in the sole of the footwear.  A battery may also be included in the sole to power these components.  Additional details regarding smart
footwear with sensors are described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,676,541, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.  As an example, FIG. 6 of the '541 patent and related description describe similar components embedded in the sole of footwear. 
The memory component of smart footwear 140 may include instructions, which when executed by a processor, may provide functionality associated with smart footwear 140.  Smart glasses 150 may have several sensors, controllers, and memory embedded in them. 
As an example, these components may be part of an integrated circuit coupled to antenna.  These components may be housed in the frame of the glasses or a housing attached to the frames.  A battery may also be included in the housing to power these
components.  Additional details of smart glasses 150 are described in U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2014/0218269, which is based on application Ser.  No. 13/762,146, filed on Feb.  7, 2013, which is incorporated by reference herein in its
entirety.  In particular, FIG. 7 of the '146 application and related description describe a head mounted device, which could form the basis of smart glasses 150.  Not all aspects depicted in FIG. 2 are needed for each method; instead some or all of the
aspects may be used.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram showing various exemplary modules for performing methods associated with HSS device 10 of FIG. 1.  In one embodiment, these modules may be stored in memory 14 of HSS device 10 and may contain software instructions
that when executed by processor 12 of HSS device 10 may provide the functionality associated with these modules.  In one embodiment, some or all of these modules may be a part of a downloadable application from the Internet, as an example from Apple's
iTunes store or Google's Google Play store.  Exemplary modules stored in memory may include a tap recognizer module 302, a swipe recognizer module 304, a gesture recognizer module 306, an emergency event module 310, a proximity detection module 312, a
sensor module 314, a notification module 316, and an operating system module 318.  Tap recognizer module 302 may include instructions that when executed by processor 12 may result in capturing touch screen data corresponding to the taps.  Additional
details regarding capturing key tap events and processing are described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,542,206, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.  In particular, FIG. 9 and related description of the '206 patent describe capturing image
data corresponding to key tap events.  In one embodiment, tap recognizer module 302 may differentiate between a tap with a short duration and a tap with a long duration.  This way, a user of HSS device 10 may enter a Morse-like code sequence.  Thus, for
example, a series of two short taps followed by a long tap, which is then followed by a series of two additional short taps may be the specific sequence that indicates an emergency event.  Indeed, other specific sequence of taps may also be used.  A user
of HSS device 10 may configure the device and provide the specific sequence of taps that would indicate an emergency event.  The taps entered via touch screen display 20 may be communicated to processor 12, which in turn may provide the data to emergency
event module 310.
<br/><br/> Swipe recognizer module 304 may include instructions that when executed by processor 12 may result in automatically capturing touch screen data corresponding to the swipes.  Additional details regarding capturing swipe events and processing are
described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,542,206, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.  In particular, FIG. 10 and related description of the '206 patent describe capturing image data corresponding to swipe events.  In one embodiment, swipe
recognizer module 304 may differentiate between a swipe to the left and a swipe to the right.  This way, a user of HSS device 10 may enter a specific swipe sequence.  Thus, for example, a series of two swipes to the left followed by two swipes to the
right may be the specific sequence that indicates an emergency event.  Indeed, other specific sequence of swipes may also be used.  A user of HSS device 10 may configure the device and provide the specific sequence of swipes that would indicate an
emergency event.  The swipes entered via touch screen display 20 may be communicated to processor 12, which in turn may provide the data to emergency event module 310.
<br/><br/> Gesture recognizer module 306 may include instructions that when executed by processor 12 may result in automatically capturing data corresponding to the gestures.  Additional details regarding capturing gesture events and processing are
described in U.S.  Patent Publication No. 2012/0146903, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.  In particular, FIG. 12 and related description of this publication describe recognizing various gesture events, such as move from left to
right or move from right to left.  In one embodiment, gesture recognizer module 306 may differentiate between a move from left to right and a move from right to left.  This way, a user of HSS device 10 may enter a specific gesture sequence.  Thus, for
example, two moves from left to right followed by two moves from right to left may be the specific sequence that indicates an emergency event.  Indeed, other specific sequence of gestures may also be used.  A user of HSS device 10 may configure the
device and provide the specific sequence of gestures that would indicate an emergency event.  The gestures recognized by gesture recognizer module 306 may be communicated to processor 12, which in turn may provide the data to emergency event module 310. 
While FIG. 3 describes these modules as separate modules, any of these modules can be combined or further separated in terms of functionality.  In addition, the specific sequence of taps, swipes, or gestures may be programmed by a user of HSS device 10
or by the supplier of such devices.  Alternatively, such sequences may be programmed by an application developer or a service provider for HSS device 10.
<br/><br/> With continued reference to FIG. 3, emergency event module 310 may be configured to automatically determine whether a specific sequence of taps, swipes, or gestures indicates an emergency event.  In one embodiment, emergency event module 310 may
receive the sequence of taps from tap recognizer module 302.  In another embodiment, emergency event module 310 may receive the sequence of swipes from swipe recognizer module 304.  In another embodiment, emergency event module 310 may receive the
sequence of gestures from gesture recognizer module 306.  In another embodiment, the specific sequence indicating an emergency event could be a sequence of taps, swipes, and/or gestures.  As an example, a sequence could be a tap followed by a swipe to
the left and then followed by a gesture indicating a move to the right.  The user of HSS device 10 may configure the device to recognize any such specific sequence and store the results in the memory of HSS device 10.  In another embodiment, a sequence
of hops or jumps could also indicate an emergency event.  As part of this example, smart footwear 140 may be configured to automatically detect hops or jumps and information regarding such hops and/or jumps may be automatically communicated to emergency
event module 310, which in turn may automatically determine whether the sequence of hop and/or jumps corresponds to an emergency event.  An exemplary sequence of hops and jumps may include two jumps followed by a hop to the left and a hop to the right. 
In another embodiment, a sequence could be a combination of taps, swipes, gestures, and/or jumps/hops.  In another embodiment, wearable electronics device 130 may be a wrist watch that could also be configured to detect a sequence of arm movements. 
Thus, for example, a sequence of arm movements indicating arm being moved up, then down, then up, and down again in a short period of time may indicate an emergency event.  In another embodiment, a sequence indicative of an emergency event could be a
combination of taps, swipes, gestures, jumps, hops, and/or arm movements.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, an indication of an emergency event may come automatically from a health monitoring sensor, such as a sensor for detecting a seizure.  In this embodiment, the user of HSS device 10 need not indicate an emergency event via
taps, swipes, gestures, jumps, hops or arm movements.  Instead, a seizure detection sensor may be included as part of a head band or a cap that a user with HSS device 10 may wear.  While this embodiment is described in reference to a sensor for detecting
seizure, the sensor could be any sensor that can detect a hazardous health condition, such as a heart attack, a stroke, a lack of consciousness, or other types of health conditions that might warrant an emergency response.  The seizure detection sensor
may be the type described in U.S.  Patent Publication 2012/0197092, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.  In particular, an EEG detection and an EEG control system, as described in FIGS. 2 and 3 and the related description of the
'092 patent publication may be incorporated in the head band or the cap worn by a user of HSS device 10.  In addition, steps 610 to 660 of FIG. 6 and related description in the '092 patent publication provide additional details regarding one example of
detecting a seizure event.  Upon the automatic detection of the seizure event, emergency event module 310 may automatically communicate with other modules, including proximity detection module 312 and notification module 318 in a similar manner as would
be the case when a user enters a specific sequence of taps indicating an emergency event.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, once emergency event module 310 automatically detects an emergency event, it might be configured to automatically dial an emergency number, such as 911.  The dialed emergency number may be a number other than 911 depending
upon the location of HSS device 10.  In one embodiment, HSS device 10 may automatically, in real-time, obtain information concerning the emergency number to dial depending upon the location of HSS device 10.  This could be accomplished using service side
functionality associated with wireless networks 110.  The location of HSS device 10 may be detected using GPS (as part of sensors 24) and may be processed by sensor module 314.  Sensor module 314 may format and pass this information to emergency event
module 310.  As an example, an accelerometer for detecting a shock to the portable device may provide shock related information to the emergency event module.  Emergency event module 301 may automatically analyze the shock related information to
determine whether the shock related information corresponds to an emergency event.  For example, the rate of acceleration experienced by HHS device 10 may indicate the user of the device falling down and/or being thrown.  Upon the automatic detection of
the emergency event, emergency event module 310 may automatically communicate with other modules, including proximity detection module 312 and notification module 318 in a similar manner as would be the case when a user enters a specific sequence of taps
indicating an emergency event.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, HSS device 10 may further include a proximity detection module 312.  Proximity detection module 312 may rely on LTE Direct (also known as 3GPP/3GPP2 ProSe proximity standard) to automatically determine which of the contacts
have mobile devices that are in proximity to HSS device 10, and thus are in a state of proximity.  In one embodiment, a state of proximity may refer to contacts whose cell phone devices are being served by the same cell site as HSS device 10.  A state of
proximity may also refer to whether HSS device 10 and the other user's (identified as contacts in a contact database associated with HSS device 10) devices are within the same city, town, or ZIP code area.  As part of proximity detection, HSS device 10
may automatically perform location measurements to determine its location.  HSS device 10 may automatically perform such measurements alone or in combination with servers in wireless networks 110.  Either a control plane location solution, such as
defined by 3GPP and 3GPP2 or a user plane location such as Secure User Plane Location (SUPL) defined by Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) may be used.  Additional details concerning determining a state of proximity based on a control plane solution or a user
plane solution are described in U.S.  Patent Publication No. 2014/0162687, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.  In particular, FIGS. 7, 9, 14, 15, and 16 and related description provide additional details for determining the state
of proximity.  Other devices that are associated with the user's contacts may also automatically perform location measurements and report the measurements to proximity detection module 312 using wireless networks 110.  A state of proximity may refer to a
current state of proximity or a predicted state of proximity.  The current and/or predicted state of proximity may be determined using the techniques described in U.S.  Patent Publication No. 2014/0162687, which is incorporated by reference herein in its
entirety.  As an example, FIGS. 7-13 of the '687 publication describe various protocols that could be used to assist in determining proximity between two devices.  HSS device 10 may have a set of contacts stored as part of a database that could be
automatically accessed, directly or indirectly, by emergency event module 310.  Once any users with mobile devices listed as contacts are determined to be having a mobile device in a state of proximity, emergency event module 310 may coordinate with
notification module 316 to automatically transmit a message to such mobile devices.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, a user of HSS device 10 may designate contact information to use in case of emergency (ICE).  Several contacts could be designated for use in ICE.  As part of this embodiment, HSS device 10 may first determine whether any
ICE contacts with a mobile device are in a state of proximity.  If not, then the other contacts may be considered.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the message may be a pre-configured message that may be automatically transmitted via SMS, MMS, or similar services.  In an alternative embodiment, prior to transmission, the pre-configured message may be modified to include
additional information based on sensor measurements.  As an example, HSS device 10 may determine its velocity by interacting with a location server (including functionality on the network side in FIG. 4) in wireless networks 110.  The velocity may be
automatically included as part of the pre-configured message.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram showing an exemplary system environment 400 for detecting a state of proximity between two user devices.  In one embodiment, the state of proximity is automatically determined in real-time.  In other words, the
state of proximity is derived dynamically in real-time as and when an emergency event is detected by emergency event module 310.  As an example, this ensures that only those mobile devices are contacted in case of emergency that, at or near the time of
emergency, are in the vicinity of HSS device 10.  Thus, even if a mobile device of a listed contact has the same area code as the use of HSS device 10, that listed contact will not be considered to be in a state of proximity, unless the mobile device is
turned on and is within a certain area proximate to HSS device 10, such as being served by the same cell site as HSS device 10, the same town or city or ZIP code area.  In one embodiment, proximity detection module 312 may automatically determine a state
of proximity between two user devices (e.g., HSS device 10 and other mobile devices) using system environment 400.  In the context of FIG. 4, HSS device 10 may be one of the user elements (UEs), as this term is used in modern cellular networks.  Thus,
for example, HSS device 10 may be UE A 402 and another mobile device may be UE B 404.  User devices UE A 402 and UE B 404 each may have an instance of proximity detection module 312.  Although not shown in FIG. 4, each of these user devices may have the
modules that are shown in FIG. 3.  These user devices may communicate with wireless networks 110 that may include service side functionality 420.  Service side functionality 420 may include multiple modules for supporting the detection of a state of
proximity between UE A 402 and UE B 404.  By way of example, service side functionality 420 may include a ProSe Function A 422, a ProSe Function B 424, a Proximity App Server 426, a SLP A 428, a SLP B 430, a MME 432, a HSS 434, and a S/P-GW 436.  ProSe
Function A 422 may provide the network related actions required for proximity services to UE A 402.  ProSe Function B 424 may provide the network related actions required for proximity services to UE B 404.  Although FIG. 4 shows separate ProSe
functions, their functionality could be combined.  Each of these functions may provide proximity related services, including direct discovery and direct communications in case any of the user devices cannot be served by the cellular network E-UTRAN. 
Proximity App Server 426 may be associated with providing services for emergency event detection and notification.  Proximity App Server 426 may handle application registration requests from user devices that have emergency event detection and
notification modules.  SLP A 428 may be one instance of Secure User Plane Location (SUPL) Location Platform (SLP).  To request location updates for UE A 402, ProSe Function A may contact SLP A 428 and to request location updates for UE B 404, ProSe
Function B may contact SLP B 430.  The UE's location may be reported intermittently to their respective ProSe Functions.  Whenever respective ProSe Functions receive location updates for UE A 402 and UE B 404, they may perform a proximity analysis to
determine a state of proximity of UE A 402 and UE B 404.  Alternatively, ProSe Functions may perform a proximity analysis only when they receive a notification from emergency event module 310 via proximity detection module 312.
<br/><br/> With continued reference to FIG. 4, MME 432, which stands for Mobility Management Entity, may handle control plane management related to UE A 404 and UE B 404.  As an example, MME 432 may provide indication to E-UTRAN that these user devices are
authorized to use the proximity detection service, including the ProSe Functions.  HSS 434, which stands for Home Subscriber Sever, is a database that contains user-related and subscriber-related information.  MME 432 may access HSS 434 to obtain such
information to determine whether the user devices that are requesting emergency event notification and proximity detection are authorized to use such services.  S/P-GW 436, which stands for Serving/PDN gateways, may handle the user plane, including
handover.  While FIG. 4 depicts separate modules and functions, these could be combined or distributed in other manners, as well.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is an exemplary flow chart of methods associated with HSS device 10 of FIG. 1.  In step 502, HSS device 10 may detect a sequence of taps, swipes, and/or gestures.  As described earlier with respect to FIG. 3, the sequence of taps, swipes,
and/or gestures may be detected using modules stored in memory of HSS device 10.
<br/><br/> With continued reference to FIG. 5, in step 504, emergency event module 310 may automatically determine whether a specific sequence of taps, swipes, or gestures indicates an emergency event.  In one embodiment, emergency event module 310 may
automatically receive the sequence of taps from tap recognizer module 302.  In another embodiment, emergency event module 310 may automatically receive the sequence of swipes from swipe recognizer module 304.  In another embodiment, emergency event
module 310 may automatically receive the sequence of gestures from gesture recognizer module 306.  In another embodiment, the specific sequence indicating an emergency event could be a sequence of taps, swipes, and/or gestures.  As an example, a sequence
could be a tap followed by a swipe to the left and then followed by a gesture indicating a move to the right.  In another embodiment, a sequence of hops or jumps could also indicate an emergency event.  As part of this example, smart footwear 140 may be
configured to automatically detect hops or jumps and information regarding such hops and/or jumps may be communicated to emergency event module 310, which in turn may automatically determine whether the sequence of hop and/or jumps corresponds to an
emergency event.  An exemplary sequence of hops and jumps may include two jumps followed by a hop to the left and a hop to the right.  In another embodiment, a sequence could be a combination of taps, swipes, gestures, and/or jumps/hops.  In another
embodiment, wearable electronics device 130 may be a wrist watch that could also be configured to detect a sequence of arm movements.  Thus, for example, a sequence of arm movement indicating arm being moved up, then down, then up, and again down in a
short period of time may indicate an emergency event.  Arm movement could be detected by monitoring arm activity using a band or a watch (another HSS device 10) worn on the user's arm.  As an example, an inertial sensor (an accelerometer and/or a
gyroscope), which might be part of sensors 24, may be part of the arm band or the watch.  An exemplary inertial sensor might be the MPU-9150 sensor sold by InvenSense.  In sum, it might include an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a compass along with
software to detect acceleration along nine axes.  Additional details concerning an arm band are described in U.S.  Patent Publication No. 2014/0240103, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.  In particular, FIGS. 3-6 and related
description provide additional details for an arm band.  In another embodiment, a sequence indicative of an emergency event could be a combination of taps, swipes, gestures, jumps, hops, and/or arm movements.  In another embodiment, as part of step 504,
an indication of an emergency event may come from a health monitoring sensor, such as a sensor for detecting a seizure.  In this embodiment, the user of HSS device 10 need not indicate an emergency event via taps, swipes, gestures, jumps, hops or arm
movements.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, as part of step 504, an indication of an emergency event may be based on other parameters, such as time elapsed since HSS device 10 was last used to place or receive any calls.  In one embodiment emergency event module 310
may work with operating system module 318 and other functionality of HSS device 10 to keep track of time that has elapsed since HSS device 10 was last used to place or receive any calls.  Sensors 24, including GPS may automatically provide the location
of HSS device 10 to emergency event module via sensor module 314.  Additional details concerning determining an amount of time that has elapsed since a mobile device was last used are described in U.S.  Patent Publication No. 2014/0321624, which is
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.  In particular, FIGS. 1-4 and related description provide additional details regarding this functionality.  In this embodiment, the user of HSS device 10 need not indicate an emergency event via taps,
swipes, gestures, jumps, hops or arm movements.
<br/><br/> In step 506, proximity detection module 312 may work in conjunction with the service side functionality discussed in FIG. 4 above to automatically determine whether a mobile device corresponding to a user identified as an emergency contact is in
a state of proximity with HSS device 10.  As an example, when emergency event module 310 automatically determines that the sequence entered by the user of HSS device 10 corresponds to an emergency event, emergency event module 310 may automatically
request proximity detection module 312 to notify the user's contacts that have devices in a state of proximity to the user.  Similarly, when emergency event automatically determines that the input from a health monitoring sensor or sensors qualifies as
an emergency event, emergency event module 310 may automatically request proximity detection module 312 to notify the user's contacts that have devices in a state of proximity to the user.  Upon receiving such a request, proximity detection module 312
may automatically contact via wireless networks 110 ProSe Function, such as ProSe Function A 422.  ProSe Function A 422 may in turn work with Proximity App Server 426, which in turn may work with ProSe Function B 424 and other modules on the service
side, such as SLP A 428, SLP B 430, MME 432, HSS 434, and S/P-GW 436 to determine whether a mobile device corresponding to a user identified as an emergency contact is in a state of proximity with HSS device 10.  As described earlier, the state of
proximity could be an actual state of proximity or a predicted state of proximity.
<br/><br/> Next, in step 508, notification module 316 may automatically transmit a message, indicating the emergency event, to the user of the mobile device determined to be in a state of proximity by proximity detection module 312.  In one embodiment, the
message may be a pre-configured message that may be transmitted via Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), or similar services.  In an alternative embodiment, prior to transmission, the pre-configured message may be
automatically modified to include additional information based on sensor measurements.  As an example, HSS device 10 may determine its velocity by interacting with a location server in wireless networks 110.  The velocity may be included as part of the
pre-configured message.  As an another example, one of the sensors may be an accelerometer for detecting a shock to HSS device 10 and notification module 316 may automatically transmit such information to the user of the mobile device determined to be in
the state of proximity.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, upon determining that a mobile device corresponding to a user identified as an emergency contact is in a state of proximity with HSS device 10, proximity detection module 312, working with service side functionality 420, may
allow automatic direct discovery of one user device, such as UE B 404 by another user device, such as UE A 402.  In addition, proximity detection module 312, working with service side functionality 420, may allow even direct communication between the UE
A 402 and UE B 404.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, reserve battery 28 may be charged via kinetic energy.  In one embodiment, battery 26 may supply power to the entire HSS device 10; but, reserve battery 28 may supply power to only those modules that are needed for performing
steps 502, 504, 506, and 508 and any associated components of HSS device 10.  In one embodiment, reserve battery 28 may continue to supply power to these modules, even if HSS device 10 is turned off by the user.  In one embodiment, even when HSS device
10 is turned off, reserve battery 28 may supply power to only: (1) emergency event module 310, and (2) one or more of tap recognizer module 302, swipe recognizer module 304, or gesture recognizer module 306.  The choice of modules may be based on the
nature of the sequence entered by the user that corresponds to an emergency event.  Once emergency event module 310 determines an emergency event, then reserve battery 28 may supply power to other modules, including proximity detection module 312, sensor
module 314, notification module 316, and operating system module 318.
<br/><br/> It is to be understood that the modules and components depicted herein are merely exemplary.  In an abstract, but still definite sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively "associated" such that the
desired functionality is achieved.  Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as "associated with" each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial
components.  Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being "operably connected," or "operably coupled," to each other to achieve the desired functionality.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, those skilled in the art will recognize that boundaries between the functionality of the above described operations merely illustrative.  The functionality of multiple operations may be combined into a single operation, and/or the
functionality of a single operation may be distributed in additional operations.  Moreover, alternative embodiments may include multiple instances of a particular operation, and the order of operations may be altered in various other embodiments.
<br/><br/> Although the invention is described herein with reference to specific embodiments, various modifications and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention as set forth in the claims below.  Accordingly, the
specification and figures are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense, and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.  Any benefits, advantages, or solutions to problems that
are described herein with regard to specific embodiments are not intended to be construed as a critical, required, or essential feature or element of any or all the claims.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the terms "a" or "an," as used herein, are defined as one or more than one.  Also, the use of introductory phrases such as "at least one" and "one or more" in the claims should not be construed to imply that the introduction of
another claim element by the indefinite articles "a" or "an" limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim element to inventions containing only one such element, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or
"at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "an." The same holds true for the use of definite articles.
<br/><br/> Unless stated otherwise, terms such as "first" and "second" are used to arbitrarily distinguish between the elements such terms describe.  Thus, these terms are not necessarily intended to indicate temporal or other prioritization of such
elements.
