<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 1, wherein determining if the token should be sent to the mobile computing device comprises stopping the token from being sent if one or more previous tokens were sent after receiving the instruction to put the IM
client-side application into the IM hibernation mode.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 1, wherein the instruction is generated in response to the IM user being inactive with respect to the IM client-side application for a pre-determined period of time.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: by the IM server, receiving a reconnection request from the IM client-side application;  and by the IM server, re-establishing the communication-protocol session between the IM client-side
application and the IM server.
<br/><br/> 9.  The method of claim 1, wherein the IM server and the server computing device are the same device.
<br/><br/> 10.  The method of claim 1, wherein the IM server and the server computing device are different devices.
<br/><br/> 11.  A server computing device comprising: one or more processors;  and one or more computer-readable non-transitory storage media embodying software to run an IM server that is configured when executed by one or more of the processors to:
receive an instruction to put an instant messaging (IM) client-side application of an IM user into an IM hibernation mode, wherein the IM client-side application is installed on a mobile computing device of the user, wherein the IM user has an active IM
status on the IM server, and wherein a communication-protocol session has been established between the IM server and the IM client-side application;  in response to the instruction, terminate the communication-protocol session to put the IM client-side
application into the IM hibernation mode, wherein the mobile computing device remains active, and wherein the IM server maintains an active IM status for the IM user;  while the IM client-side application is in the IM hibernation mode: receive an instant
message for the IM user;  generate, for the instant message, a token comprising a pointer to the instant message within a stream of instant messages maintained by the IM server for the IM user;  send, to the mobile computing device, a push notification
comprising the token when the instant message is received by the IM server, the push notification being sent without re-establishing the communication-protocol session with the IM server;  and when a timeout period associated with the IM hibernation mode
is exceeded, terminate the active IM status of the IM user on the IM server.
<br/><br/> 12.  The server computing device of claim 11, wherein causing the push notification to be sent to the mobile computing device when the instant message for the IM user is received by the IM server while the IM client-side application is in IM
hibernation mode comprises: causing a push notification comprising the token to be sent to the mobile computing device;  and storing the instant message in storage associated with the IM server.
<br/><br/> 13.  The server computing device of claim 12, wherein the software is further configured when executed to: receive from the IM client-side application reconnection request comprising the token;  re-establish the communication-protocol session
between the IM client-side application and the IM server;  and cause the instant message corresponding to the token to be sent to the IM client-side application.
<br/><br/> 14.  The server computing device of claim 12, wherein the push notification comprises all or part of the received instant message for the IM user.
<br/><br/> 15.  The server computing device of claim 11, wherein the communication-protocol session comprises a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) session.
<br/><br/> 16.  The server computing device of claim 11, wherein determining if the token should be sent to the mobile computing device comprises stopping the token from being sent if one or more previous tokens were sent after receiving the instruction to
put the IM client-side application into the IM hibernation mode.
<br/><br/> 17.  The server computing device of claim 11, wherein the instruction is generated in response to the IM user being inactive with respect to the IM client-side application for a pre-determined period of time.
<br/><br/> 18.  The server computing device of claim 11, wherein the software is further configured when executed to: receive a reconnection request from the IM client-side application;  and re-establish the communication-protocol session between the IM
client-side application and the IM server.
<br/><br/> 19.  One or more computer-readable non-transitory storage media embodying software to run an IM server that is configured when executed to: receive an instruction to put an instant messaging (IM) client-side application of an IM user into an IM
hibernation mode, wherein the IM client-side application is installed on a mobile computing device of the user, wherein the IM user has an active IM status on the IM server, and wherein a communication-protocol session has been established between the IM

<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Instant messaging on mobile devices is nearly ubiquitous.  Users often install multiple clients such as AOL instant messenger, Yahoo! messenger, Google gchat, MSN messenger, Kik messenger, BlackBerry messenger, etc. on their mobile devices to
remain in constant connection with their friends, family, and co-workers.  However, maintaining the data connection from a mobile device to an instant messaging server requires a constant data connection, which is expensive both from a traffic and
battery life standpoint.  Therefore, users may wish to power down their device to save battery life while still maintaining a presence on the IM server so that they may continue to receive messages. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENT(S)
<br/><br/>Overview
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments relate to an instant messaging service that provides users with the ability to set a "hibernate" mode, wherein the user powers down his or her mobile device, or at a very minimum, tears down the battery-draining connection
to the instant messaging (IM) server, while still maintaining an "available" presence to the IM system and receiving messaging through an alternate protocol, such a push notification.  The method allows a mobile device to select between message delivery
optimized for high traffic and message delivery optimized for low traffic based on user activity.
<br/><br/> Implementations of the present invention extend these concepts by allowing the IM server to store messages to be delivered to the user when he or she exits hibernate mode, or to deliver the instant messages to the user through the form of a push
notification or short message system (SMS) message.  In particular embodiments, the first message received destined for the user after the user enters hibernate mode is encoded with a token, that serves as a pointer to the message history.  After the
user exits hibernate mode, the message server retrieves all messages received after the message identified in the token and delivers the consolidated message stream to a user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example instant messaging (IM) system 100.  IM server 107 is connected via public IP network (the Internet) 101.  IM server 107 includes web tier 108, Jabber server 109, and channel server 110.  Web tier 108 includes
business logic, such as privacy and permissions, for allowing clients to access IM server 107 or be contacted by other users.  Web tier also maintains a client timeout timer; the timer is reset every time mobile device 104 pings web tier 108.  If the
timer expires without receiving a ping from mobile device 104, the client associated with mobile device 104 is disconnected.  In particular embodiments, this ping is sent every 60 minutes.  Jabber server 109 is responsible for communicating Extensible
Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) messages to and from the clients, and to translate jabber protocol messages to proprietary IM service protocols.  Jabber server 109 also stores messages for offline clients for later delivery.  Channel server 110
acts as the master server and maintains presence information for the various clients of IM system 100 to inform other users who is available for message delivery.  In particular embodiments, IM server 107 can be a single server housing one or more of web
tier 108, Jabber server 109, and channel server 110.  In particular embodiments, IM server 107 is a logical construct, and one or more of web tier 108, Jabber server 109, and channel server 110 are separate and independent servers connected through IP
networks.
<br/><br/> IM client 1 (with identifier "&lt;1''&gt;") connects to IM server 107 using a standard personal computer (PC) 105 through public internet protocol (IP) network 101, establishing a transmission control protocol (TCP) session (although XMPP is the
preferred protocol for exchanging instant messages, the transport protocol, in one implementation, is still TCP) with the IM server 107.  Other logical or transport layer connection protocols can also be used.  This connection is shown by line 111 (it is
understood that line 111 should be shown through public IP network 101 but for the sake of clarity it is drawn outside of public IP network 101.) IM server 107 updates an entry in its presence information data structure 106 residing in channel server
110, showing a "&lt;1&gt;" in the data structure to identify that client 105 is available to receive instant messages.
<br/><br/> Mobile client 2, identified by the label "&lt;2&gt;" connects using wireless mobile device 104.  Mobile device 104 connects to IM server 107 through a physical wireless medium to a cellular tower 103 connected to a wireless service provider's
data network 102, then through the public IP network.  Much like client 1, mobile client 2 establishes a TCP session 112 with the IM server 107.  The IM server records the client 104's presence information in the channel server 110, indicated by the
entry "&lt;2&gt;" in the presence information data structure 106.
<br/><br/> Unlike client 1, mobile client 2 is battery powered, and must maintain TCP session 112 through a wireless radio frequency (rf) medium.  This makes keeping the TCP connection open an expensive affair, as the mobile device 104 must constantly send
or respond to keepalive messages from the IM server 107.  Furthermore, mobile device 104 may roam across multiple cellular areas.  Wireless service provider data network 102 must keep track of the mobility of mobile device 104, and facilitate handoffs to
various cellular towers 103, and possibly, various service nodes (not shown).  It is possible that, given enough movement, wireless service provider data network 102 will be unable to continue routing packets to or from mobile device 104, and the TCP
connection will be torn down.  This results in client 2's presence on the IM server to appear and disappear synchronously with the TCP connection.
<br/><br/> More importantly, every time mobile device 104 reestablishes a data connection, it will renegotiate a new TCP session with IM server 107.  TCP session initialization and maintenance is expensive from both a bandwidth and battery consumption
perspective.  Thus it is desirable to allow mobile devices to "hibernate" while maintaining a presence on IM server 107 to receive messages, and only re-initiate a TCP connection when the user is ready to begin using the IM service.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an example method for entering a hibernate mode.  Actions by mobile client 2 are shown in the top half of the flowchart (client 201) above the dotted line.  Actions performed by the server 107 are shown in the bottom half of
the flowchart (server 202) below the dotted line.  The process begins at S, when a user stops using an IM client on his mobile device.  The user may initiate the hibernate mode by sending an explicit user command in step 204.  Upon receiving the
hibernate command, the mobile IM client proceeds to step 205.  In particular embodiments, IM client maintains an inactivity timer that measures the amount of time a user has gone without typing a message, sending a message, or otherwise using the client. When the inactivity timer exceeds a predetermined threshold, as in step 203, the IM client proceeds to step 205.  In step 205, the IM client transmits the hibernate request to Jabber server 109.
<br/><br/> At step 208, Jabber server 109 receives the hibernate request, and at step 209, Jabber server 109 adds identifier information, such as a session identifier (SID) or other information to identify the particular mobile client session.  In
particular embodiments, mobile device 104 may have multiple chat clients connected to Jabber server 109, and wishes to hibernate one or all of its clients.  Thus, Jabber server 109 may append SIDs, client IDs, or some device ID linked to all clients
associated with a particular device.  Jabber server 109 then forwards the hibernate request to channel server 110.  In particular embodiments, the hibernate request may bypass the Jabber server, and mobile device 104 may send hibernate request to channel
server 110 directly.  In particular embodiments, mobile device 104 may append SIDs or other identifiers to the hibernate request.
<br/><br/> At Step 211, channel server 110 records the client 2 as hibernated, but does not alter the presence information displayed to other users.  In particular embodiments, channel server 110 may modify client 2's presence to indicate hibernating or
"idle" to other users.  Channel server 110 maintains the session associated with the SID in the request alive.  In particular embodiments, channel server 110 maintains the connection with Jabber server 109 alive as well.
<br/><br/> In step 210, after channel server 110 marks client 2 down as hibernated, channel server 110 sends an acknowledgement to mobile device 104.  In particular embodiments, Jabber server 109 sends the acknowledgement (ACK).
<br/><br/> In step 206, mobile device 104 awaits acknowledgement.  In particular embodiments, if mobile device 104 waits longer than a predetermined time period without receiving an ACK, it retransmits the hibernate request.
<br/><br/> In step 207, after receiving the ACK, mobile device 104 disconnects, and Jabber server 109 tears down the TCP connection.  In particular embodiments, channel server 110 keeps the connection between Jabber server 109 and channel server 110 for
client 2 alive.  In particular embodiments, mobile device 104 maintains the hibernate mode through pinging web tier 108 every 60 minutes.  So long as mobile device 104 has power and a data connection once every 60 minutes, the hibernate mode will be
maintained in perpetuity.  However, if the predetermined timeout period is exceeded, for example, if 70 minutes elapse without a ping from mobile device, the hibernate mode is dropped and user's presence removed from the channel server.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates a method of delivering a message to a hibernating client.  In step 301, Jabber server 109 receives a message addressed to client 2.  In step 302, Jabber server 109 checks to see whether client 2 is active.  Jabber server 109
performs this check by requesting the presence information in presence information data structure 106 from channel server 110.  If the user is active, the message is delivered as normal in step 303.  If the user is not active, in step 304, Jabber server
109 reads the data structure associated with client 2 in order to determine whether client 2 is hibernating.  If client 2 is not hibernating, then in step 305 Jabber server 109 stores the received message for later delivery.  If client 2 is marked as
hibernating, in 306 Jabber server generates a token for transmission to client 2.  In particular embodiments, channel server 110 generates the token.
<br/><br/> The token generated by Jabber server 109 acts as a pointer to the received message.  Client 2 may receive multiple messages after the first received message after hibernating.  The token identifies the first message in a stream of message a user
received after hibernating his or her device.  In particular embodiments, a token is generated for every message received after client 2 hibernates.  In particular embodiments, a token is generated only for the first message received after client 2
hibernates.
<br/><br/> In step 307, Jabber server 109 transmits a push notification to mobile device 104.  Push notifications may be generated by interacting with an application program interface (API) for the operating system of mobile device 104, such as through the
Google Android push notification API.  In particular embodiments, push notifications use short message service (SMS) channels, so that users may receive push notifications even when not receiving a data connection.  In other embodiments, push
notifications may use Microsoft (MS) direct push through use of a TCP tunnel.  In particular embodiments, the push notification is generated by an application utilizing the Java Mobile Push API.  This disclosure contemplates multiple types and mechanisms
of push notification that may be envisioned by one of ordinary skill in the art.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, part or all of the message is included in the push notification along with the token.  In other embodiments, only the sender's chat handle is included in the push notification.  In particular embodiments, every single
message received after client 2 hibernates is pushed to mobile device 104.  In particular embodiments, only the first message received after client 2 hibernates is pushed to mobile device 104.
<br/><br/> At step 308, the mobile device 104 receives the push notification.  At step 309, user of mobile device 104 is prompted with a choice as to whether to reconnect to the service.  If the user of mobile device 104 chooses not to reconnect to the IM
service, in step 310, client 2 remains in hibernation mode.  If the user of mobile device 104 chooses to reconnect to the IM service, in step 311 mobile device 104 re-establishes a TCP connection to Jabber server 109, and transmits the received token
back to the Jabber server.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates an example reconnection after client 2 has entered hibernate mode.  At step 401, Jabber server 109 reestablishes a TCP connection with mobile device 104.  At step 402, Jabber server 109 waits for the transmission of the token. If no token is received, Jabber server 109 communicates at step 503 with channel server 110 to deassert the hibernate designation, and client 2 is treated as a normal active client.
<br/><br/> If, at step 402, Jabber server 109 receives a token, the process flows to step 404.  At step 404, Jabber server accesses a store of messages addressed to client 2, and retrieves the message associated with the token, along with all subsequently
received messages.  At step 405, Jabber server 109 delivers these messages to mobile device 104 over its TCP connection 112.
<br/><br/> After the messages are delivered, at step 403 Jabber server 109 communicates with channel server 110 to de-assert the hibernate marker for client 2, and client 2 is treated like any other active client.

Mac-based, or Unix or Linux-based, or Symbian-based, among other suitable operating systems.  The operating system, other computer code (including control client 708 described below) and/or data may be physically stored within a memory block 706 that is
operatively coupled to controller 704.
<br/><br/> Memory block 706 encompasses one or more storage media and generally provides a place to store computer code (e.g., software and/or firmware) and data that are used by the computing platform 702.  By way of example, memory block 706 may include
various tangible computer-readable storage media including Read-Only Memory (ROM) and/or Random-Access Memory (RAM).  As is well known in the art, ROM acts to transfer data and instructions uni-directionally to controller 704, and RAM is used typically
to transfer data and instructions in a bi-directional manner.  Memory block 706 may also include one or more fixed storage devices in the form of, by way of example, solid-state hard disk drives (HDDs), among other suitable forms of memory coupled
bi-directionally to controller 704.  Information may also reside on a removable storage medium loaded into or installed in multipoint sensing devices when needed.  By way of example, any of a number of suitable memory cards may be loaded into computing
platform 702 on a temporary or permanent basis.
<br/><br/> Controller 704 is also generally coupled to a variety of interfaces such as graphics control, video interface, input interface, output interface, and storage interface, and network interface, and these interfaces in turn are coupled to the
appropriate devices.  In certain embodiment, Controller 704 may connected to an input structure 714 and display 716 may be provided together, such an in the case of a touchscreen where a touch sensitive mechanism is provided in conjunction with the
display 716.  In such embodiments, the user may select or interact with displayed interface elements via the touch sensitive mechanism.  In this way, the displayed interface may provide interactive functionality, allowing a user to navigate the displayed
interface by touching the display 716.
<br/><br/> Electric signals (e.g., analog) may be produced by microphone 710 and fed to earpiece 712.  Controller 704 may receive instruction signals from input structure 714 and control the operation of display 716.  By way of example, display 716 may
incorporate liquid crystal display (LCD), light emitting diode (LED), Interferometric modulator display (IMOD), or any other suitable display technology.  Audio signals may be transmitted and received by means of an antenna 718 that may be connected
through a radio interface 720 or audio input interface such as microphone 724 to codec 722 configured to process signals under control of controller 704.  Additionally, multipoint sensing devices may be powered power source 732.
<br/><br/> Mobile device may also include one or more user input devices 734 (other than input structure 714) that are operatively coupled to the controller 704.  Generally, input devices 734 are configured to transfer data, commands and responses from the
outside world into multipoint sensing devices.  By way of example, mobile device may include a keyboard or mouse.  Input devices 734 may also include one or more hard buttons.
<br/><br/> Display device 716 is generally configured to display a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides an easy to use visual interface between a user of the computing platform 702 and the operating system or application(s) running on the mobile
device.  Generally, the GUI presents programs, files and operational options with graphical images.  During operation, the user may select and activate various graphical images displayed on the display 716 in order to initiate functions and tasks
associated therewith.
<br/><br/> Herein, reference to a computer-readable storage medium encompasses one or more non-transitory, tangible computer-readable storage media possessing structure.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a computer-readable storage medium may
include a semiconductor-based or other integrated circuit (IC) (such, as for example, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific IC (ASIC)), a hard disk, an HDD, a hybrid hard drive (HHD), an optical disc, an optical disc drive
(ODD), a magneto-optical disc, a magneto-optical drive, a floppy disk, a floppy disk drive (FDD), magnetic tape, a holographic storage medium, a solid-state drive (SSD), a RAM-drive, a SECURE DIGITAL card, a SECURE DIGITAL drive, or another suitable
computer-readable storage medium or a combination of two or more of these, where appropriate.  Herein, reference to a computer-readable storage medium excludes any medium that is not eligible for patent protection under 35 U.S.C.  .sctn.101.  Herein,
reference to a computer-readable storage medium excludes transitory forms of signal transmission (such as a propagating electrical or electromagnetic signal per se) to the extent that they are not eligible for patent protection under 35 U.S.C. 
.sctn.101.
<br/><br/> This disclosure contemplates one or more computer-readable storage media implementing any suitable storage.  In particular embodiments, a computer-readable storage medium implements one or more portions of processor 602 (such as, for example,
one or more internal registers or caches), one or more portions of memory 604, one or more portions of storage 606, or a combination of these, where appropriate.  In particular embodiments, a computer-readable storage medium implements RAM or ROM.  In
particular embodiments, a computer-readable storage medium implements volatile or persistent memory.  In particular embodiments, one or more computer-readable storage media embody software.  Herein, reference to software may encompass one or more
applications, bytecode, one or more computer programs, one or more executables, one or more instructions, logic, machine code, one or more scripts, or source code, and vice versa, where appropriate.  In particular embodiments, software includes one or
more application programming interfaces (APIs).  This disclosure contemplates any suitable software written or otherwise expressed in any suitable programming language or combination of programming languages.  In particular embodiments, software is
expressed as source code or object code.  In particular embodiments, software is expressed in a higher-level programming language, such as, for example, C, Perl, or a suitable extension thereof.  In particular embodiments, software is expressed in a
lower-level programming language, such as assembly language (or machine code).  In particular embodiments, software is expressed in JAVA.  In particular embodiments, software is expressed in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Markup Language
(XML), or other suitable markup language.
