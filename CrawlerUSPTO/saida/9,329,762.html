       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> Methods and systems of reversing edit operations of a media-rich project
     are disclosed. In one embodiment, the method comprises, offering to a
     user an editing action on a pre-edited view of a media-rich project, in
     which the editing action after being performed on the pre-edited view
     displays a first-edited view of the project; saving, in response to the
     user switching to a second view, the first-edited view as a last-edited
     view; and reversing, in response to a user reverse action, the editing
     action of the last-edited view by initiating a reverse function, in which
     the reverse function comprises two steps, in which a first step causes
     the editor to exit from the second view and to land on the last-edited
     view, and a second step causes the last-edited view to revert to the
     pre-edited view.

<br/><br/>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the present invention broadly relate to systems and methods for editing media-based projects.  More particularly, embodiments of the present invention relate to editing of content (multimedia files, photos, text, stylistic
parameters, and so on) in creating a media-based project via an electronic application of a user device.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The statements in this section may serve as a background to help understand the invention, but may not constitute prior art.
<br/><br/> In the field of media-based project creation, there are many applications that assist users in creating media-based projects.  Examples include applications to make photobooks, applications to design manufacturing parts, three-dimensional
computer aided design software (such as AutoCAD), and a whole variety of other software applications and packages that have multiple pages, views, or complex navigation patterns during editing.
<br/><br/> A common drawback with conventional media-based project creation software is the difficulty in intuitively seeing what operation will be undone or reversed when a user, who might have manipulated multiple views and navigated in multiple
locations in the software, decides to undo an operation.  Users must often repetitively undo and re-do an operation in order to see clearly what is being undone or reversed, wasting time and frustrating the users in the process.
<br/><br/> It would be an advancement in the art of such media-based project creation to be able to easily, quickly, and clearly see what is being undone or reversed when a user performs an undo operation.
<br/><br/> Therefore, there is a long-felt and unsolved need to make it easy and efficient for a user to undo or reverse editing operations in a complex media-based project.
<br/><br/> It is against this background that various embodiments of the present invention were developed.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the present invention is method of reversing edit operations of a media-rich project, the method offered by a user device in a client-server environment, the method comprising, offering to a user an editing action on a
pre-edited view of said media-rich project via an input device, wherein said editing action after being performed on said pre-edited view displays a first-edited view of said project; saving, in response to said user switching to a second view, said
first-edited view as a last-edited view; and reversing, in response to a user reverse action, said editing action of said last-edited view by initiating a reverse function, wherein said reverse function comprises two steps, wherein a first user reverse
action step causes said editor to exit from said second view and to land on said last-edited view, and a second user reverse action step causes said last-edited view to revert to said pre-edited view, wherein said pre-edited view is a view of said
project before said editing action was performed on said first-edited view.
<br/><br/> In one aspect, said each view comprises a spread.  In another aspect, said each view comprises a view in a three dimensional (3D) editing interface.  In another aspect, said media-rich project is a photo-project.  In another aspect, said
photo-project is a photobook.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the method further comprises, confirming by said user at said second view to exit from said second view before landing on said last-edited view, wherein said step of confirming adds a third step to said user reverse action.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the method further comprises, creating a manifested preview of said photobook, wherein said manifested preview is a three-dimensional virtual production of a printable photobook graphically showing a front cover, a back
cover, a spine, and said spread, wherein said front cover, said back cover, and said spread are virtually turnable via the input device.
<br/><br/> In one aspect, said spread comprise automatic grouping of a plurality of photos, wherein said grouping is based on at least one aspect of image heuristics, wherein said at least one aspect of image heuristics comprises a use case.  In another
aspect, an uploaded photo, by image analysis, is analyzed to determine appropriateness and to extract image metadata.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the method further comprises, displaying an indicator, before said first user reverse action, wherein said indicator indicates that said first user reverse action will change views from said second view back to said
last-edited view.
<br/><br/> In another aspect, the present invention is a non-transitory, computer-readable, physical storage medium storing executable instructions, which when executed by a hardware processor, causes the processor to perform a process of creating a media
rich project or product by reversing edit operations in a client-server environment, the instructions causing the processor to perform the steps of reversing editing operations as taught in the preceding paragraphs.
<br/><br/> In another aspect, the present invention is a system for creating a media rich project by reversing edit operations, the system comprising a user device having a processor, a display, and a first memory; a server comprising a second memory and a
data repository; a telecommunications-link between said user device and said server; and a plurality of computer codes embodied on said memory of said user-device, said plurality of computer codes which when executed causes said processor to execute a
process comprising the aforementioned steps.  Other aspects of the present invention will be described in the detailed description. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

shipped physically, or delivered electronically to the one or more users.  Examples include applications to make photobooks, applications to design manufacturing parts, three-dimensional computer aided design software (such as AutoCAD), and a whole
variety of other software applications and packages that have multiple pages, views, or complex navigation patterns during editing, and that include complex media-rich data.  "View" is a current display or location of a user in a complex media-based
project, in which the user might navigate through multiple views of the project.  Examples of views include pages, spreads, and so on, in a photobook editing application; different angles being viewed of a manufacturing part in 3D computer-aided design
software; or any other application or software package in which multiple displays of a project might be navigated by a user during editing.  "Reverse" or "undo" is an operation performed on a media-based project to revert to a previous state of an edited
project, after it has been edited by the user.  The reverse or undo operation typically reverses the last operation performed by the user, but in some embodiment, operations may also be grouped intelligently and undone as a group.  "Grid preview" is a
framework of virtual spaced bars (rectangular or square) that are parallel or across each other.  In a grid preview of a photo-project, all pages or spreads of the photo-project are displayed along a virtual grid on a display screen, wherein all pages or
spreads are in miniature forms in a single display, and such miniature forms are individually editable via input devices.  "Space constrained device" is a device that has limited space or limited means to offer user inputs into such devices.  Limited
space or limited means include, such as, a miniature soft on-screen keyboard, a touch screen of a smart phone, a stylus of a touch screen device, and the like.  "Virtual manifestation" refers to a virtually displayed but appearing on screen like a real
photobook that will eventually be produced by printing and binding, after an order to print is received.  "Communications network" is a collection of terminal nodes, links and any intermediate nodes that are connected so as to enable telecommunication
between the terminals.  The Internet is a widely used communications network.  "Physical medium" and "storage medium" refer to an article of manufacture in which computer program code may be stored, said program code later to be executed by a computer
having at least one processor, such as a server.  "Data repository" refers to a central place, such as a database, where data is stored and maintained.  It is also a logical (and sometimes physical) partitioning of data where multiple databases which
apply to specific applications or sets of applications reside.  "Interface", "user interface", or "graphical user interface (GUI)" is a user interface (UI) in a display of a computer screen, where a user of a computer system can provide input.  A touch
interface is an interface where a user can provide an input by using a finger or stylus.  "Server" is a computer comprising a processor and a memory that is used by the system to provide the software program code implementing the invention to multiple
client devices over a communications network.  "User-device", "client device", "mobile device," "computing device", or "user-operated computer" is a computer with a display, input options, a processor and a memory, often in the form of a laptop, desktop,
tablet, smartphone, or the like, that is used by users of the system to access the services of the present invention.  "Client-server connection", "telecommunications link", or "client-server environment" is a connection between a sever and a user-device
via a communications network.  "Image", "photo," and "photograph" shall be used interchangeably to refer to a digital image stored in memory.  "Multimedia content" and "content" refers to images and/or text, as well as other content in a project. 
"Visual content", "visual information", and "image information" is 2-D information presented in images after it has been processed and analyzed through computer algorithms.  "Automatic image information" is visual information in the images extracted by
the system using automated photo analysis carried out by a processor.  "Observed image information" is visual information in the images extracted by the system through observing user interactions at the GUI.  "Media analysis," "photo analysis," and
"image analysis" are all computer-based methods of extracting visual information from media files.  These terms are used interchangeably to refer to an automated software and/or hardware process by which important features or salient features of the
media files are identified, separated from background, extracted, and analyzed.  Photo analysis in particular extracts useful information from digital images by means of digital image processing.  In some embodiments, photo analysis comprises "feature
extraction," in which specific features are extracted.  Examples of features include, but are not limited to, scenery, faces, wedding cakes, people present, etc. "Computer vision" is a field that includes methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and
understanding images and high-dimensional data in order to produce numerical or symbolic visual information.  "Metadata" or "meta-data" is a set of data that describes and gives information about images.  Meta-data also comprises data embedded in a
digital image, which is known as EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) data.  "Automatic customization actions" refer to any automatic editorial work performed automatically by the system to customize a design of a photo project.  Examples of
customization actions include, but is not limited to, matching images automatically to a use case specific theme, grouping similar images, grouping images having identical faces, grouping images having identical objects, removing undesirable images,
cropping images to highlight relevant portions of said images, applying correction function on the plurality of images, and so on.  "Printed project" and "printed product" refer to a project that is physically printed on a paper by a printing machine. 
Examples of printed products include, but not limited to, a photobook, a photocalendar, a photocard, and the like.  "Use case" refers to a use, context, or events related to a use of the printed project.  Use cases may comprise a wedding, a night out, an
event with friends, a baby, a year in review, a trip, a water-related event, a beach trip, a lake trip, a pool trip, a snow-related event, a ski trip, a road trip, and the like.  A use case is any scenario in which the user will be ultimately providing
images from.  "User analysis" comprises behavioral observation of the user's inputs, interests, and choices, and any data relevant to the interest of the user.  Such data can be obtained by the user's own inputs or by third party applications comprising
social networking sites.  User analysis is performed on the expected user of the printed product.  User analysis can be manual inputs as well as automatic extractions.  "User data" refers to data obtained through user analysis.  The user's interactions
with the system and/or behavioral observations of the user by the system via user inputs create such user data.  "Social media platform" refers to social or professional networking sites.  Such sites include, but are not limited to, <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> TWITTER,
LINKEDIN, and the like.  "Canvas" is a virtual page of a project as displayed on a GUI, before being printed into a printed product.  A canvas has a particular design for a page or pages of a project, which is selected by selecting a design from a
designset (and automatically inheriting a layout from a layoutset, since every designset is tied to a layoutset).  The canvas includes the design along with the content inserted by the user into the design.  "Layout" specifies a number of photo and/or
text slots and their positions on a canvas.  No style is applied on a layout.  "Layoutset" is a collection or set of layouts.  Layouts are distinguished by their types.  The types comprise magazine layouts, signature layouts, and the like.  "Style",
"styling", or "style and formatting information" adds design customizations over a layout, in which the customizations comprise frames, stickers, backgrounds, borders, and their appearances and positions, including fonts, colors, etc. "Design" is a
particular style on top of a layout.  "Designset" is a collection or set of designs.  Designs are grouped by the layoutsets being used.  One layoutset can spur off many designsets.  A design from a given designset can choose its layout from the
associated layoutset that is also related to that designset.  That is known as a "design-layout relationship." "Theme" is a collection or set of designsets.  "Spread" is a canvas that extends to two opposite pages of an album or book.  Two opposing pages
can have one photo stretching to two pages, or a plurality of photos arranged across the two pages, based on a design choice made by a user.  The outer cover of a book may have an additional part, called spine, which bridges a front cover and a back
cover.  Therefore, a spread on the outer cover of the book may stretch to three elements, including the front cover, the spine, and the back cover.  In some other parts of the specification, the word "spread" may also be used to mean simply "extend to"
or "distribute across." The usage of the word "spread" that is intended will be clearly evident from the context of the use of the word "spread" within the context of the paragraph or sentence in which it is being used.  "Page" in the context of a
photobook refers to a page on which a user designs a photo page for a photobook creation.  In a book, when two opposing pages flip open, in the same manner of a butterfly opening up wings, the two opposing pages may be called a "spread", as defined
above.  In a two page design, in the form of a butterfly-like inside-wings, one photo can stretch to two opposing pages.  Alternatively, in one spread, each page may comprise a plurality of photos.  An inside page of a book may be different from an
outside page, or cover, of the same book.  An outside page, or cover, may often be harder, being a hard cover.  An outside page may include (1) a front cover, (2) a back cover, and (3) a spine, between the front cover and the back cover.  Hence, a full
outside cover or outside spread of a photobook may have these three elements, which contrasts with an inside spread that consists of just two opposing pages.  "Photo slot" is a slot or location on a page of a canvas in which a target image or photo can
be placed.  "Text slot" or "caption slot" is a slot or location on a page of a virtual canvas in which text or a caption can be inserted.  "Aesthetics" is a visual appearance of a design, designating the look and feel of the design.  "Saliency" refers to
a most relevant and/or most important part of an image as determined by image analysis or user action analysis (user inputs).  "Face detection" is a specific type of image analysis that determines locations and sizes of human faces in images.  The
algorithms used detect faces from background (buildings, trees, bodies, and the like).  "Object detection" is a specific type of image analysis that detects instances of semantic objects of a certain class in digital images and videos.  "Timestamp" is a
sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually providing date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second.  "Image heuristics" refers to specific types of image analysis that are
based on experience-based techniques for image analysis that give a solution that is not guaranteed to be optimal.  Certain image issues for creating an optimal design are resolved in certain ways as defined in the specification.  Such issues primarily
are relevant in image processing and image editing, to finally produce a design.  Since such solutions are not guaranteed to be optimal global solutions, they may be referred to as image heuristics in some embodiments.  "Image sequence" is a sequence of
images in which the sequence is determined by timestamp, geo-location, landscape, or by some other ordering.  "Image score" is a relative importance of an image calculated mathematically to determine a best fitting image for an intended use.  "Rule"
refers to any instruction provided by the methods and the systems of the present invention in the process of creating a project.  A rule comprises image heuristics, computer programs or codes, and/or algorithms.  "Algorithm" is a set of instructions to
be followed in calculations or image processing, especially by a computer.  In a computer implemented method or system, the term algorithm may be used interchangeably with the terms "rules" or "instructions," to refer to a sequence of steps to be carried
out by a computer processor following instructions encoded in memory.  "Buffer area" is an area around an object of interest in the photo.  For example, if one takes a photo of an apple on a table, one wouldn't want the photo window to crop the apple
exactly at the edge of the apple.  One would want there to be "buffer area" around the apple so that it doesn't look crowded on the page.  The size of the buffer area is an aesthetic choice of the user or designer.  "Focal box", "focal area," or "focal
subsection" is defined on a layout or a design, and defines an area within a photo slot that is "visible" or "unobstructed." In other words, this is the area on the design where the photo can clearly be seen.  If a photo slot were completely uncovered,
then this focal box would simply be the dimension of the photo slot itself.  The focal box can be represented with any shape, not just a rectangle, as long as it's a continuous shape.  That is, a focal box is a box of any shape that is contained within
the bounds of a photo slot, which a photo is fitted to.  Most of the time, the focal box and the bounds of the photo slot are the same.  However, when there is something covering parts of the photo slot (for example, a caption covering up a portion of a
photo slot, a border, or any other obstruction to the photo slot), then the focal box is adjusted to be less than the actual photo slot, so that any inserted photo is automatically shifted away from the area that is covered.  "One embodiment" or "an
embodiment" means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention.  The appearance of the phrases "in one embodiment" in various places in the
specification is not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, nor is a separate or alternative embodiment mutually exclusive of other embodiments.  Various features are described which may be exhibited by some embodiments and not others.

<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the present invention is a method of reversing edit operations of a media-rich project, the method offered by a user device in a client-server environment, the method comprising, offering to a user an editing action on a
pre-edited view of said media-rich project via an input device, wherein said editing action after being performed on said pre-edited view displays a first-edited view of said project; saving, in response to said user switching to a second view, said
first-edited view as a last-edited view; and reversing, in response to a user reverse action, said editing action of said last-edited view by initiating a reverse function, wherein said reverse function comprises two steps, wherein a first user reverse
action step causes said editor to exit from said second view and to land on said last-edited view, and a second user reverse action step causes said last-edited view to revert to said pre-edited view, wherein said pre-edited view is a view of said
project before said editing action was performed on said first-edited view.
<br/><br/> In one aspect, said each view comprises a spread.  In another aspect, said each view comprises a view in a three dimensional (3D) interface.  In another aspect, said media-rich project is a photo-project.  In another aspect, said photo-project
is a photobook.
<br/><br/> In one aspect, the method further comprises, confirming by said user at said second view to exit from said second view before landing on said last-edited view, wherein said step of confirming adds a third step to said user reverse action.
<br/><br/> In one aspect, The method, further comprises, creating a manifested preview of said photobook, wherein said manifested preview is a three-dimensional virtual production of a printable photobook graphically showing a front cover, a back cover, a
spine, and said spreads, wherein said front cover, said back cover, and said spreads are virtually turnable via the input device.
<br/><br/> In one aspect, said spread comprise automatic grouping of a plurality of photos, wherein said grouping is based on at least one aspect of image heuristics, wherein said at least one aspect of image heuristics comprises a use case.  In another
aspect, an uploaded photo, by image analysis, is analyzed to determine appropriateness and to extract image metadata.
<br/><br/> In one aspect, the method further comprises, displaying an indicator, before said first user reverse action, wherein said indicator indicates that said first user reverse action will change views from said second view back to said last-edited
view.
<br/><br/> In another aspect, the present invention is a non-transitory, computer-readable, physical storage medium storing executable instructions, which when executed by a hardware processor, causes the processor to perform a process of creating a
media-rich project or product by reversing edit operations in a client-server environment, the instructions causing the processor to perform the steps of reversing the editing operations as taught in the preceding paragraphs.
<br/><br/> In another aspect, the present invention is a system for creating a media-rich project or product by reversing edit operations, the system comprising a user device having a processor, a display, and a first memory; a server comprising a second

<br/><br/> More specific embodiments of the present invention are now discussed with illustrative purposes in reference to a photobook editing application.  However, as described previously, the application of the intelligent undo operation as described in
the present application is not limited to photobook editing software, and is applicable to any application or software package in which multiple views of a media-rich project are available for navigation and edit.
<br/><br/> Generally, to create a photobook online, a user needs to select photos from a user-device, such as a laptop or mobile device.  Once the photos are selected, the photos are uploaded to a server.  Upon image analysis of the uploaded photos by the
server, the server provides essential tools to the user-device to build a photobook.  A server operates within a client-server architecture of a computer system.  A server comprises computer hardware and software to serve computational requests of other
programs or clients.  A client comprises a user-device, such as, a laptop, a smartphone, or a desktop PC.  A server performs tasks on behalf of clients.  A server often provides services via the Internet or other network.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the media-based project comprises a physical manifestation of the project, resulting in a printed photobook, photo album, or other physical manifestation of the project.  A photobook may be printed on a canvas or photo
quality paper and bound together as a book.  The media-based project also includes an online product comprising: audio, video, image and text--all packaged together as a single cohesive item or product for display or sharing through online means or
electronic means, or for ordering a physical version of said online product.
<br/><br/> A media-based project is not limited to a photobook.  A photobook is a physical manifestation of the project in the form of a printed product.  A physical manifestation may not be necessary in other embodiments, such as, an online video album,
an online photo album, a virtual manufacturing product, a 3D visual product, and/or combinations thereof.  In the description that follows, a photobook may be used as a representative of any type of media-based project.
<br/><br/> MONTAGE, MOSAIC, and MIXBOOK are trademark names carrying embodiments of the present invention, and hence, the aforementioned trademark names may be collectively or interchangeably used in the specification and drawings to refer to the
products/services offered by embodiments of the present invention.  Because all of the products are created from media-files using a graphical manipulation system provided by the inventors as a network-based software application, the relative terms
descriptive of the overall process and for the providing company are MONTAGE, MOSAIC, and/or MIXBOOK.  The terms MONTAGE, MOSAIC, and/or MIXBOOK may be used in this specification to describe the overall media-based product creation and editing process of
the invention, the website, mobile app, or web-app through which the process is made accessible to authorized users, and/or the service-providing company.  With reference to the figures, embodiments of the present invention are now described in detail.
<br/><br/>System Architecture
<br/><br/> FIG. 1A shows a schematic diagram of a network configuration 1A100 for practicing embodiments of the present invention (this embodiment is sometimes known as "MONTAGE").  A user-device or devices may be connected to the Internet using a wireless
network or wired network.  A user-device may be a smartphone 1A102, laptop 1A104, desktop PC 1A106, or tablet 1A108.  The wireless network comprises a cellular tower 1A110, or a wireless router 1A112.  User-devices are connected to servers comprising a
web server 1A114, an application server 1A116, and a database server 1A118.  The servers are connected to a user-device through the wireless network, or the wired network 1A120.  The wired network 1A120 or the wireless network may employ technologies and
protocols comprising Ethernet technology, Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), and optical network, and the like.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 1B-1 and 1B-2 show a flow diagram of an exemplary embodiment 1B200 showing a method of background uploading of media-files while an Internet user is customizing a media-based project, which in this embodiment is a photobook.  An Internet
user (hereinafter "user") starts the process of creating a media-based project (hereinafter "project") using a user-device at step 1B202.  The term photobook or project may be used interchangeably.  The user logs in at step 1B204 using the user-device. 
After the user logs in at the user-device, at step 1B206 the user selects original media files or images for creating a photobook.  At step 1B206, following the log-in process at the user-device, the user is provided a workspace (also called "editor")
where the user can practice or utilize various embodiments of the present invention to customize, edit or create the photobook.  After the selection of images is made, then at step 1B208, optionally and in some embodiments, the client-device analyses the
images.  Once the optional image analysis is completed at the client-device, at step 1B210 the original images are resized to smaller sized image files and a meta-data is extracted from each original image.  Meta-data is a type of data that is relevant
to or embedded in an image.  Meta-data comprises digital data about a media file.  In one embodiment, meta-data is an Exchangeable Image File format data, or "EXIF" data (also in some cases known as "Exif" data).  EXIF is a standard that specifies a
format for images, sound, geolocation data (provided by a Global Positioning Receiver or GPS receiver attached to a camera), and ancillary tags used by digital cameras, smartphone cameras, scanners, and other systems that handle image and/or sound files
recorded by digital cameras.  EXIF data comprises a broad spectrum of data, including, but not limiting to, date and time information of images taken, GPS location of images, camera settings (camera make and model, image orientation or rotation,
aperture, shutter speed, focal length, metering mode, and ISO information), a thumbnail of the image, a description of the images, and/or copyright information thereof.
<br/><br/> At step 1B212, the resized image files and the meta-data are uploaded to the server.  The resized image files are smaller in size as compared to the larger sized original images, but not so small as to be un-useable by the server for image
analysis.  The resized images are immediately provided to the user-device for building the project.  After the resized images and the extracted meta-data of the original images are uploaded to the server, step 1B214 will follow to begin uploading the
original images to the server in a background computer process at the user-device.  Using the uploaded resized images and the meta-data, at step 1B216, the server performs a server-side image analysis.  An image analysis comprises image optimization
algorithms, image ranking algorithms, feature or object detection algorithms, use case formation techniques, layout, and/or photobook design formation techniques, as described in greater detail below.  Once the server-side image analysis is completed, at
step 1B218, the server converts the resized uploaded media files into multiple sizes or multiple (plural) compression levels (the term "compressed media file" or "compressed image" is used herein to refer to a media file that has been in some way
modified by the server and of a different size from the resized file uploaded from the client to the server).  At step 1B220, the server provides to the user-device a compressed image, or an image of a size relevant to the scope of the project
(photobook).  The server converts a resized image into many different sizes (called "compressed files" herein) so that each size may be called by the user-device depending on the scope of the project.  The scope of the project may comprise different
sizes and different resolutions of image files, wherein the server performs the server-side image reduction to prepare images of different sizes as needed by the project.  While the server performs the server-side image reduction using the resized image
files, the original image files are still uploading in the background computer process.  At step 1B226, the server provides analytical data to the user.  At step 1B222, the user pulls relevant image data comprising image files and analytical data from
the server.  At step 1B224, the user continues customizing (building) the photobook or project.  At step 1B228, the original image files may or still may not be uploaded [completed upload] to the server.  If the original image files are uploaded to the
server, the user continues building the photobook as shown by step 1B224.  If the original image files are not uploaded, the photobook customization still continues at step 1B234.  If the original image files are uploaded and the photobook customization
continues (and thus completes), the photobook will be ready to order at step 1B224.  At step 1B232, the user can place an order to print the photobook.  Once the photobook is ordered and printed at step 1B232, the embodiment 1B200 ends at step 1B246.
<br/><br/> In the event that the upload of the original images is not complete, the user still customizes (and thereby completes) the photobook at step 1B234, and is ready to order the photobook at step 1B236.  The user places the order at step 1B238. 
Once the order is placed at step 1B238 and the original images are still not uploaded, the embodiment 1B200 provides the user a widget to upload [begin a new upload or complete the ongoing upload] the original image files that the user selects.  Step
1B238 allows the user to order the photobook before the upload of the original image files completes.  At step 1B240, the embodiment 1B200 provides the user an optional uploading mechanism of original image files if the user does not have time to wait
until the original images are uploaded to the server before placing an order to print the photobook.  However, in another embodiment, step 1B240 can happen before step 1B238 and/or before the step 1B236; that is, a widget to upload original images may be
provided to the user-device before placing an order, or before the order is ready.  In other words, steps discussed herein may be switched, overlapped, or altered as long as the spirit of the present invention is consistent with the plurality of
embodiments described herein.  An uploading widget may comprise a software application that the user can download from an embodiment of the present invention.  Once the widget is downloaded and installed at the user-device, the user can begin uploading
or continue uploading the original image files using the installed widget.  At step 1B242, the original image files are uploaded to the server with the aid of the widget.  After the original image files are uploaded to the server, at step 1B244 the
server can send the order to print the finished product.  The embodiment thereby ends at step 1B246.

<br/><br/> FIG. 1R-1 is a screenshot embodiment 1R-100 showing an uploading process of photos in a mobile device.  Once photos are selected for an upload, the mobile device uploads the images to a server.  While the images are uploading to the server, the
mobile device displays a message 1R-102 in a form of graph or text showing that image or photo uploading is in progress.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1R-2 is a flow diagram showing an embodiment 1R-200 of a process to create a photobook using a mobile device (or a space-constrained device).  The process starts at step 1R-202.  At step 1R-204, a user of the mobile device selects photos at
a display or screen of the mobile device.  Once the photos are selected, the present invention at step 1R-206 creates a page preview of the selected photos.  The page preview displays all pages and spreads of the photobook, in which the pages or spreads
comprise selected photos, along with a theme and a design.  The theme and the design may be automatically populated.  A use case for the photos may be automatically selected.  While on the page preview, the user is provided at step 1R-208 book
customization options.  The book customization options comprise dragging and dropping of photos, pages, and spreads.  When a photo, a page, or a spread is dragged from one location and dropped to a next location, the user can create a desired pairing
arrangement of photos, pages, and spreads.  Once the desired pairing arrangement is achieved or the book customization options are completed, a book preview is created at step 1R-210.  In the book preview, the user can see a virtual manifestation of a
photobook that is printable and shippable.  The book preview is also a bird's eye view of a deliverable photobook that the user is expected to receive in the mail after an order to print the photobook is received.  In the book preview, the user can view
the design of a front cover of the book or even customize the cover.  The user can further virtually flip the pages of the book, and view the design of each page or spread in the book.  When the user is satisfied with the book preview, an order to print
the book is placed at step 1R-212.  The process ends at step 1R-214.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1R-3 is a screenshot embodiment 1R-300 showing a page preview of a photobook at a display of a mobile device.  After a user selects photos in a display 1R-308 of a mobile device, a page preview is shown to the user in the same display.  The
page preview comprises pages and spreads.  A spread consists of two opposite, or opposing, pages.  For example, a page 1R-302 and a page 1R-304 together make a spread.  A placeholder gap of a page or spread behaves in the same manner like a placeholder
gap of a photo.  A long tap by a finger or stylus at a page or spread will cause the page or spread to pop out.  Once the page or spread pops out, the page or the spread can be dragged along the direction of the finger or stylus that is being used on the
touch screen display (touch interface) of the user device.  Once the user is happy with the page preview, the user can click the soft "done" button 1R-306 to end the page preview.
<br/><br/> When tapping the soft "Rearrange Photos" button, the user is presented a spread-based grid of prior-selected pictures.  In one embodiment, horizontal spacing between spreads is smaller than the vertical one.  This is to communicate a correct
order in which photos are arranged, which is from left to right, and not from top to bottom.  This way, for example, a top-left spread contains a first and a second photo, and a next spread to its right contains a third and a fourth photo, and so on.
<br/><br/> A long tap will cause a tapped photo to pop-out (move up, so that the user can see the photo s/he selected under his/her finger) and leave a square shadow placeholder gap at its initial position.  A shadow placeholder gap is a non-interactive
element that shows the position where a selected photo is going to land if dropped or released by the finger.  After being selected, a photo can be moved around the display screen or touch screen to a different position.  When brought close to the edge
of another photo in the grid, that another photo will slide to a side (left or right depending on its index) revealing a new shadow-placeholder gap (while the initial placeholder gap fades away) where it is going to land if dropped.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, when a selected photo is hovering over the center of a spread, only one photo in that spread will slide and reveal a placeholder gap, and when the selected photo is moved to a side of a spread, both photos in that spread will
slide to a side and reveal a placeholder gap.
<br/><br/> Releasing a photo will result in it "landing" on the placeholder gap.  The placeholder gap will fade out in the process, the photo taking the position in the gap, and triggering an animation of all photos between the placeholder and the initial
position of the selected photo to move (rearrange).
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a user can drag and drop a page.  In another embodiment, the user can drag and drop two opposing pages or a spread.  A page may be configured to comprise more than one photo.  A spread may be configured to comprise more than
two photos.  A spread (two opposing pages) may just comprise one photo.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1R-4 is a screenshot embodiment 1R-400 showing dragging of a photo in a mobile device.  A mobile device 1R-402 shows a page preview of a photobook, in which the page preview displays all photos in the photobook.  Using a touch interface in
the display of the mobile device, a finger 1R-404 can drag a photo 1R-408.  Before dragging, the photo 1R-408 was initially located at the placeholder gap 1R-406.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1R-5 is a screenshot embodiment 1R-500 showing a photo before being dragged in a mobile device.  In a mobile device 1R-502, a photo 1R-506 is dragged by a finger 1R-504.  Dragging is initiated by a long tap on the photo 1R-506 using the
finger 1R-504 at the display of the mobile device.  A long tap causes the photo 1R-506 to pop out.  Once the photo 1R-506 pops out, the photo moves along the direction of the finger 1R-504 as the finger 1R-504 moves around the display.  Once a
rearrangement of photos is completed, a user can press a soft "Done" button 1R-508.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1R-6 is a screenshot embodiment 1R-600 showing a photo before being dropped in the display of a mobile device.  A photo 1R-606 is dragged from the placeholder gap 1R-604 by using a finger 1R-602.  Dragging is initiated by a long tap on the
photo.  A long tap causes the photo 1R-606 to pop out.  The finger when released from the touch display causes the photo 1R-606 to drop.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1R-7 is a screenshot embodiment 1R-700 showing a photo after being dropped in a display screen of a mobile device.  After a photo 1R-702 is dropped, a vacant placeholder gap of the photo is closed by sliding left or right of adjacent
photos.  Photos 1R-704 and 1R-706 slide along with other photos, to close the placeholder gap of the photo that was dragged and dropped.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1R-8 is a screenshot embodiment 1R-800 showing a completed project (virtually manifested photobook) in a mobile device.  A virtual photobook is flappable.  A virtual photobook 1R-802 is created after a user finishes book customization
options including dragging and dropping of photos, pages, and spreads.  The user can shuffle photos in the cover page of the photobook by using a soft "Shuffle Cover" button 1R-804.  After the user is satisfied with the design of the virtual photobook
1R-802, the user can proceed to order the photobook by pressing a soft button "Place Order" 1R-806.  If the user is not satisfied with the design of the photobook, the user can go back to drag and drop photos, pages, and spreads by using the soft arrow
button 1R-808.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1R-9 is a screenshot embodiment 1R-900 showing an opened cover page of a photobook in a mobile device.  In a mobile device 1R-902, a virtual photobook is produced.  The virtual photobook resembles a photobook that will eventually be
produced by printing and binding after an order is received.  A finger 1R-908 can flip a cover page 1R-904.  The cover page 1R-904 may be designed in a way that shows a glimpse of what photos are inside the book.  Miniature photos can be shown through
the openings in the cover page, in a manner that the next page 1R-906 shows all miniature photos.  A cover page is a matter of design choice.  The photos can be re-arranged by using the soft "Rearrange Photos" button 1R-910, returning the user to FIG.
1R-4.  Once the user is satisfied with the design of the book, the user can press the soft "Next" button 1R-912 to place an order to print the book.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1R-10 is a screenshot embodiment 1R-1000 showing a manifested virtual photobook with flappable pages and spreads.  The manifested virtual photobook resembles a photobook that will eventually be produced by printing and binding after an
order is received.  The actual photobook may be received via the mail after an order is placed to print the book.  The virtual photobook as shown in a display of a mobile device is flappable to see all pages and spreads in the book, and the associated
photos and design.  A user can use a finger to flip pages.  The user can view, such as, a page 1R-1004 that comprises a photo, turn another page 1R-1006 using the finger, and view a next page 1R-1002.  After the user is satisfied with the contents and
design of the book, the user can place an order to print the book by pressing the soft "Place Order" button 1R-1008.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1S is a screenshot embodiment 1S1700 showing a completed photobook (project) at a mobile device, identical to that shown in FIG. 1R-8.  A design of a photobook 1S1702 is virtually manifested on the display of a mobile device.  A user can
shuffle images on a cover design (cover page) by using a soft "Shuffle Cover" button 1S1704.  The present invention populates a design of every page or spread of the photobook 1S1702.  The photobook 1S1702 is virtually flappable.  The user may customize
every page of the photobook 1S1702 by using image editing tools provided by the present invention.  The user-device or a server may provide image editing tools to the user.  Image editing may also be performed by the server as a part of image analysis. 
After book customizations are completed, the user can proceed to order the photobook by pressing a soft button "Place Order" 1S1706.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1T is a screenshot embodiment 1T1800 showing a method of ordering a project (photobook or book) at a mobile device.  Once a user completes a customization of a photobook, an order information 1T1802 is displayed at the mobile device.  The
user can specify a quantity of the order at the quantity area 1T804.  Price information is also included with the quantity information.  The user can enter a shipping address in the area 1T1806, and an email address in the area 1T1808.  The user
continues a processing of payment for the order by pressing a button payment information 1T1810.  The button payment information 1T1810 directs the user to a payment-processing gateway to complete the order.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1U is an embodiment of a user-device wherein the invention may be practiced.  A user-device comprises a processor 1U1902, an operating system 1U1914, an application software 1U1916, a memory 1U1904, at least one input device 1U1906, at
least one output device 1U1908, a mass storage device 1U1910, and a network 1U1912.  The network 1U1912 comprises a wired or wireless network to communicate to remote servers and databases via the Internet.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1V is a timing diagram 1V2000 showing a method of background uploading of media files.  Steps in the embodiment 1V2000 are shown using timelines or progress bars.  A user at step 1V2002 selects original photos or images for an upload.  Once
photos are selected, an uploading screen appears acknowledging the user that the upload is in progress.  At step 1V2004, a use case is created to build a project.  The use case is created by a server after performing a server-side image analysis.  At
step 1V2006, the user can further customize the project by adding a storyline or narrative of the project.  A person of ordinary skill in the art of image uploading and editing can implement FLEX technology at step 1V2008.  FLEX comprises photo-resizing
libraries.  In one embodiment, once original photos are selected, FLEX creates medium sized photos by resizing the original photos.  However, FLEX may also create small sized photos from the original photos.  Both the medium sized photos and the small
sized photos are uploaded to the server at the step 1V2010.  An upload of small sized photos completes at step 1V2012.  An upload of the medium sized photos completes at step 1V2014.  The small sized photos are uploaded faster than the medium sized
photos.  Once the upload of medium sized photos completes, at step 1V2016 the FLEX API builds a story or use case.  Once a use case or story (by grouping of similar photos) is built, the user can add a storyline or narrative to the project.  FLEX and the
FLEX API are an exemplary technology that maybe used to implement the embodiment 1V2000 of the present invention.  The methods of the present invention are not restrictive to FLEX and the FLEX API.
<br/><br/> A use case may be built by feature or object identification of images, geo-location data, and meta-data.  For example, when a plurality of images is selected by a user for building a book, images are grouped together by similarity of objects or
features.  For example, wedding pictures may be grouped together from a plurality of random pictures by identifying the features of wedding, such as a wedding cake or an altar.  Facial recognition is another example of feature or object identification
that allows a formation of a use case or grouping of pictures together by facial similarity.  A use case of a book can allow the program to better prepare a template for the book, for example, a wedding book.

service.  In one embodiment a service provider providing the service of the present invention owns and maintains WS 1W2105.  WS 1W2105 hosts a website 1W2106, through which, users may access elements of the present invention.  Website 1W2106 is adapted
to provide authenticated access to users who create, publish, print, and purchase media-based products such as photo-books, photo-cards, photo-calendars, photo-posters, video-books, video-calendars, video-cards, and related products.
<br/><br/> Communications network 1W2100 also includes an access network (AN) 1W2104, which may represent any data network adapted to provide access to the Internet network 1W2101.  1W2104 may be a public-switched-telephone-network (PSTN) or some other
public or private telephony network.  AN 1W2104 may be a local wireless network, a cellular time division multiple access (CDMA) network, a wireless fidelity (WiFi) network, or any other candidate access network through which one may access the Internet
1W2101.
<br/><br/> A user may access WS 1W2105, more particularly MIXBOOK website 1W2106, through the Internet access facility 1W2107 in access network (AN) 1W2104 and an Internet access line 1W2120.  The Internet access facility 1W2107 may be maintained and
operated by an Internet service provider (ISP) or by a wireless Internet service provider (WISP), whichever is appropriate for any particular Internet connection.  Users who might access WS 1W2105 are represented herein as network-capable computing
appliances, more particularly, a laptop computer 1W2122, a desktop computer 1W2123, and a smart telephone 1W2124.  Each mentioned appliance may be assumed to be Internet-capable by way of one or more network browsing applications residing thereon and
executable there from.
<br/><br/> Desktop computer 1W2123 is connected to an Internet-connection server 1W2107 by way of an Internet access line 1W2126.  Desktop computer 1W2123, once connected, may access website 1W2106 hosted on WS 1W2105.  Desktop computer 1W2123 has one or
more input devices (not illustrated) coupled thereto such as a keyboard, a mouse, and a microphone for (Speech-to-Text Commands).  Smart phone 1W2124 may connect wirelessly via a wireless link 1W2127 to an Internet service provider (also represented by
machine 1W2107) that establishes a wireless Internet connection like public WiFi for example.  Smart phone 1W2124 may or may not include a keyboard input device.  In one embodiment smartphone 1W2124 has a touch-screen display.  Laptop 1W2122 is
illustrated as connected wirelessly to the Internet 1W2101 via WISP 1W2107 using wireless link 1W2128.  Laptop 1W2122 includes a keyboard and/or other input devices as may be appropriate.
<br/><br/> Laptop 1W2122, desktop 1W2123, and smartphone 1W2124 each include an Internet browser application (not illustrated) for accessing and navigating network 1W2101.  Backbone 1W2116 supports a runtime server (RS) 1W2109 adapted to host a MIXBOOK
user-interface 1W2110.  User interface 1W2110 is accessible to all website visitors for the purpose of creating, manipulating, and printing media-based products such as a photo collage book, for example.  Users accessing website 1W2106 who are ready to
create a product may be re-directed to RS 1W2109.
<br/><br/> Each user authorized to create and publish a media-based product using the site may receive a small download containing a compact editing package known as the MIXBOOK editor ("MBE") in some embodiments.  MBE 1W2125a is installed as a
browser-based extension or plug-in in one embodiment on desktop computer 1W2123.  Laptop 1W2122 has an instance of MBE 1W2125b installed as a browser-based extension or plug-in. Smartphone 1W2124 has an instance of MBE 1W2125c installed as a
browser-based extension or plug-in. An instance of MBE may be customized for any computing appliance that may access the Internet and through which a user may see and edit content.  Therefore, MBE instances 1W2125 (a-c), though the same basic extension
or plug-in, may contain differences based on host requirements.  In one embodiment of the present invention there are no software downloads required in order to practice the present invention.  In this case the MIXBOOK editing SW may be server hosted
only.  In another embodiment, the MIXBOOK editing SW may be ported to a desktop application such as ADOBE AIR and thus be operated as a desktop application.  In one embodiment the SW is included as an add-on feature to any suitable desktop application
and may be installed on a computing host with that desktop application from a removable medium such as a CD ROM, for example.
<br/><br/> Service provider facility 1W2107 includes a connected data repository 1W2108.  Data repository 1W2108 contains all of the customer contact and billing information for the Internet service provider.  One with skill in the art will appreciate many
possible Internet connection schemes.  It is preferred in most embodiments that users have a high speed Internet connection for the purpose of manipulating and editing graphics, which can be bandwidth intensive.  The inventors provide one or more
innovative solutions for saving bandwidth while editing images and image products online making the entire experience more efficient and easier for users practicing the invention.
<br/><br/> The MIXBOOK website 1W2106 establishes a community-based portal and social interaction site that revolves around creating, editing, sharing publishing, printing, and purchasing media-based products created online by one or more user working in
collaboration together.  Users such as those operating appliances 1W2122-1W2124 connect online and navigate to WS 1W2105 to access website 1W2106.  When any user determines to create a media-based product like a photo album, for example, the user is
directed to an appropriate portal server like RS 1W2109 hosting MIXBOOK user interface (UI) 1W2110.  UI 1W2110 is adapted to provide all of the assets needed to create and publish complete image and/or text-based products.  Media-based products created
through website 1W2106 include products containing images uploaded by one or more authorized users.  Any work in progress or completed is termed a project.  A project may be initiated by one user whereby other users are then invited by the initiating to
join the creative experience in collaboration, and those users may contribute their own photos to the project.  Such a project may be published for viewing by all or some of the community.  Finished projects may be printed and distributed as "hard
products" available for purchase by members of the community.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a persistent storage of graphics uploaded by community members to be included into projects is obtained (leased) through a third-party storage provider.  In this example, a simple storage service (S3) data storage cloud 1W2102
is illustrated and made available for use by a third-party service provider such as AMAZON.  A storage server 1W2112 is illustrated within S3 cloud 1W2102 and has connection to the Internet backbone 1W2116.  SS 1W2112 may be one of many servers including
associated mass data repositories connected to SS 1W2112 such as repository 1W2113 contained within storage cloud 1W2102.  In this logical representation all of the graphics (images or photos) that are uploaded to insert into projects are stored in a
repository such as repository 1W2113 in storage cloud 1W2102.  Repository 1W2113 may be an optical, magnetic, or some other type of data storage facility.  In one embodiment, mass computations required for real-time and transparent editing and
collaborating on multiple projects are performed by virtual machine instances 1W2120 in a computing cloud 1W2103.  In another embodiment, the service host may maintain one or more powerful computing machines and storage devices for performing
computations and for storing graphics for users of the service.
<br/><br/> In use of the present invention a user operating one of computing appliances 1W2122-1W2124 connects online and accesses MIXBOOK website 1W2106 and logs into the site.  If the user has already registered and created a project, a web page
personalized to that user is served that includes all of that user's projects in the latest states of progress.  The user may enter any project for which she or he has authorization to contribute to, and may review, edit, or otherwise work the project. 
Photos uploaded by the user to include into projects may be stored in cloud 1W2102 and served to the projects when needed by the system.  Any computing such as editing, resizing, alterations, and so on may be handled in cloud 1W2103.  A user may, through
website 1W2106, authorize other users registered with the service of the invention to collaborate on a project initiated by that user.  In one embodiment, a user having a project initiated may invite other potential users to the site so they may, with
permissions, enter the site and collaborate with that user.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the present invention, photos that are stored on the Internet can be represented in any online project provided the user has authorized access to those photos.  For example, a user who has one or more accounts to third-party
social interaction networks like <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> MYSPACE, PHOTOBUCKET, FLICKR, or similar sites may use photos of registered friends that they are allowed to access in their own personal projects.  These photos do not have to be uploaded to the service of the
present invention.  Rather, these photos can be accessed from their present storage locations anywhere on the Internet provided that the storage system is online.
<br/><br/> The Internet backbone 1W2116 supports a <b><i>FACEBOOK</i></b> server (FB) 1W2114 coupled to a data repository 1W2115 for storing images and other graphics.  The Internet backbone 1W2116 supports a MYSPACE server (MS) 1W2111 coupled to a data repository
1W2117 adapted to store images and other graphics.  Backbone 1W2116 supports a FLICKR server (FL) 1W2118 coupled to a data repository 1W2119 adapted to store images and other graphics.  Any of these images can be served to an active project by the
respective servers directly from their storage locations.  Any of these images that are altered during project work or collaboration may be subsequently saved to third-party S3 storage cloud 1W2102 in repository 1W2113 controlled by SS 1W2112.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the present invention, MIXBOOK website 1W2106 includes or has working access to a SW print engine (not illustrated here) that is adapted to render any MIXBOOK project for professional printing.  In one embodiment, printing
is performed by a third-party provider who may also ship and/or distribute finished products for a price.  In one embodiment, a user may access the service through Website 1W2106 and may initiate and complete a project that will be printed for that user
for a static price for that particular product.
<br/><br/> It is noted herein that a project created on MIXBOOK may be efficiently gathered for print in virtually any print format.  Likewise, content originally laid out in one format or aspect ratio may be efficiently converted to another layout before
printing in an automated process that incorporates the typical size and layout changes necessary to convert from one layout to another automatically.  Furthermore, content assembled for a particular layout and product type may be automatically converted
for print output in another layout and product type.
<br/><br/> The disclosed embodiments improve upon the problems with the prior art by providing a system that allows for quick and easy creation of media-based projects over a communications network.  The disclosed embodiments leverage the reduced costs of
processing units in most servers and computers to provide various functions over a communications network to automate, either fully or partially, the process of creating a media-based project over the Internet.  The disclosed embodiments automate the
processes normally undertaken by users creating photo-based projects online, such as sorting through photos, removing the photos that are not adequate or properly focused, choosing the correct photos, grouping photos together by topic or location,
ordering the photos by chronological order, and cropping or focusing photos on the relevant portions of the photos.  Thus the disclosed embodiments reduce the amount of time required by users to create a photo-based project.  Further, the disclosed
embodiments automate the corrections or modifications normally performed by users creating photo-based projects, such as correctly orienting photos, re-coloring photos or performing a color correction on the photos, removing red-eye from the eyes of
photo subjects, and correcting the photos for brightness or contrast.  This eliminates the requirement that the user must open a special program or app to perform the correction or modification, thereby removing the time-consuming and frustrating nature
of these steps when performed manually.  The disclosed embodiments are further beneficial because, due to their timesaving nature, they reduce the number of users that drop off or discontinue the photo-book creation process before completing a purchase.
<br/><br/>Auto-Creation of Projects Utilizing Use Case Data
<br/><br/> FIG. 2A shows an illustration of a block diagram showing a network architecture of a system 2A200 and method for facilitating the creation of photo-based projects over a communications network in accordance with one embodiment.  FIG. 2A shows
various components coupled with network 2A206, which can be a circuit switched network, such as the Public Service Telephone Network (PSTN), or a packet switched network, such as the Internet or the World Wide Web, the global telephone network, a
cellular network, a mobile communications network, or any combination of the above.  A prominent element of FIG. 2A is the server 2A202 associated with a data repository or server-side database 2A204 and further coupled with network 2A206.  Server 2A202
collects, processes and manages data from the users 2A210 and further manages the server-side database 2A204, which holds the master copy of data that is served to fulfillment entity 2A250 and client device 2A220.  FIG. 2A further includes user 2A210 and
his or her client computing device 2A220, which may be a desktop computer, a common computer terminal, or mobile computing devices such as smart phones, mobile phones, tablet computers, handheld computers, laptops, or the like.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2A shows an embodiment of the present invention wherein networked client computing device 2A220 interacts with server 2A202 and server-side database 2A204 over the network 2A206.  Server 2A202 may comprise one or more servers, workstations,
desktop computers, computer terminals, workstations, mainframes, mobile computing devices, smart phones, mobile phones, handheld computers, laptops, or the like.  Server 2A202 and client computing device 2A220 include program logic comprising computer
source code, scripting language code, or interpreted language code that may be compiled to produce an executable file or computer instructions, or that may be interpreted at run-time, wherein the computer source code performs various functions of the
present invention.  Server 2A202 may include a software engine that executes applications as well as delivers applications, data, program code, and other information to networked computing devices, such as device 2A220.  FIG. 2A further shows a database
or repository 2A204, which may be a relational database comprising a Structured Query Language (SQL) database stored in a SQL server.  The repository 2A204 serves data from a database, which is a repository for data used by server 2A202 and device 2A220
during the course of operation of the invention.  Database 2A204 may be distributed over one or more nodes or locations that are connected via network 2A206.  The database 2A204 may include user account records, user records, and multimedia records that
include images, video, audio and like.
<br/><br/> It should be noted that although FIG. 2A shows only one server 2A202, one database 2A204, one client device 2A220, and customer 2A210, the system of the present invention supports any number of servers, databases, client devices, and customers
connected via network 2A206.  Also note that server 2A202 is shown as a single and independent entity; in one embodiment, the functions of server 2A202 may be integrated with another entity, such as one image provider 2A240, fulfillment entity 2A250,
device 2A220, and/or the database 2A204.  Further, server 2A202 and its functionality, according to a preferred embodiment, can be realized in a centralized fashion in one computer system or in a distributed fashion wherein different elements are spread
across several interconnected computer systems.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2A further shows fulfillment party 2A250, which performs product fulfillment or order fulfillment services, i.e., the process of fulfilling the obligation of server 2A202 (or the entity represented by server 2A202) to send user 2A210 one or
more photo-based project products 2A252 that the customer has ordered, purchased, or requested from the server 2A202 (or the entity represented by server 2A202).  Fulfillment party 2A250 may receive orders for the photo-based project products, print the
photo-based project products, bind the photo-based project products, package the products, and then ship the ordered products 2A252 to the end customer, such as user 2A210.  In the course of a transaction, the server 2A202 may interface with fulfillment
party 2A250 to effectuate the delivery of purchased products to the customers after payment has been effectuated.  Note that although fulfillment party 2A250 is shown as a single and independent entity, in one embodiment of the present invention, the
functions of fulfillment party 2A250 may be integrated with another entity, such as server 2A202.  Further, the functionality of fulfillment party 2A250 may be realized in a centralized fashion in one computer system or in a distributed fashion wherein
different elements are spread across several interconnected computer systems.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 2B to 2C depict, among other things, the data flow (2A260) and control flow (2C200) in the process for facilitating the creation of photo-based projects over a communications network 2A206, according to one embodiment.  The process 2C200
of the disclosed embodiments begins with step 2C202, wherein the user 2A210 provides, via his or her device 2A220 over the network 2A206, at least a plurality of images or photos 2B264 to the server 2A202 for storage in the database 2A204.  In one
embodiment, the images or photos 2B264 are provided to server 2A202 via a graphical user interface executing on the device 2A220.  In another embodiment, the images or photos 2B264 are provided to server 2A202 for storage in the database 2A204 via TCP/IP
and/or HTTP over network 2A206.  Subsequently, server 2A202 stores the images or photos 2B264 in the database 2A204 as records 2B266.  In one embodiment, the records 2B266 are stored in association with an identity for user 2A210 or in association with a
user record for user 2A210.
<br/><br/> Next, in step 2C204, the user 2A210 provides, via his device 2A220 over the network 2A206, a use-case identifier 2B266 to the server 2A202 for storage in the database 2A204.  In one embodiment, the use-case identifier 2B266 is provided to server
2A202 via a graphical user interface executing on the device 2A220.  In another embodiment, the use-case identifier 2B266 is provided to server 2A202 for storage in the database 2A204 via TCP/IP and/or HTTP over network 2A206.  Subsequently, server 2A202
stores the use-case identifier 2B266 in the database 2A204 in association with records 2B266.  In one embodiment, the use-case identifier 2B266 is stored in association with an identity for user 2A210 or in association with a user record for user 2A210.
<br/><br/> In the following step 2C206, various photo analysis processes may be executed on the images or photos 2B264 stored in the database 2A204 as records 2B266, at the direction of the user 2A210 via input provided via a graphical user interface
executing on the device 2A220.  The photo analysis processes comprise identifying similar images, identifying faces in the images, identifying objects in the images, identifying undesirable images, and identifying relevant portions of the images.  The
identification of faces and objects may be accomplished via object recognition and face recognition libraries.  The identification of similar images may be accomplished via an analysis and comparison of color, focus, brightness, faces, objects and the
like in each image, as described in greater detail below.  The identification of undesirable images may be accomplished by identifying images that are out of focus or contain too little light for a proper exposure.  For blurry photos, edge detection may
be used to detect any sharp edges, if any.  The identification of the relevant portions of an image may be accomplished by identifying the relevant portions of an image, such as faces and objects that may have been recognized.  By applying saliency
filters, a bounding box may be drawn around a focus of an image.  Thus, if the relevant faces or objects are located on the sides of the image, the image may be zoomed or cropped to highlight the identified relevant area.  The photo analysis processes
may further include identifying images with an incorrect orientation, identifying images with incorrect color, brightness or contract, and/or identifying images with red-eye.
<br/><br/> In the following step 2C208, various photo correction processes may be executed on the images or photos 2B264 stored in the database 2A204 as records 2B266, at the direction of the user 2A210 via input provided via a graphical user interface
executing on the device 2A220.  The photo correction processes comprise: orienting images that have been identified as having an incorrect orientation to an appropriate orientation, adjusting images that have been identified as having an incorrect color,
brightness or contract to the correct color, brightness or contract, and removing red-eye from images that have been identified as having red-eye.
<br/><br/> In the following step 2C210, various use-case specific heuristics may be executed on the images or photos 2B264 stored in the database 2A204 as records 2B266, based on results of said photo analysis, at the direction of the user 2A210 via input
provided via a graphical user interface executing on the device 2A220.  The use-case specific heuristics comprise: grouping images that have previously been found to be similar, grouping images having identical or similar faces (based on the faces that
were previously identified), grouping images having identical objects (based on the objects that were previously identified), removing undesirable images (based on the images that were previously identified as undesirable), and cropping images to
highlight relevant portions of said images (based on the relevant portions of images that were previously identified).
<br/><br/> In executing the use-case specific heuristics, heuristics that correspond to the use-case identifier 2B266 are utilized.  Different use-cases may require different heuristics.  For example, a use-case identifier 2B266 that identifies a wedding
would result in heuristics that: group images having the faces of the bride and groom (based on the faces that were previously identified), group images having the wedding cake or the altar (based on the objects that were previously identified), and crop
images to highlight portions of said images having the faces of the bride and groom (based on the relevant portions of images that were previously identified).  Instructions 2B268 in database 2A204 may instruct server 2A202 on which heuristics correspond
to each potential use-case identifier 2B266 provided by user 2A210.
<br/><br/> As an example, with regard to grouping images having the faces of the bride and groom (based on the faces that were previously identified), using face detection, identifiers may be applied to each face to determine, for example, that person A
shows up in 85% of the photos, person B shows up in 73% of the photos, and person C shows up in 20% of the photos.  Therefore, person A and B are most likely the bride and groom.
<br/><br/> In the following step 2C212, various additional functions may be executed on the images or photos 2B264 stored in the database 2A204 as records 2B266, at the direction of the user 2A210 via input provided via a graphical user interface executing
on the device 2A220.  The additional functions may comprise: reading embedded date or location metadata from the images, performing a lookup of additional location data based on the embedded location metadata, and generating text boxes to be printed
below said images upon creation of the photo-based project 2A252.  The additional functions may also include ordering the images or photos 2B264 stored in the database 2A204 in chronological order, based on the time the images were taken or created.
<br/><br/> In one example of the execution of the process of step 2C212, the server 2A202 reads an image in EXIF format, a standard that specifies the formats for images and ancillary tags used by digital cameras (including smartphones), scanners and other
systems handling image files recorded by digital cameras.  The EXIF format may store date and time information of the image, camera settings of the image, thumbnails of the image, descriptions of the image, and copyright information for the image.  In
this example, the server 2A202 may read the location for the image from the file and generate a text box reflecting said location to be printed below said image upon creation of the photo-based project 2A252.  In another example, the server 2A202 may
read the location for the image from the file (in a GPS coordinate format), perform a lookup to find a corresponding text string that matches the GPS coordinate, and generate a text box having said text string to be printed below said image upon creation
of the photo-based project 2A252.  In this example, the server 2A202 may read the date and time for the images from their files and place the images or photos 2B264 in chronological order, based on the time the images were taken or created.
<br/><br/> In the following step 2C214, the creation process is concluded and the resulting photo-based project product is ordered, at the direction of the user 2A210 via input provided via a graphical user interface executing on the device 2A220.  In this
step, the server 2A202 sends a request 2B270 to the fulfillment party 2A250 for the photo-based project product 2A252.  In the following step 2C216, the fulfillment party 2A250 receives the request 2B270 for the photo-based project product 2A252, prints
the photo-based project product, binds the photo-based project product, packages the product, and then ships the ordered product 2A252 to the end customer, such as user 2A210.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2D shows an illustrative image analysis or photo processing process according to one embodiment of the invention.  The image analysis process shown in FIG. 2D is illustrative only, and is not intended to be limiting.  Various other image
analysis processes, some of which are described later, are also within the scope of the present invention.  This image analysis process describes an image similarity detection process, as illustrative of the image analysis processes that are useable with
the present invention.
<br/><br/> In one illustrative image analysis process shown in FIG. 2D, the process 2D200 examines the images for similarity by expressing a query to the image database 2D202 (all of the images) by requesting images that are similar to one of the images
(query image 2D208).  The process considers basic shape and color information of the photo when looking through the database for potential matches of similar photos.  Several factors make this matching process difficult.  The query image is typically
different from the target image, so the retrieval method must allow for some distortions.  Since these are natural photos taken in natural environments, the photos may suffer artifacts such as color shift, poor resolution, dithering effects, and
mis-registration.  Furthermore, it is important to perform the retrieval fast enough to not hamper user experience of the media-product creation process.
<br/><br/> When the images are first received by the server, a wavelet transform 2D204 is performed on every image in the image database 2D202.  By collecting just the few largest coefficients from this transform, the process distills a small "signature"
for each of the images.  These signatures are saved in a signature database 2D206 so that it is computationally efficient to compare them all to each other.
<br/><br/> When the process 2D200 requires photo(s) of similarity to a given query image 2D208, the process performs a wavelet transform 2D210 on the query image 2D208 to produce a signature 2D212 for the given query image 2D208.  This query signature
2D212 is compared to the signatures of the database images 2D206, and the best matches are retrieved by the process 2D200 for use in automatically creating, organizing, and presenting the media-based project to the user.
<br/><br/> The wavelet transform is used to analyze functions at different levels of detail; it is somewhat similar to the Fourier transform, but encodes both frequency and spatial information.  By saving the few largest wavelet coefficients for an image
(and throwing away all of the smaller coefficients), it is possible to recover a fairly accurate representation of the image.  This property may be exploited for efficiency gains to optimize image similarity comparisons.  For example, a wavelet
transformed image ("signature") that incorporates 400 coefficients would require about 3% as much disk space as the original image.  In one embodiment, it is possible to take a wavelet transform and keep just a few (for example, 20) coefficients for each
color channel and distill from them a small "signature" for each image.  Because the signature is so small, it permits very fast searching in the database.
<br/><br/>Additional MIXBOOK Embodiments
<br/><br/> FIG. 2E is an exemplary screen shot of an introduction page 2E200 of website 1W2106 of FIG. 1W according to an embodiment of the present invention.  Introduction page 2E200 includes interactive indicia 2E201, which includes an option for
retrieving help, signing up for service, and for logging into the service.  On the same title bar containing the interactive indicia 2E201 for signing up or signing into the process, there are the navigation options Learn More; Pricing; and Gallery.  The
option "learn more" leads to additional information about the services provided, such as product quality, use cases, etc. The pricing option brings up one or more complete pricing structures for the available products that can be created and printed. 
The option Gallery is an option that provides access to completed projects authorized for public viewing.
<br/><br/> Page 2E200 contains more than one feature advertisement 2E203.  Each feature advertisement may comment or provide some input, access to, or information about a feature of the service or fact about the providing company.  In the first feature
advertisement (center top) there is an interactive option 2E204 for getting started now.  Invocation of this interactive link may launch a registration or sign-up process followed by an opportunity to begin a MIXBOOK project.  Hyperlinked information is
provided on introduction page 2E200 under categories such as Learn More, Our Services, Idea Center, Programs, and Corporate.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, page 2E200 includes an option "try it now", which may be replace option 2E204.  Invoking such an option may take the "guest" to a MIXBOOK EDITOR without requiring them to login or have an account with the site.  Transparent to
the user, the system creates a temporary account for them.  If the new guest user attempts to save any work on the site they are asked to register as a user.
<br/><br/>Automatic Insertion of Content into Projects
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a flowchart 300 of an embodiment showing an automatic insertion of content into a design.  Content may comprise photos or images, text, and user inputs from a user.  At step 302, a user starts a process of automatic insertion of
content by using a user-device.  The user logs in at the user device at step 304.  After log-in, the user enters a workspace, an editor, or a graphical user interface (GUI) at the user device.  The user at step 306 selects images or photos from the user
device and uploads them to a server.  At step 308, the server performs an image analysis on the uploaded images.  After the images are analyzed, the server derives automatic image information from the uploaded images.  As shown in the list 310, automatic
image information is derived by using computer algorithms that include, but are not limited to, one or more of detecting areas of saliency, face detection, computer vision analysis, photo similarity detection, and analyzing photo information, text
matrix, photo captions, and so on.  Automatic image information is also derived from image meta-data.  After using the automatic image information derived by image analysis, the server at step 312 outputs a default design preview (an automated design) of
a photobook.  The design preview at step 312 also comprises a layout that is the basis for the design.
<br/><br/> At step 314, the server performs automatic content grouping of the uploaded images.  For automatic content grouping, the server utilizes, but is not limited to, one or more of the information in the list 320.  The list 320 comprises timestamps,
image similarities, image sequences, photo importance, aesthetics, and so on.  At step 316, the server automatically inserts content into the design of the photo project by using, but not limited to, one or more of the items (computer algorithms) in the
list 324.  The list 324 comprises image ranking, buffer calculation, areas of interest in an image, scores for insertion, best design determination, dynamic text insertion, photo position in a photo slot, and so on.
<br/><br/> The user previews the design at step 318.  The preview at step 318 is populated after completing the automatic image information extraction of one or more of the items in the list 310, after step 314 of automatic content grouping, and after step
316 of automatic content insertion.  The preview at step 318 is thus automatically populated by the server by using one or more of the items (computer algorithms) as shown by the lists 310, 320, and 324.  After the user previews the design, the user can
order the photobook at step 322.  At step 326, the order is sent to a printer.  The printer may be a third party printer, a social printer, or any industrial printer that is adapted to print photos on a photo quality paper.  The ordered photobook may be
printed on a preferred size of a photo paper.  The ordered photobook may be a shippable product to the user.  The printer may be further adapted to print a shipping label comprising the order information, and other relevant information.  The process ends
at step 328.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a flowchart 400 of an alternative embodiment showing a first insertion based on automatic image information and a second insertion based on observed image information of content into a design of a photo project.  At step 402, the
process starts at a user-device.  The user logs in at the user device at step 404.  After the log-in, the user enters a workspace, an editor, or a graphical user interface (GUI) at the user device.  The user at step 406 selects images or photos from the
user device and uploads them to a server.  At step 408, the server performs an image analysis on the uploaded images.  After the images are analyzed, the server derives automatic image information from the uploaded images.  As shown in the list 410,
automatic image information is derived by using computer algorithms that are relevant to areas of saliency, face detection, computer vision analysis, photo similarities, photo information, text matrix, and photo captions.  Automatic image information is
also derived from image meta-data.  After using the automatic image information derived by image analysis, the server at step 412 outputs a default design preview of a photobook.
<br/><br/> The default design generated at step 412 is based in part on step 416 of automatic content grouping and step 414 of automatic content insertion.  At step 416, the server performs automatic content grouping of the uploaded images.  For automatic
content grouping, the server utilizes the information comprising timestamps, image similarities, image sequences, photo importance, and aesthetics.  At step 414, the server automatically inserts content into the design of the photo project by using items
(computer algorithms) comprising image ranking, buffer calculation, areas of interest in an image, scores for insertion, best design determination, dynamic text insertion, and photo position in a photo slot.
<br/><br/> The default design at step 412 is based on a combination of computer algorithms in lists 410, 414, and 416.  The user previews the default design created by the server at the user device at step 418.  Furthermore, the user customizes the design
at step 420 by adding user interactions or user inputs.  User interactions or user inputs comprise area of interest selection, photo importance determination, and so on.  User interactions or user inputs are performed manually by the user.  By observing
and monitoring the user interactions at the GUI of the user device, the system is able to collect observed image information, which the system can use to improve on the automatic image information obtained by the system from image analysis.  The system
can monitor for such user interactions as zooming, panning, swapping photos, adding captions to photos, and so on.  After the customization by the user, a final recommended design based on the automatic image information and the observed image
information is generated by the system, and can be previewed by the user at step 422.  The user can then perform additional customizations to the final recommended design, and then order the photobook at step 424.  At step 426, the order is sent to a
printer as described previously.  The process ends at step 428.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a flowchart 500 of an alternative embodiment showing an insertion of content based on automatic and observed image information.  At step 502, the process starts at a user-device.  The user logs in at the user device at step 504.  After
the log-in, the user enters a workspace, an editor, or a graphical user interface (GUI) at the user device.  The user at step 506 selects images or photos from the user device and uploads them to a server.
<br/><br/> At step 510, the server performs an image analysis on the uploaded images.  After the images are analyzed, the server derives automatic image information from the uploaded images.  As shown in the list 512, automatic image information is derived
by using computer algorithms that are relevant to areas of saliency, face detection, computer vision analysis, photo similarities, photo information, text matrix, photo captions, and so on.  Automatic image information may also be derived from image
meta-data.  While the user is uploading original images to the server, the user can interact with a layout and a design of a photobook, and thus contribute to creating user inputs or user interactions with the design.  At step 508, the user interacts
with the images that are already uploaded to the server.  User interactions are also called manual interactions, manually observed information, user inputs, or user's behavioral observation.  As shown in the list 518, user interactions comprise one or
more of, but are not limited to, areas of interest in a photo, photo importance, panning, zooming, switching photos, and so on.  Not every possible user interaction is shown in list 518 for simplicity of explanation.  User inputs may also be called
tweaks, and give rise to observed image information.  By using user's manual inputs or user interactions (observed image information) along with the automatic image information derived though image analysis by the server, a default preview of the design
(an automated design) is generated at step 514.  The automated design is subject to manual edit by the user at any time before an order to print is placed and confirmed.
<br/><br/> At step 520, automatic content grouping of images is performed by using both observed image information from the user and automatic image information from the server.  Any errors made by the server in automatic content grouping is manually
corrected by the user at step 520.  For automatic content grouping, the server utilizes one or more of, but is not limited to, the items or information in the list 516.  The list 516 comprises timestamps, image similarities, image sequences, photo
importance, aesthetics, and so on.  User inputs at step 520 come from, but are not limited to, one or more items on the list 518.  At step 524, manual tweaks are performed to further customize content.  The server automatically inserts content into the
design of the photo project by using, but is not limited to, one or more of the items (computer algorithms) in the list 522.  The list 522 comprises image ranking, buffer calculation, areas of interest in an image, scores for insertion, best design
determination, dynamic text insertion, photo position in a photo slot, and so on.  Manual tweaks come from the list 518, but are not limited to the items shown.
<br/><br/> After performing manual tweaks at steps 520 and 524, the user previews a final recommended design of the photo project at step 526.  When the user is happy with the final recommended design, the user can order a photobook at step 528.  The order
may then be sent to a printer as previously described.  The process completes at step 530.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6A illustrates a diagram showing a relationship between a canvas, a design, a layout, a designset, and a layoutset, according to an embodiment of the present invention.  A designset is linked to one layoutset.  From one layoutset, there are
many layouts.  Each one of those layouts is then used to build one design for said designset.  For example, if a layout set has 100 layouts, then a designset built from it will have 100 designs.  A layoutset 650 gives rise to a layout 654, which itself
gives rise to a design 656.  The design 656 inherits from both a layout 654, and indirectly its layoutset 650.  The design 656 is also selected from a designset 652.  Each design 656 specifies a style and formatting of content in a layout 654 from which
it depends, while each layout 654 specifies a location of photo slots and/or text slots without reference to styling.  Each designset 652 is always tied to a layoutset 650 through its layout 654.  Finally, the design 656 gives rise to a canvas 658
through an addition of content by a user, automatically by the server, or both.  This inter-relationship of a canvas, a design, and a layout ensures system flexibility and efficiency whenever designs have to be modified.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6B illustrates a diagram 600 showing an inter-relationship of a theme, a layout, and a design, as well as their corresponding sets.  To repeat, a designset is linked to one layoutset.  From one layoutset, there are many layouts.  Each one
of those layouts is then used to build one design for said designset.  For example, if a layoutset has 100 layouts, then a designset built from it will have 100 designs.  As described previously, a user selects images to upload and build a photobook. 
Once the images are selected and upload begins, the user can select a theme 616.  The theme 616 corresponds to designsets 614 and 618.  Each designset is a collection of designs.  For example, the designset 614 comprises designs 608, 610, and 612. 
Similarly, the designset 618 comprises designs 620, 622, and another design not numbered.  Each design in turn depends on a layout.  For example, the design 608 depends on a layout 604.  Each layout depends on a layoutset.  For example, the layout 604
depends on a layoutset 602.  A layout can give rise to many designs.  For example, layout 606 can give rise to designs 620, 622, and another design (not numbered).  A design, in turn, may be presented in a canvas.  A canvas represents how a design will
be printed on paper.  Finally, a project 624 can be represented by a plurality of one or more canvases, such as canvas 626 and canvas 628 in this example.  For instance, the design 622 is reflected on canvas 628.  Each layoutset serves as a basis for
many designsets, and each layout serves as a basis for many designs.  A theme 616 is consistent with a plurality of layouts as well as a plurality of designs that depend from the layouts, thereby maintaining an inter-relationship between a theme, a
layout, and a design.  Thus, this inter-relationship offers greater control for a responsive design update and for auto-flow/auto-fill algorithms, thereby saving time and labor in creating a photobook.
<br/><br/>Other Exemplary Embodiments of the Present Invention
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is an exemplary screenshot of an editing interface 700 displaying a photo-spread including a front cover, back cover, and spine according to an embodiment of the present invention.  Interface 700 has a storyboard display 701 that includes
all of the pages of the photo book being created.  The inventors provide a unique paradigm for relating items across multiple pages including special pages, in this case, the front cover 703, the back cover 704, and the spine of the book 705.  When a
user edits a spread that contains more than one page, the photos, shapes and stickers can be "overflowed" from one page to other pages within the spread.  When the items are overflowing, they are linked together such that when an item changes on one
page, its linked item gets updated reflectively on the other page.
<br/><br/> In this example the related item is a single landscape photo 702 that is spread or wrapped around three special pages namely, front cover 703, back cover 704, and the spine 705.  In the case of photo 702, it actively occupies all three
designated special pages and editing of the photo from any of the special pages results in changes to the photo appearing on all three pages.  For example, if a user pans photo 702 the results of positional change are seen on all of the pages that the
photo occupies.  If each of the pages has one or more related items that appear on all of the pages for example, and editing performed on one of the related items may be propagated to all of the related items on other pages automatically.  The area 706
is an area in the interface that offers available resources for customizations, such as, stickers, shapes, and the like.
<br/><br/> Related items may also be moved over to one page completely, so that original item is not showing whatsoever on the other page.  When this occurs, the item will be removed from the page it is no longer visible on.  In one embodiment a user may
take an item that exists on a last page, for example, and may "sweep" the item off of that page to automatically create a next page with the same layout and theme that is hosting the related item.
<br/><br/> In one aspect of the present invention, a page's position may be reflected using signed integers, which may also be used to model a special pattern.  In this example, signed integers are used to describe positioning of the front cover 703
(signed integer -1) and back cover 704 (signed integer -2).  Other special pages like foldable poster spreads (within a book) and inside cover jackets may also be positioned using signed integers.  There may be a number of different position types to
consider including number (any position value &gt;0), special position, group position, pattern opposition, and function position.
<br/><br/> It is duly noted herein that every product available to create at the service site like books, cards, calendars, and photo books, is a compilation of pages.  A page is the fundamental canvas unit observed by the service although other unit
definitions may be observed.  A book is a collection of many pages.  "Pages" is not just a reference to the insides of a book, but it can also refer to the cover pieces.  The front cover, spine, and back cover are each pages which can be stitched
together.
<br/><br/> Many times in the process of creating a project, it makes sense to associate certain pages together.  When a user edits a foldable card, for example, the user may want to be able to move an item from the bottom portion to the top part of the
card.  From the perspective of the back end data, the foldable card comprises two different canvas units pieced together.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 is a block diagram illustrating an asset recommendation system according to an embodiment of the present invention.  In one embodiment of the present invention, asset recommendations are made to a user who is editing a current project
using the MIXBOOK collage editor.  System architecture 800 includes a user 801 that is currently online with runtime server 804 running an asset recommendation engine (ARE) 805.  The system of the invention has access to all of the assets that have been
designed by system designers, users whom may be registered as asset contributors, and any other user contributions to the system.  Creative assets 803 include all of the stickers, shapes, backgrounds, layouts, photos, and any other accessible imagery.
<br/><br/> When a user edits a project, and selects a theme, theme-based assets become accessible to that user's MIXBOOK editor.  In the canvas-editing interface (MBE), one can create a hierarchical recommendation system for presenting users with content
to use in their current and future projects.  By using themes as the building blocks for this hierarchal asset recommendation system, we can then link a theme to a project and utilize the creative content of the project as the basis for the theme.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a project can be used by the system as a basis for theme creation in order to facilitate creation of more projects based on the theme.  This theme creation process can be leveraged by bundling all forms of creative assets from
a user-created project into a theme.  If the creator of the project so chooses, all of the assets in the project can serve as the basis for a theme, which then serves as the creative basis for creating future projects.  For example, if a user creates a
"Mother's Day" project in the form of a photo book, they can use this project as the basis for a theme called "Mother's Day Theme." This "Mother's Day Theme" can then serve as the basis for users across the site to create their own "Mother's Day"
projects.  They will be able to utilize the canvas pages and all other creative assets that were added to the original "Mother's Day" project that was used to create the theme.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the assets are related to a specific theme a user has selected for a project.  Creative assets like backgrounds stickers, layouts, and so on appear in the interface as thumbnails along with the user's photos, etc. In one
embodiment asset recommendation engine 805 is adapted to list recommendations by relativity.  For example, if a user like user 801 is working a project that is baby themed, then the stickers relating to that theme would appear in the user's editing
interface.  For example, hierarchical recommendation may take the form of sticker categories 806.  Categories 806 include "My Stickers" as the top level of stickers (the first to appear in the interface).  "My stickers" would include the stickers added
directly to the project by contributors to the project.  "Theme stickers" would next appear and would include the system-provided theme stickers that go with that particular theme.  "Recommended Stickers" may include other theme stickers used in the
projects from the themes that this project's theme shares a theme category with (Baby Themes).
<br/><br/> Creative assets may be recommended on a contextual basis as well.  For example, if a user is editing a specific page that has baby stickers on it and clicks the sticker tab other baby stickers will be shown to the user, including the ones used
on that page.  Other recommendation schemas may be practiced in accordance with the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
<br/><br/> A cloud labeled All Users 802 may represent all of the users currently editing projects, or all of the users registered with the system.  Assets may be recommended to user 801 based on what all of the current users or based on what all of the
users have determined to be the best or most used or most popular assets like theme-based stickers.  If the asset is stickers, a recommendation might be the most popular stickers based on use count among all users.  Another category might be the most
popular stickers based on use count of only the friends of the user receiving the recommendation.  Another category might be recommendation of the stickers that might best fit a specific project (contextual).  Yet another category might be a
recommendation of creative assets based on bandwidth considerations.  There are many varied possibilities.  Any type of creative asset might be considered for recommendation using contextual or hierarchical recommendation using ARE 805.  Recommendations
may be made to users according to analyzed usage counts, friend relationships among the content creators, and content characteristics like width and heights or content meta-data such as photo data.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a single asset recommendation system analogous to ARE 805 is provided for recommending creative assets stored by the system to users editing a project or a project page.  Assets may include but are not limited to the
categories of stickers, shapes, backgrounds, layouts, and frames.  In a preferred embodiment the asset recommendation system is implemented in software and integrated with the GUI for recommending creative assets.  In one embodiment the asset
recommendation engine is a back-end data process that works in the background to rank creative assets and serve relevant assets according to ranking order.  In this case each creative asset considered has a score card that may reflect a final score or
value based on one or more conditions or "weightings."
<br/><br/> The system is adapted to receive server calls relative to user GUI activity and to parse information about creative assets stored for use.  A ranking function is provided that ranks creative assets based on filtered and/or or unfiltered
statistical data known about usage and characteristics of the asset input against one or more pre-set rules for ranking the appeal of that asset.  The system includes a server function for serving the recommended assets into the GUI.  In this way the
most relevant assets may appear in the interface closer to the top followed by the lower ranked assets and so on per asset category.  The process is driven by algorithm and may fire each time the user clicks on an asset category to browse available
creative assets stored by the system of the invention.
<br/><br/> Both hierarchical and contextual recommendations can be made in concert to users operating the GUI.  When a user clicks on an existing project to resume editing, the project's creative assets are loaded into the project pages as described
further above.  These creative assets are also listed in hierarchical order in the asset selection interface, typically the sidebar area of the editing GUI.  In one aspect the hierarchy is My Stickers, followed by Theme Stickers, followed by Recommended
Stickers.  The ranking portion of the engine ranks My Stickers or "Project Stickers" as being most relevant to the project because they are already established in the project by the project contributors.  Therefore, these already used stickers will be
stickers that have the greatest probability of being re-used in the project.
<br/><br/> The ranking engine ranks theme stickers as the next level of importance because these stickers are designed to be used in the theme that the user's project falls under.  Now, the ranking engine looks at stickers that are stored that have been
used in other user-created projects sharing the same theme or belonging to the same theme category but that have not yet been used in the instant project.  The system ranks these stickers according to a weighting algorithm that calculates the appeal of
each qualifying sticker according to one or a combination of parameter constraints.
<br/><br/> In one example, the recommended stickers sent to a user for display in the recommended stickers' window might be the highest ranking stickers based on a use statistic filtered by user type.  For example, this user's friends prefer the following
recommended stickers based on the number of times they have been used in projects sharing the same theme or even the same theme category.  On the other hand, the system may rank the stickers based on some other preset condition that is relevant to the
situation at hand or may rank stickers based on likeness to stickers already selected for use in a project or on a project page.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment the asset recommendation requirements are a receiving function for receiving server calls relative to user GUI activity being monitored, a weighting function for ranking creative assets based on input against one or more rules
for ranking asset appeal, and a server function for serving the recommended assets into a GUI.  In simple practice of the invention includes (a) receiving an indication of a user selection of a project or project page for edit at an asset recommendation
engine; (b) calculating or updating current scores for the assets that qualify for service based on project, project page, and theme-based characteristics; and (c) serving the assets into the GUI asset browsing windows with the most relevant assets based
on analyzed score served first followed by lesser relevant assets.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the system of the present invention can select one or more photos from a user's project for recommendation in a new product.  The system stores the in-depth page positioning information for all of the items placed in a user's
project.  The metadata about each of the user's photos, for example, is persisted along with the in-depth positioning information with each item stored for use in the project.
<br/><br/> The system may therefore make intelligent recommendations regarding the importance and relevance of photos and other assets to a user.  Through this analysis, the system can make automated suggestions of single or multiple photo products that
the user may have an interest in purchasing.
<br/><br/> By analyzing asset usage information and other data the system can access the items stored for a specific project that may contain, for example, hundreds of photos and select one photo or a few photos that would qualify for application to single
or multi-photo products like canvas prints, coffee mugs or mouse pads and so on.
<br/><br/> Referring now back to FIG. 8, the system may use ARE 805 to make an assessment of which image or photo assets in a product are good candidates for isolation for a single or multi-photo product.  The term multi-photo refers to a product with two
to several photos, for example, where the user had many photos in the project pool.  A coffee mug may include a photo wrapped around the mug or several photos positioned about the mug.  There are many different possibilities.
<br/><br/> The ARE may first access the creator's project photos stored in the database.  Then the system might weigh data associated with each photo used in the project against one or more business rules.  After weighing the results, ARE 805 may select
one or more than one photo based on weighted score.  In one aspect each item has a score card.  The system may finally suggest or recommend one or more than one photo product as an up sell at such time the user wishes to make a purchase.  A unique aspect
of the recommendation is that the system may present one or more views of the suggested product already loaded with the creator's photos selected by the system.
<br/><br/> ARE 805 analyzes any tags attributed to photos and the descriptions of and captions associated with those photos.  ARE 805 might consider the actual size of images for certain product types like canvas prints, for example.  If a photo is a
background that spans two pages in a photo book, it may be a good candidate for a canvas print.  ARE 805 can consider the number of times a photo is used in the same project.  The recommendation may be updated as a user edits a project such that when a
user is ready to purchase the project in print form the system might also recommend that the user purchase another product that can be displayed to the user through the GUI with the recommended photos in place on the product.  The system might offer an
up sell option of one or more than one product exhibiting the selected photos.
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 8, ARE 805 may leverage a number of statistical genres to help prioritize creative assets that are presented to customers for possible inclusion into their projects.  Network 800 supports a statistics server 808. 
Statistics server 808 includes at least one processor, data repository, and a transitory medium.  Server 808 hosts SW 809, labeled Activity Monitor.  Activity monitor 809 may be hosted on runtime server 804 and may be integrated with ARE 805 without
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
<br/><br/> ARE 805 may also communicate with a separate activity monitor 809 as shown in this example distributed to server 808 to better aid discussion of separate functions.  Activity monitor 809 is adapted to monitor activities of customers and
non-registered site visitors for the purpose of gathering data to create useable statistics across multiple categories relative to the activities of customers and, in some embodiments, relative to the activities of non-service-registered friends and
family members of those customers who may visit the site to look at projects or otherwise browse published projects created by those customers.  Activity monitor 809 may monitor all of the activity occurring within the service domain, such as at the
service Website (not illustrated), and during project creation, editing, and transaction processes through a graphics user interface (GUI).
<br/><br/> Server 808 has connection to a data repository 810 adapted to contain, at least, client navigation and usage statistics.  In one embodiment navigation and usage statistics may be gathered from non-registered users such as friends and family of
registered users who visit the service domain such as a Website, portal, social interaction page, project publication page, and so on.  Activity monitor 809, in this embodiment, works in the background independently from ARE 805 to monitor all users and
to collect data about those users and activities they engage in at the service site domain.  Activity monitor 809 includes a processing component for creating statistics formulated under several categories.  One such category is usage of assets such as
repetitively used content contributions, themes, stickers, frames, styles, etc. Another possible category of data relates to a user actively liking or disliking an asset or contribution.  Site navigation patterns of users through the service domain
represent another possible category for gathering data and forming statistics.  Still another data category is sales data relative to projects created at the service, for example, the current best-selling themes.
<br/><br/> Activity monitor 809 creates statistical information about data it has collected and store the information in data repository 810.  As activity monitor 809 creates new statistics, the data in repository 810 is updated and older data that is
obsolete under any category may be purged.  A time window for keeping data may be imposed as some categories may fluctuate widely in the amount of and relevancy of statistics depending on season, trend factors, or other like factors of change.  For
example, the theme "Mothers Day" and related creative assets and usage statistics would not be relevant during the time just before "Fathers Day", but become relevant again around the next "Mother's Day" season.
<br/><br/> In prioritizing creative assets, the system, which may leverage ARE 805, attempts to present to the customer the best-fit assets the system can offer for what the customer's goals are in the way of project creation.  ARE 805 may run for each
user who is actively creating and or editing a project.  In one embodiment, ARE 805 may communicate with a customer, making pre-project recommendations before the customer initiates a project if there is some indication of the intent of the customer. 
When ARE 805 is called to recommend assets to a user, it may access data repository 810 to obtain statistics relative to a theme, theme category, layout, and associated individual assets like stickers, photos, etc. that may be presented in prioritized
fashion for that user.  If the best, most likely accepted items are presented to the user first, less work will be required of the user to create a project.
<br/><br/> The system may determine, for example, which existing template would be best for the user by looking at statistics formed from sales data and numerical analysis.  In one example, assume that there are two photos arranged on a user's page for
remixing.  A category for data gathering could be data about history of all purchased books having layouts with 2 landscape photos arranged on them.  Candidate layouts then may be prioritized further to narrow the field down to a few layouts that would
best serve the customer.  Template or layout categories may be filtered further by narrowing the selection criteria based on related themes to the current project being worked on.
<br/><br/> Prioritized assets may be presented to a user in a sidebar of the graphics user interface.  Activity monitor 809 includes at least a function for assessing and recording the usage statistics of digital assets used by the overall client base. 
Activity monitor 809 also includes a function for monitoring and recording the navigation behaviors, usage patterns, and content contributions of all or individual ones of users operating through the at least one GUI or visiting the service domain.  ARE
805 functions to gather the prioritized digital assets for presentation according to analysis of statistical data recorded by activity monitor 809.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a layout fabrication engine (LFE) 811 is provided to run on RS 804.  LFE 811 is adapted to dynamically create or remix the layout of a canvas based on input from asset recommendation engine 805.  In this way, a user may see
the recommended assets and a preview of what the layout will look like using the highest prioritized assets like background, photos, stickers, frames for photo slots, text box styles, and other items.  One component of such an engine is a machine
learning routine that learns from a library of prioritized assets including photos, stickers, and other prioritized assets and is adapted to study page layouts containing these assets.  The routine aids layout fabrication by providing intelligence
relative to how best to position those assets such as photos, for example, and how best to compliment those assets with other assets like stickers.  One example of such an optimization is mining metadata from prioritized assets like photos to create
relevant captions for those photos.  In one embodiment, location data and time data might be leveraged to provide a relevant caption for a photo, for example, if a photo is taken in New York City at 12:00 PM, then a relevant caption might be "New York
City at night", or "Midnight in New York City".
<br/><br/> The system, in some embodiments, includes a physics simulation engine 807 for simulating motion dynamics for items placed in a canvas layout.
<br/><br/> Finally, FIG. 9 is an architectural diagram illustrating a printing network 900 according to an embodiment of the present invention.  Printing network 900 includes a user 901 connected online to a runtime server 902.  Runtime server 902 is
analogous to runtime servers previously described in this specification.  Runtime server 902 includes a digital medium coupled thereto and adapted to contain all of the SW and data required to enable server function.
<br/><br/> When user 901 is editing a project using a MIXBOOK editor (MBE) such as MBE 906, for example, the user is connected in session with server 902.  As such, the user may decide to print a finished project such as a photo book by invoking a printing
option such as print project option 908 illustrated in exploded view.  Such an action invokes a printing engine 907 that is responsible for rendering the user's project in a ready state for printing according to a final end product selected by the user.
<br/><br/> The printing engine sends output files for printing to a third-party printing service 903.  Printing service 903 represents any online printing service.  Third-party printer 903 includes a printing server 904 and a connected printer 905
representing printing capability.  Printing engine 907 is a flash based that is enhanced to produce high resolution output files to print.  Print engine 907 is a single print engine that is involved from the point of creating a project to the point of
printing out the project.
<br/><br/> A flash-based print engine has some drawbacks that need to be overcome in order to print larger high resolution files.  Outputting large format prints for printing from a flash based editor is very difficult to do.  The inventors provide
enhancements that enable the system to take flash content and produce a near pixel-perfect reproduction of a user's work in the high resolution formats that professional printers normally require.  Traditionally print systems take the back end data and
then recreate the content for printing through a second engine such as a Java-based print engine or a C-application.  Print engine 907 is a point for point engine and can re-create content at any dots per inch (DPI) required by the printer.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, gutter areas of printed products are optimized for view after print.  In most situations, a traditional printed book having a gutter area will have content sucked into the gutter area where it is hard to view, or there will be
a color strip applied to the gutter area whereby the color strip appears somewhat unprofessional.  Print engine 907 functions to solve the above problems by optimizing the size of the gutter area and content displayed on a page before printing.  In
particular, the system of the invention implements a unique method of gutter size calculation and content display logic for printable products.
<br/><br/> Based on other content optimization algorithmic results, a gutter calculation algorithm calculates the best size for the gutter based in part on the aspect ratio grouping.  The gutter area is intelligently sized in order to minimize the amount
of content that is not viewable on printed book products due to the glue that lies in the gutter between two pages on a given spread.
<br/><br/> The gutter sizing algorithm works in conjunction with a content sizing algorithm to balance the two extremes, one being no gutter allowance, and the other being too much gutter allowance.  No gutter allowance results in content hidden by the
glued area in between pages.  Too much allowance causes the area defined as gutter to be displayed visibly to the user.
<br/><br/>Page and Spread Re-Arrangement Embodiments
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 is an embodiment 1000 showing a printable photobook with a cover in a finished form.  In an editing interface or workspace or editor (GUI) 1002, a photobook is displayed with a cover or cover page 1004.  The cover may be a hard cover
with a random or organized selection of some of the photos contained in the photobook.  A user can select (add or delete) one or more photos from the cover.  The totality of photos in the photo book may be displayed to the user to customize the cover. 
In customizing the cover, the user can select a photo 1006 and add the selected photo 1006 to the cover page 1004, by dragging and dropping.  After the user is satisfied with the design of the cover, the user can click on the soft button "Arrange Pages"
1008 to customize each page or each spread one by one.  Other methods to add photos to the cover and to the photobook are also within the scope of the present invention.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 is an embodiment 1100 displaying pages or spreads of a photobook.  A first spread 1104 comprising photos and a second spread 1106 comprising photos is shown.  The display of the embodiment 1100 or the arrangement of spreads as shown may
be termed as a grid preview.  A soft "save" button 1110 saves the arranged or customized pages and spreads as a soft copy of the entire project.  Unused photos or an entire spread may be saved in a photo storage area 1108.  The user can add additional
photos to the photo editing area by pressing a soft button "Add More Photos" 1112, which takes the user to a location in which additional photos may be uploaded.  Once the additional photos are added to the photo editing area, the user can press a soft
button "Arrange Pages" 1102 to initiate an arrangement of pages and/or spreads with the additional photos, returning the user to this screen 1100.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 is an embodiment 1200 showing a dragging of a spread.  Two opposing pages can be referred to as a spread, and hence, the terms "pages" and "spread" may be used interchangeably, if the context requires it.  A spread 1202 is dragged by
using an input device of a computer, such as, a mouse, finger, stylus, and the like.  The dragged spread 1202 is brought close to an adjacent spread 1204.  The dragged spread 1202 is movable anywhere in the photo editor or workspace.  The dragged spread
1202 may be dropped in between any other two spreads, or before the adjacent first spread 1204, or even after a last spread.  The dragged spread 1202 may also be dropped in the temporary storage area 1204.  A spread or a photo that is stored in the
storage area 1204 may be used anytime later in the photobook customization process.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 is an embodiment 1300 showing a swap of two adjacent spreads in a photobook.  A swap of two adjacent spreads causes the location of the two spreads to switch.  If the two spreads are not adjacent, then dropping the actively moved spread
causes the other spreads to re-arrange.  In the embodiment 1200, it is shown how one spread is movable in the photo editing area.  In the embodiment 1300, it is shown how two spreads switch their locations after a swap.  A swap is performed by dragging
and dropping one spread adjacent to another spread.  In the embodiment 1100, the spreads 1104 and 1106 are in original or auto-generated locations.  In the embodiment 1200, the spread 1202 is being dragged.  In the embodiment 1300, the spread 1302 is
dropped before the spread 1304.  Therefore, the embodiments 1100, 1200 and 1300, show how two spreads are swapped, or within the same meaning, how the locations of two spreads are swapped or moved or reshuffled.  The user has an option to add more photos
in the photo storage area or the editor by clicking on a soft button "Add More Photos" 1310.  The project can be saved for later retrieval by clicking on the soft button "Save" 1308.  An unused photo 1306 is stored in a photo storage area.  The photo
storage area can be anywhere in the editor or workspace, as a matter of design choice.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 is an embodiment 1400 showing a pre-movement of a photo from one spread to another spread.  A user desires to move a photo 1406 from a first spread 1402 to a second spread 1404.  The photo 1406 is movable by a drag of a mouse, a finger,
a stylus, and the like.  When the photo 1406 is moved, a placeholder (gap) 1408 is shown in the form of a shade to indicate where the photo 1406 was previously occupied.  If the photo 1406 is not correctly dropped to a different location, the photo 1406
will automatically drop to its initial placeholder 1408, with no change in the location of the photo 1406 after a post-drag.  In the embodiment 1400, the photo 1406 is dragged, by detaching the photo 1406 from the spread 1402, with the intention to merge
the photo 1406 to the spread 1404.
<br/><br/> FIG. 15 is an embodiment 1500 showing a post-movement of a photo from one spread to anther spread.  A photo 1506 is moved from a spread 1502 to a spread 1504.  A pre-movement is shown by the embodiment 1400.  The photo 1506 displays a
post-movement of the same picture from the spread 1502 to the spread 1504.
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 is an embodiment 1600 showing a new spread pre-creation by detaching a photo from an existing spread.  A photo 1606 is dragged from a spread 1602, and the dragged photo 1606 is dragged to middle of the spread 1602 and an adjacent spread
1604.  After the photo 1606 is detached from the spread 1602 by dragging, a placeholder 1608 is displayed at the spread 1602 to indicate the original location (placeholder or gap) of the photo 1606.
<br/><br/> FIG. 17 is an embodiment 1700 showing a new spread in-creation by detaching a photo from an existing spread.  When a photo 1706 is about to be dropped between a spread 1702 and a spread 1704, an indication of a new spread creation is shown by a
display of a new placeholder 1708.  The old placeholder 1710 of the photo 1706 is displayed until the photo 1706 is actually dropped or released to the new placeholder 1708.  The new placeholder 1708 is also a placeholder for a new spread.  After the
photo 1706 is dropped to the new placeholder 1708, the old placeholder 1710 disappears.
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 is an embodiment 1800 showing a new spread post-creation by detaching a photo from an existing spread.  A photo 1806 is now on its own, newly-created spread, meaning a new spread having the one photo that was previously detached from an
existing spread.  When the photo 1806 is dropped between two spreads 1802 and 1804, creating now the new spread 1806 with a single photo, the adjacent spreads 1802 and 1804 will shift to the left or right, as appropriate, to adjust and accommodate a
space for the new spread 1806 between the original spreads 1802 and 1804.
<br/><br/>Undo and Redo Embodiments
<br/><br/> FIG. 19 is an embodiment 1900 showing a functionality of a reverse or UNDO feature, according to one embodiment of the present invention.  The UNDO feature reverses an altered design to a previous design.  The previous design may be a default
design or a previously saved design.  A default design may be a pre-set design that is prepared by a computer algorithm of the present invention, for example, a use case or image heuristics.  In the embodiment 1900, step 1902 starts an implementation
process of UNDO or reversal function.  At step 1904, a previous design of a first view is shown to a user at an editor.  At step 1906, the user edits or alters the existing design of the first view and converts the first view to a new design.  The new
design may comprise changes in layout, theme, size and location of media files or photos within the view.  After a new design is implemented in the first view, at step 1908, the user flips or turns a page to a second view for editing the second view.  At
step 1910, the first view is auto-saved by saving the changes or alterations made by the user.  While the editor is on the second view, at step 1912, the user clicks "UNDO" soft button on the second view.  The "UNDO" soft button may or may not have
alphabetic characters, and may comprise just a symbol or arrow to connote UNDO.  At step 1914, after clicking the "UNDO" soft button for a first time, the editor exits from the second view and lands on the first view.  On the first view, there is also an
"UNDO" soft button, as displayed at the editor.  At step 1916, the user clicks "UNDO" button again on the first view.  After a second click, meaning after a total of two cumulative clicks, at step 1918, the first view reverts to the previous design, the
previous design as shown in step 1904.  The process ends at step 1920, thus, completing a reversal function of edit by performing two clicks of the UNDO button.
<br/><br/> In other embodiments, a total of three cumulative clicks may be implemented for the reversal function of the present invention.  The additional third click may be used as a confirmation click before exiting from the second view and landing on
the first view.  A confirmation click may ask the user to click the "UNDO" button one more time.  Here, "click" may refer to "undo" or any type of reversal initiation process that is initiated by a computer mouse or digital pen.  A computer mouse is one
illustrative type of input method, which can also be replaced by a touch gesture of a touchscreen monitor, or even keystroke.
<br/><br/> FIG. 20 is a screenshot embodiment 2000 showing a previously made view (or design of a spread) of a photobook, as displayed on the editor.  A previously made design 2002 (a design of a spread) comprises a plurality of photos, in which a photo
2004 is grouped with other photos.  The photo 2004 and other photos in the group as shown may be grouped together in accordance to a use case or image heuristics.  The layout of the group, meaning a group of photos as shown, can be changed by clicking
"Change Layout" soft button 2006.  A layout change may alter size, position, and focus (zoom) of any or all photos.  Furthermore, a user can manually alter a layout, thereby, over-riding automatic layout change.  This manual over-ride may be called
manual customization.  The user may take the editor to a next view by clicking a forward arrow 2008.  The user can also take the editor to a previous view (if any) or a cover page by clicking a backward arrow 2010.  In the design of a view 2002, a user
can use a REDO arrow 2012 to "undo" the "UNDO" of the view.  This REDO recapture may be explained in others words as, "oops, I changed my mind about the UNDO, and I want the most recent UNDO canceled."
<br/><br/> FIG. 21 is a screenshot embodiment 2100 showing a changing layout or changing design of a view in a photobook, as displayed on the editor.  A design 2102 of a spread comprises a picture 2104 and other pictures as shown.  The photo 2104 of
embodiment 2100 corresponds to the photo 2004 of the embodiment 2000, showing how a layout change also changes size and position of a same picture.  By pressing or clicking an UNDO arrow 2106, the present invention will revert the embodiment 2100 to the
embodiment 2000.  This reversal of layout or design in a view is when the user is working on the same view, without exiting from the view.  While a user is working on the same view, a single click of UNDO will reverse all past changes, edits, or
customizations.  The UNDO feature may be explained in other words as, "I do not like this newly made design, and I want my old design back."
<br/><br/> FIG. 22 is a screenshot embodiment 2200 as shown after the user exits from the embodiment 2100 by clicking a forward arrow button on the embodiment 2100, and thereby, landing on the embodiment 2200, or otherwise navigates to another view of the
project.  While the editor displays the embodiment 2200, the user can click on the undo button 2206 to exit from the embodiment 2200 and to land on the embodiment 2100.  Upon exiting from the embodiment 2200 and with a subsequent press of the UNDO button
at the embodiment 2100, the editor will revert the embodiment 2100 to the embodiment 2000.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the functionality of UNDO can be applied to computer program code (software) whenever there are multiple views of a project.  These multiple views comprise pages, spreads, and even three-dimensional (3D) views.  A first
click of UNDO moves the editor to a previous view before actually doing the undo, or before actually reverting to a previously unaltered state of design.  For example, the present invention can be applied to a 3D editing software to change views from one
view of a 3D object to another view of the 3D object.
<br/><br/> Embodiments 1900 to 2200 can be applied to views of a spread in a photobook as well as views of a three dimensional (3D) object in a three dimensional (3D) editing interface, or for other applications and use cases.  In the case of a 3D editing
interface, the first undo would first switch the user back to a previous view of the 3D editing interface that displays the last edit performed by the user, and the user would be required to click UNDO a second time to confirm the UNDO and perform the
reverse operation.  Other examples and use cases of the invention are also possible, and would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from this disclosure.  Any application which has multiple views could benefit from this invention.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the user can repeatedly click on the UNDO button, and the editor will reverse each layout or design change of a view.  If there is nothing left to UNDO or alter on the same view, now with a subsequent UNDO press, the
editor will exit from the view and will land on previously edited view, and with each subsequent UNDO press, the editor will reverse layout or design changes on that previous view until there is no more view or alteration left to UNDO.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the UNDO feature will cause each finitely altered design or altered layout to finitely revert to a previous design or layout, either within a same view or a previous view, first by automatically switching design or layout
within the same view, and second by exiting from the view and landing on to a previous view.  Conversely, a REDO button will recapture each alteration that were reverted by UNDO button.
<br/><br/> Although specific arrangements and specific movements were described in relation to the figures, it should be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that these specific movements are merely illustrative, and examples of embodiments in
which the present invention may be implemented, and are not intended to be exhaustive or limiting the manner in which the invention may be implemented.  The photos, pages, and spreads may be moved about in various combinations, sub-combinations, orders,
sequences, sub-sequences, and so on.  One of ordinary skill will recognize that various combinations of movements, which are illustrated here, would be within the scope of the inventive embodiments.
<br/><br/>Other Exemplary Embodiments for Illustrative Purposes
<br/><br/> The language in the examples or elaborations below are context-specific embodiments, and should not be construed to limit the broader spirit of the present invention.
<br/><br/> To help a user in creating a photo book, the present invention automatically inserts content into an automatically selected design for the user.  Automatic insertion of content greatly helps in auto-flow/auto-fill algorithms and in design
updates, without a need to re-start designing a book from scratch each time when a user wants to update to a new design.  Content refer to photos, text and inputs from the user (user inputs, user interactions, behavioral observations, etc.).
<br/><br/> Content is analyzed along with a selected layout and a selected design of a book.  Content analysis uses (A) image information automatically derived by the system ("automatic image information"); and (B) image information derived though user's
interactions or behavioral observations ("observed image information"), as discussed in greater detail below.  Based on the information from (A) and (B), the system performs: (C) automatic photo grouping; and (D) automatic content insertion into designs.
<br/><br/> A) Automatic Image Information (Image Information Derived by the System)
<br/><br/> A.1) Photos
<br/><br/> For photos, the invention will analyze images to determine:
<br/><br/> Saliency: Saliency is a most relevant part of an image as determined by image analysis or user's behavioral observations.  By using saliency detection, the invention can store the areas of the photo that are of interest.  These areas can utilize
progressive reduction algorithm for saliency boxes.  A saliency box is calculated by generating a saliency map, and searching an area that has a highest interest score.  A searching box is adaptive.  When a saliency area is small relative to a photo, the
system relaxes the threshold to allow more contents in the area.  When the saliency is large, the threshold is more strict.  Face: By using face detection, the system recognizes where faces are situated in a photo.  Computer Vision Analysis: The system
applies image analysis to detect qualities of photos; the qualities include, such as, darkness, blurriness, colorfulness, simplicity, brightness, contrast, balance of light intensity over a photo, and harmony of color interaction.  Photo Similarities:
Visual similarity of a photo relative to other photos.  Photo Information: This includes file name of a photo, dimensions (width and height), time of photo capture, make and model of the camera used in photography, aperture, shutter speed, exposure
compensation, ISO, flash, focal length, and GPS location.  A.2) Text For text, the system looks at: Text Metrics: The system calculates space occupied by text in a textbox area.  This includes width and height of the text at a given size.  This way, the
system can position the text with no cutoff by adjusting text size and other factors, such as, font.  Captions for photos: Captions can be provided with photos, either through an API or other format.  Captions can be mined through image analysis and
computer vision.  For example, the system can run photos in a design page through an analyzer that predicts that a photo bears the Eiffel Tower, and puts a label "Eiffel Tower" alongside the photo on the page.
<br/><br/>B) Observed Image Information (Information Derived Through User's Interactions)
<br/><br/> As a user interacts with selected photos in a design, the invention monitors the behavior of the user and learns about the content through the user's actions on photos.  Here are some ways the invention learns the user's interests: Photo Areas
of Interest: By tracking the users' zooming and panning behavior, the invention can understand what areas of photos are more important over the computer vision algorithms that the present invention may use.  For example, if the user takes a photo that is
400.times.300 pixels in size and pans/zooms the photo in a photo slot so that the bottom left quarter of the photo is showing in the photo slot, the invention learns that the bottom left 200.times.150 of the image holds importance to the user.  The
invention can further subtract off a buffer adjustment to the resulting subsection of the photo.  By subtracting away from the resulting 200.times.150 part of the photo, the invention can make a best guess of an actual area of interest of the photo. 
This buffer adjustment can be calculated in the same way as when the invention seeks to add a buffer adjustment on top of the area of interest of a photo.  Photo Importance: If a user swaps photos on a page, the invention can use this information to
understand photo importance/hierarchy on a design page.
<br/><br/>C) Automatic Photo Grouping
<br/><br/> Once photos are selected, the invention automatically arranges the photos into pages/spreads.  If photos are more related to each other, they are more likely to be grouped together.
<br/><br/> C.1) Multidimensional Grouping
<br/><br/> For photos to be related to each other in a photo set, they may have to be either taken at a close time-range, or appear to be similar.  The invention checks photo's timestamps and measures similarities between photo pairs to decide if photos
should belong to a same page/spread or not.  Timestamps: Most of the modern cameras provide timestamp information.  When photos are taken in an event, they are naturally close to each other by time.  The invention applies algorithms to cluster the photos
together by timestamps, and thus separate the photos into logical events.  Similarity: Timestamps alone may not always produce best results for grouping.  The invention further groups photos by image similarities to place related photos together in a
layout/design.  For example, a user can take different sceneries within a close time range.  By detecting similarities of photos, the invention can arrange the photos together by photo similarities or separate them into two groups of different sceneries. Multiple cameras: When family or group photos are taken by multiple cameras, their timestamps may not be accurately aligned.  For example, when people are traveling internationally, smartphone cameras are often automatically adjusted to a local time,
while regular cameras are not often auto-adjusted to the time change: this may create several hours of time difference between the two camera types.  The invention solves this misalignment in time difference: when multiple cameras are detected in a photo
set, correct orders of all included photos ordered correctly.  The invention assumes that a time offset is consistent for the photos from the same camera, and that different cameras may have different time offsets.  Photos are sorted by timestamps for
each camera.  The invention calculates a matching score as follows: for every photo, the invention searches nearby photos from a set of photos, and calculates photo similarities and time difference.  A higher matching score is obtained if photos are
similar and their timestamps are closer to each other.  Summation of all individual photo matching scores is a score of the sequence in which the photos may be grouped.  When all sequence scores are calculated, the invention picks the highest scored
sequence.  If the user has a third set of photos, the invention will repeat this process by treating the first two photo sets as already paired.  The same calculation is used when multiple cameras are involved.  Photos without timestamps: Timestamps can
be lost or not be available in some cases.  In such cases, the invention sorts photos by natural orders, such as filenames, or uploading orders.  Then, the invention progressively groups them by photo similarities until the photos form into book pages. 
The invention calculates similarity scores among all possible pairs of photos and then sorts these scores.  Highly similar photos are grouped together first.  The invention continues with the grouping process until a target group cluster numbers are
achieved.  During this process, the invention may need to evaluate similarities between two groups containing multiple photos.  Group similarity is an average of all possible similar pairs of photos in photo sets.  Photo importance: Best photos are
selected by its own group for highlighting purposes.  C.2) Aesthetic Rules for Grouping
<br/><br/> Photo grouping is designed to create a pleasant-looking spread.  Internet users like to focus on important photos in creating their books.  Embedded in computer algorithms, the invention allows most attractive photos to be as a single spread in
a group.  The invention also adjusts spread counts by a number of photos.  When there are fewer photos, the invention stretches the number of the groups to make the book appear having more pages.  When there are many photos, the invention compresses the
number of groups to not exceed the number of maximum pages available in a photobook.
<br/><br/>D) Automatic Insertion of Content into Designs
<br/><br/> Once content is accumulated from a server (automatic image information) and user's inputs (observed image information), the present invention utilizes a set of algorithms to lay the content onto a page.  The algorithm(s) will utilize the
following components described below:
<br/><br/> D.1) Photo Level Ranking
<br/><br/> By analyzing the information derived from a server (automatic image information) and user's inputs (observed image information), the invention determines how to place/position photos in a design so that a placement of the photos are in correct
spots, and are panned/zoomed to optimal locations.  Photos are scored with photo quality based on computer vision analysis.  Computer vision analysis may be facial recognition-related analysis or not related to facial recognition.  Some photo/image
heuristics that can be employed to calculate photo/image importance or image scores are: Using identity and count of faces in photos to increase or decrease importance of a photo: Face recognition is used to identify faces in different photos.  Each
unique face is grouped together.  Faces with higher frequency connote higher importance for that individual (subject) since they (faces) are more popular in a photo set.  In some cases, the invention recognizes faces and give extra importance to main
characters of a the photo set, i.e., a bride and a groom.  Reducing scores of photos for blurriness or undesirable traits (too dark or over exposed).  Using camera settings to determine the environment in which photos were taken.  Detecting artistic
photography techniques, such as, lens flare or motion blur.  Using photo brightness, contrast and other photo characteristics.  Using machine learning to recognize important/relevant objects in photos, such as cars, pets, houses, and similar things that
might indicate photo importance.  When a face is detected, face properties are evaluated.  For example, if a person's face is smiling, a photo score is higher.  Attributes, such as, size, position or clarity of a face affect a score of the photo.  The
invention combines attributes non-linearly to give a quality evaluation to a face.  A saliency box performs a target analysis on a photo.  For example, within a saliency box, if there is a face, more importance is given to the face as the face is within
the area of interest in the photo.  Scene detection, such as, landscape detection, mountain detection, indoor/outdoor detection, and naturalness or man-made detection can affect photo scores.  Using face detection related scoring, for example, when faces
are detected from a photo, the invention combines size, location, smile confidence, orientation, clarity, and exposure to determine a facial quality score.  Combing all relevant scores to generate a final photo quality score.  D.2) Buffer Calculations
for Best Fitting Content into Photo Boxes
<br/><br/> The invention can draw a box around important parts of a photo.  How a photo gets positioned inside a photo box can change based on the size of a relevant photo box that is available in a layout or design.  For example, when face detection and
saliency detection detect a person's face and body in a photo, the invention positions the photo at a photo box in a manner that the areas around the person's face and body are shown.  This would be a case if the photo slot is large and if there is more
real estate on a design page.  This is implemented by employing a buffer over/above the box where the invention determines an area of interest in the photo.
<br/><br/> In some cases, when a photo slot is as large as a page, the buffer around the area of importance of a photo may extend out to either a top, a bottom, a left, or a right edge of the photo.  If a photo slot is very small, the buffer around an area
of interest might be small or non-existent.
<br/><br/> D.3) Area of Interest in a Photo
<br/><br/> An area of interest in a photo is calculated by combining several computer vision processing techniques to build a box that includes all important parts of the photo (automatic image information), together with information from user interactions
(observed image information).  Computer vision processing techniques include, but are not limited to, face detection, face recognition, saliency detection (saliency boxes), user specified areas of interest, and so on.
<br/><br/> D.4) Scoring for Inserting Photos into Layouts
<br/><br/> A design contains multiple photo slots.  Each photo slot may be modeled as a rectangle or square.  The visible part of a rectangle is a focal box of a photo slot.  A photo is processed for saliency and face detection, and each detected area is
labeled and represented on the photo as a rectangle with a location on the photo.  For a photo slot to match a photo, the invention first zooms the photo so that the most of the saliency and face boxes are shown with a minimization of photo cut-off. 
Photo positioning with a photo slot is calculated at this step.  Positioning strives to minimize the area that is cropped.  If cropping is unavoidable, the area of interest is either centered to a saliency box, or best positioned to faces.  Face cropping
may be minimized to a smaller area.  A matching score is a combination of photo area cut-off, saliency area cut-off, and face area cut-off.  Each cut-off area has its own importance, where faces may have highest importance.  For each design to match a
set of photos, photo permutation is a factorial of a photo set size or a number of photo slots.  These calculations may be costly if there are many photos to match up with an equal number of photo slots.  The invention performs a depth first search with
limited branching to traverse possible matching patterns.  For each permutation of photos, the invention combines individual matching scores together to get a score related to permutation.  The depth search algorithm decides a best score selection and
thus generate a best fitting for this design set, and this score can also be used to compare a matching fit with other design sets.  D.5) Determining a Best Design for Contents
<br/><br/> In a case of an auto-flow algorithm, the invention may need to insert content derived from a user into design pages.  In order to this, below is an implementation of the heuristic: The invention selects designsets for a theme.  The invention
finds best possible designs from the designset that can fit with contents (photos and text).  Using ranking algorithms and other heuristics, the invention determines a best fitting design from the designset.  D.6) Dynamic Text Insertion Across Platforms
<br/><br/> Software clients render text differently than photos.  Text often behave differently when trying to create books that are editable across multiple software clients.  Text entered into a book through a browser might render as two lines of text. 
However, for example, when it is rendered on a specific user device, such as, a native APPLE IPAD client, text could show up in three or more lines.
<br/><br/> To alleviate this problem, when a user adds text to a page, the text is passed into a text processing engine that breaks it up into text lines.  Each text line contains a string of text, its coordinates and size on the page.  When the text is
rendered on a different client, the client is responsible for slightly compressing character spacing for any text that exceeds the size of the line.  By utilizing text metrics, the text to be inserted into textboxes on a design page will fit without
requiring the text to cut off.  The algorithm works as follows: The textbox has a default size.  Say, for example, size 16.  Check if the given text fits into the textbox, and check how it fits if it has to stretch to multiple lines.  If it does not fit,
decrease the text size and see if the text fits (with size 15).  If it still does not fit, decrease the size again until it fits.  If the system has to decrease the text size beyond a minimum threshold, say for example size 10, then it may be concluded
that the text does not fit at all.  D.7) Positioning Photos in Photo Slots with Focal Boxes
<br/><br/> A design may have content that are overlapping other content.  This can happen for many reasons, but most likely will be for stylistics reasons.  When an element is overlapping a photo slot, the photo may be repositioned in a photo slot so that
the point of focus stays away from the overlapping elements and thus keeps an adequate margin from these items.  This is implemented by utilizing focal boxes.  A focal box is defined on a layout or design as a rectangular area within a photo slot that is
considered as "visible" or "unobstructed." In other words, it is the area on a design where the photo can be seen clearly.  If a photo slot is completely uncovered, then this area would simply be the dimensions of the photo slot itself.  A focal area can
be represented by any shape, not just a box, as long as it is a continuous shape.  Accordingly, the invention ensures that the photo is placed inside the focal box of the photo slot.
<br/><br/>CONCLUSIONS
