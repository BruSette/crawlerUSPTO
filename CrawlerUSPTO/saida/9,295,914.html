<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>The invention claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A system for a-synchronous multi-player network-based and turn-based gaming, the system comprising a gaming server and a plurality of client devices, the gaming
server having a processing unit configured to: receive, by the gaming server, over a network tournament parameters from at least one client device associated with a tournament creator, the tournament parameters including: a list of two or more selected
players wherein the two or more selected players are selected by the tournament creator, and wherein each of the two or more selected players are associated with a respective client device;  and a time interval defining a duration of each player's turn; 
send, by the gaming server over a network, tournament invitations to the client devices associated the selected players;  receive, by the gaming server, participation authorization from the client devices associated with at least two of the selected
players;  start, by the gaming server, a tournament comprised of one or more games wherein each game includes two or more of those selected players from whom the participation authorization was received, and for each game: initiate, by the gaming server,
a turn for a first player of the included players, wherein a duration of the turn is equal to the time interval;  and responsive to receiving no response from the client device associated with the first player during the turn, perform, by the gaming
server a penalizing action associated with the first player.
<br/><br/> 2.  The system of claim 1 wherein the gaming server further includes a game logic module comprising at least one set of game rules, each defined by a game logic, and wherein the gaming server is further configured to instruct the processing unit
to manage the games according to one of the at least one game logics.
<br/><br/> 3.  The system of claim 1 wherein the gaming server is further configured by programming code to instruct the processing unit to dynamically allocate the selected players to games.
<br/><br/> 4.  The system of claim 3 wherein the tournament parameters further include a parameter of a minimum number of players for a single game, and wherein the gaming server is further configured to instruct the processing unit to generate a game when
a number of players not included in a game is equal to or larger than the parameter of a minimum number of players for a single game.
<br/><br/> 5.  The system of claim 1 wherein the tournament parameters further include a parameter of a minimum number of players in the tournament parameter and wherein the gaming server is configured to instruct the processing unit to start the
tournament only if the participation authorization was received from more than the minimum number of players in the tournament.
<br/><br/> 6.  The system of claim 1 wherein the tournament parameters further include a time window in which the tournament is not active and wherein the time interval is paused for a duration of the time window.

<br/><br/> This invention relates to the field of network-based gaming, and more specifically to the field of a-synchronous multi-player network-based gaming.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Internet gaming enables a person (hereinafter: "user") having access to a computer, a cellular phone or other computerized device with Internet (or other network) access, to log-in to the Internet and access a plurality of on-line games.  Some
of the games can be multi-player games in which a user can play with other users from all around the world.
<br/><br/> One type of such Internet gaming is a-synchronous multi-player network-based gaming, in which a user does not have to be connected to the Internet throughout the game.  In such type of gaming, each user has a certain time-frame to perform a game
move once his turn comes.
<br/><br/> However, a-synchronous multi-player network-based gaming platforms nowadays have many limitations.  For example, a user is unable to choose the players with whom he is interested in playing, nor can he control any other game parameter.  In
addition, when more than two users participate in a tournament, a user losing a single game of the tournament has to wait until the game round is finished in order to enter the next game round, as the games are not managed dynamically.  Still further, in
some cases a message is sent to a user when a game move has been made.  Such messages are usually sent to one pre-defined platform, such as an e-mail account, and there is no multi-platform support enabling sending messages to multiple platforms such as
cellular phones, e-mail accounts, social network accounts, etc.
<br/><br/> There is thus a need in the art for a new method and system for a-synchronous multi-player network-based gaming.
<br/><br/> Prior art references considered to be relevant as background to the presently disclosed subject matter are listed below.  Acknowledgement of the references herein is not to be inferred as meaning that these are in any way relevant to the
patentability of the presently disclosed subject matter.
<br/><br/> US Patent application No. 2002/0061778 (Acres) published on May 23, 2002 discloses a method and system for receiving and playing a computer game.  In one embodiment, the user executes a game program that is self-contained within an email message
sent by a game server computer system.  If the outcome of the game indicates success, then the computer game may display instructions on how to redeem a reward.  Because the computer game is sent via email, and stored in the user's email system, the user
can choose to play the game even when no connection to a game web site is established.  The user can later redeem his rewards, if any, when a connection to a redemption web site is established.  Thus, the user can play the computer games even when not
connected to the game web site.
<br/><br/> US Patent application No. 2009/0280892 (Lutnick et al.) published on Nov.  12, 2009 discloses methods of tracking points among participants in various wagers.  An indication of a wager may be received, including point distributions,
participants, an event, etc. An indication of an outcome of the wager may be received.  Points may be allocated among participants in accordance with a desired point distribution based on the outcome of the wager.  An indication of a point adjustment may
be received, and points may be adjusted accordingly.  The point adjustment may be associated with an external exchange between participants in a wager.
<br/><br/> U.S.  Pat.  No. 2,373,138 (Harvey et al.) published on Sep. 11, 2002 discloses a game played via the text messaging facility of a portable radio-frequency communication device (e.g. a cellular radio-telephone) and an apparatus for playing that
game.  The text messaging facility is able to transmit and receive pre-stored messages substantially instantaneously.  The game may be played between two players, or one player and a remote game playing server, text messages being exchanged between the
players and/or server.  The player can place a wager on the outcome of the game, which may be of the lottery spot-the-ball football pools safe-cracking quiz snooker-theme slot-machine craps roulette blackjack or pontoon poker or bingo-type games.  The
player may have credits removed from or added to their account as a result of their wager, or be charged via a credit or debit account or through their normal bill.  The player may be identified by a normally transmitted identity code, or via a personal
identification code entered on the keypad of the telephone.  The player is notified if he has won.
<br/><br/> U.S.  Pat.  No. 2,359,640 (Gouge) published on Aug.  29, 2001 discloses a method comprising the steps of receiving an electronic mail (email) addressed to a first addressee having data representing a second addressee, extracting the address of
the second addressee, and creating and sending a second email to the second addressee.  The second email may include graphical data, such as an advertisement.  The method may be applied to an online game, where participants send emails to a game server
(the first addressee), which processes the information included in an email, and sends a challenge from a challenger to an opponent corresponding to the second addressee.  Upon receiving a reply from the opponent, the game server processes the data
required to carry out the game with parameters specified in emails sent by the challenger and the opponent.  The game may be a battle.  The outcome may be sent to the challenger and to the opponent.

<br/><br/> Clients (101-1 to 101-n) can be configured to receive input parameters from players associated therewith.  The input parameters can include, inter alia, log-in parameters enabling identification of a player (e.g. user name and password,
biometric identification data, etc.) or log-out parameters.  It is to be noted that more than one player can be associated with each of clients (101-1 to 101-n).  For example, a first player can log-in to system 100 via a specific client (e.g. a portable
computer), and then log-out of system 100.  Following the first player log-out of system 100 a second player can log-in to system 100 via the same client using his own log-in parameters.  In addition, it is to be noted that a specific player can also be
associated with more than one of clients (101-1 to 101-n).  For example, a user can log-in to the system via a first client (e.g. a personal computer) and via a second client (e.g. a cellular phone).  In some cases, system 100 can be configured to enable
a player to be logged-in through a plurality of clients (101-1 to 101-n) simultaneously (e.g. a personal computer and a cellular phone).
<br/><br/> Clients can be further configured to communicate all or part of the received input parameters to gaming server 110.  The input parameters can also include, for example, parameters for creating a new tournament.  Such parameters for creating a
new tournament can include, for example, the tournament start date, a time interval for a player to make a game move (in some cases, if a player does not make a move within this pre-determined time interval he, for example, loses his turn, or loses the
game or loses points or money), a minimum number of players in a tournament, etc. The input parameters can also include parameters associated with a game move a player is interested in performing (for example, in Monopoly, buying a property, etc.). 
Gaming server 110 can comprise event collector module 130 for receiving the input parameters from clients (101-1 to 101-n) and directing them to the appropriate module for handling.  Gaming server 110 can further comprise tournament management module
140.  In some cases all input parameters are directed to tournament management module 140, which then handles them as further detailed below.  In some cases, tournament management module 140 directs all or part of the input parameters to other modules
for handling.
<br/><br/> Tournament management module 140 can be further configured to receive from event collector module 130 input parameters for creating a new tournament and create a new tournament accordingly.  Tournament management module 140 can be further
configured to store the received input parameters in data repository 150 associated with gaming server 110.  Data repository 150 can be for example non-volatile or volatile memory, including, but not limited to, RAM, ROM, flash memory, etc. Tournament
management module 140 can be also configured to start a tournament if the conditions to start the tournament are met, as further described below.
<br/><br/> Gaming server 110 can also comprise game logic module 160.  Game logic module 160 can be configured to receive, for example from tournament management module 140 or event collector module 130, input parameters associated with a game move a
player is interested in performing and validate the requested move.  In case the requested move is valid, game logic module 160 can be configured to instruct tournament management module 140 to perform the requested move and update data repository 150
accordingly.  Game logic module 160 is further configured to check if performance of the move results in triggering an event according to the pre-defined game rules.  Such an event can be, inter alia, a certain player winning or losing a game.  In
certain games, according to certain game logics, such an event can be, inter alia, paying a "fine" such as in the game of Monopoly.  In case an event is triggered by the requested move, game logic module 160 can be configured to instruct tournament
management module 140 to perform the event and update data repository 150 accordingly.
<br/><br/> Gaming server 110 can further comprise a messaging module 170.  Messaging module 170 can be configured to receive a notification from tournament management module 140 and create a personalized notification directed to the relevant player or
players.  Such notifications may be for example notification about tournament start, notification about tournament end, notification about a move performed by one of the players, notification about an illegal move performed by a player, etc. Messaging
module 170 can be configured to generate the notifications to the relevant player or players in compatibility to one or more types of clients (101-1 to 101-n), e.g. a personal computer (for example via a dedicated website), a cellular phone (for example
via a text message), etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating one example of a sequence of operations carried out for creating an a-synchronous multi-player tournament, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter.  Process 200 begins when a player interested
in creating a tournament (hereinafter "tournament creator") connects to system 100 (step 210).  In case the tournament creator is not registered to system 100, system 100 can be configured to request the tournament creator to perform an initial
registration step in which he will be required to provide, inter alia, details for his identification (e.g. user name and password, biometric identification data, etc.).  Such identification details will be saved in data repository 150.
<br/><br/> After connecting or registering to system 100 the tournament creator can generate a new tournament (step 220).  Following generation of a new tournament the tournament creator can set the tournament and game parameters (step 230).  At this
stage, the tournament creator can set, inter alia, and by way of example: a. A name for the tournament, to be later used in order to identify the tournament from other tournaments taking place in the system.  b. A minimum player score for entering the
tournament.  In this regard it is to be noted that player scores can be maintained by system 100 and saved in data repository 150.  In such a manner, each registered player is associated with a score that is updated according to the game rules and his
performance in the tournament games.  Thus, a tournament creator can decide that registration to the created tournament will be limited to players with a minimum or maximum score for example.  c. The type of game to be played in the tournament, e.g.
Monopoly, Checkers, Tic-tac-toe, Poker, etc. d. A minimum number of players in the tournament, a minimum number of players in a game.  In Monopoly, for example, the tournament creator can decide that at least 4 players must play in each game.  It is to
be noted however that in some cases there can be an exception to the rule, for example, when there are not enough players to meet this restriction.  In such cases, a smaller number of players in a table can be allowed.  e. A maximum number of players in
a game.  In Checkers, for example, the maximum number of players in a game is two players.  In other game types however, the number of players in a game can be higher than 2, and in some cases there is no restriction on a maximum number of players
arising from the game rules.  In such cases, the tournament creator can decide on a maximum number of players in a single game.  f. A minimum number of players in a game.  In Checkers, for example, the minimum number of players in a game is two players. 
In some cases the tournament creator can decide that the minimum number of players in a game is higher than two (in cases where the game rules enable it).  g. A time interval parameter for a player to make a game move.  In a-synchronous multi-player
gaming this is an important parameter, defining the time given to a player to perform a game move as his turn comes.  Looking at FIG. 7, illustrating an one example of game table, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter, one may assume
that the game has just started and a certain game began between P1 (player 1), P2 (player 2), P3 (player 3), P4 (player 4), P5 (player 5), P6 (player 6), and further assume that P1 has the first turn, and P2 has the second turn (as, for example, the
system 100 randomly selected the turns or that the turns are calculated according to a score associated with each of the players and saved in data repository 150).  According to the time interval, P1 has a limited time to perform his move.  The time
interval can be, for example, 5 hours, after which, if the player did not perform any legal move, system 100 can be configured to perform an action.  Such action can be, for example, but not limited to: i. Passing the turn to the next player; ii.  Taking
the player out of the game; iii.  Reducing player score; iv.  Making a pre-determined or random move instead of the player.  h. A time window in which the tournament is not active.  As detailed above, each player has a time interval to make a game move
as his turn comes.  In some cases, it may be desired to exclude certain time frames from such restriction.  For example, night hours (for example 10 pm to 10 am) may be excluded, such that during these hours the time interval for a player to make his
game move is not counted.  Thus, if a player's turn comes at 9:45 pm and the time interval for a player to make a game move is set to 2 hours, the time interval will end at 11:45 am and not at 11:45 pm.  In addition, certain days or dates can be also
excluded such that on certain days or dates the time interval for a player to make his game move is not counted.  For example, weekends (Friday to Sunday) may be excluded, etc. i. A parameter indicating if the tournament is a public or a private
tournament.  A public tournament is a tournament in which every player who is registered to system 100 can join by selecting to do so from a list of available public tournaments (for example, tournaments that the tournament creator set as public and that
the maximum players in a tournament has not been met yet).  A private tournament is a tournament to which the tournament creator can invite players (registered or not registered, as further detailed with respect to step 240) whereas only those invitees
can join the tournament at their will (as further described with reference to FIG. 3).
<br/><br/> Following setting of the tournament and game parameters (it is to be emphasized that the above list contains examples of tournament and game parameters and other tournament and game parameters can be also exist) by the tournament creator, the
tournament creator can invite players to the created tournament (step 240).  Regardless of the tournament being, for example, private or public, as detailed above, the tournament creator can provide information on other players, whether registered to the
system or not, to be invited to the tournament.  System 100 can be configured, for example, to enable the tournament creator to insert a list of e-mail addresses and/or, phone numbers, etc., of players the tournament creator is interested in inviting to
the tournament.  Alternatively or additionally, system 100 can be configured to import and display to the tournament creator a list of friends of the tournament creator from, for example, a social network (e.g. <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> AOL, Yahoo!, etc.) by utilizing a
publically available standard API for that purpose.
<br/><br/> Looking at FIG. 8, illustrating one example of an interaction between a gaming server and a social network for retrieving a list of friends from the social network, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter, gaming server 110 can
be configured to provide the social network with parameters 820.  The parameters can include, inter alia, social network user identification parameters such as username and password, and parameters defining the requested information (for example an
indication that the requested data from social network 810 is the entire friends list of the user or a certain part of the friends list, etc.).  Social network 810 is configured to authenticate the identification parameters.  If the user is
authenticated, social network is configured to provide gaming server with the requested friends list 830.
<br/><br/> Returning to FIG. 1, the tournament creator can select friends to be invited to the tournament from the friends list received from the social network (in addition to inserting a list of e-mail addresses and/or phone numbers, etc. as described
above).
<br/><br/> In some cases, system 100 can be configured to manage a list of players that the tournament creator has previously selected as tournament friends.  For this purpose, system 100 can enable a player to add friends to the list.  Such friend lists
can, in some cases, comprise only registered players.  In some cases, system 100 can be configured to enable the tournament creator to filter the users according to certain criteria.  For example, system 100 can enable the tournament creator to filter
the friends list according to their current score in the system.  For this purpose, system 100 can be configured, for example, to check for each friend in the friends list, if it is registered to system 100, and if so, retrieve the friend's score from
data repository 150.  Thus, if the tournament creator is interested, for example, in creating a tournament for players that have a score higher than a certain threshold, system 100 can filter out from the friends list friends that are not registered to
system 100 and friends having a score higher that the threshold set by the tournament creator.  Other filter criteria can be available, inter alia, according to the data saved in the data repository 150.
<br/><br/> Following selection of players to be invited to the tournament by the tournament creator, system 100 can be configured to send invitation notifications to the selected players, selected by the tournament creator to be invited to the tournament. 
The invitation notifications can be sent to a plurality of clients (101-1 to 101-n) utilizing a plurality of messaging methods, including, but not limited to, e-mail messages, text messages to cellular phones, messages to social network accounts
(utilizing, for example, publically available API's to interact with the social networks), etc. System 100 can be configured to utilize e-mail addresses and/or cellular phone numbers and/or social network accounts, etc. provided to it by tournament
creator or by social network 810.  In some cases in which the players to be invited to the tournament are registered to system 100, system 100 can retrieve the required data (e.g. cellular phone numbers, e-mail addresses, social network accounts) from
data repository 150 and utilize the retrieved data in order to send the invitation notifications to the players to be invited to the tournament.  FIG. 6 is flowchart illustrating one example of a sequence of operations carried out for sending
notifications to invitees or participants of an a-synchronous multi-player tournament, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter.  Process 600, which begins as a notification, is generated by system 100 (step 610).  Such a notification
can include details regarding the created tournament, such as, for example, the tournament creator, the start date, the time interval for a player to make a game move, etc. In some cases, the invitation notifications can also contain a link for accepting
the invitation to the tournament.  Following creation of the invitation notification (or any other notification), system 100 can be further configured to create platform compatible invitation notifications (or any other notification) (step 620). 
Reverting to FIG. 9, a block diagram schematically illustrates one example of simultaneous notification distribution to multiple platforms, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter.  As detailed above, the notification can be directed to
a plurality of clients.  Clients 101-1 and 101-2 can be for example cellular phones and client 101-3 and 101-n can be for example laptop computers.  Messaging module 170 can be configured to generate a platform compatible notification to each respective
client.  Thus, a text message for a cellular phone will be generated according to a cellular phone format for clients 101-1 and 101-2, whereas an e-mail message will be generated according to e-mail messages format for client 101-3 and 101-n.
<br/><br/> Returning to FIG. 6, after generating the platform compatible invitation notifications (or any other notification) by messaging module 170, system 100 can be configured to send the generated platform compatible notifications to the tournament
invitees (step 630).
<br/><br/> After sending invitation notifications to the players to be invited to the tournament, system 100 can be further configured to initiate the tournament (step 250).  At this stage, a tournament is created and saved in data repository 150 along
with all relevant data provided by the tournament creator (e.g. the tournament and game parameters set by the tournament creator, the invited players, etc.).
<br/><br/> Following tournament initiation, and, in some cases, depending on fulfillment of certain conditions as further discussed with reference to FIG. 4, the tournament starts and system can be configured to manage the tournament (step 260) as further
discussed with reference to FIG. 5.
<br/><br/> Turning to FIG. 3, a flowchart illustration of one example of a sequence of operations carried out by an invitee for accepting an invitation to an a-synchronous multi-player tournament, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter,
is depicted.  At the first step, a player receives an invitation to a tournament (step 310).  As described above, the invitation notifications can be sent to a plurality of clients (101-1 to 101-n) utilizing a plurality of messaging methods, including,
but not limited to, e-mail messages, text messages to cellular phones, messages to social network accounts, etc. As further detailed above, the invitation notification can, in some cases, contain a link for accepting the invitation to the game.  Pressing
the acceptance link can, for example, cause issuance of a notification to system 100 indicating that the player invited to the tournament has accepted the invitation.  In other cases other methods for issuing acceptance notifications to system 100 can be
utilized, for instance, opening a web-browser (such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, etc.) in which an acceptance button or other acceptance enabling element can be used by the player invited to the tournament to indicate that he is accepting the
invitation to the tournament.  Another example of a method to accept an invitation can be, for example, replying to the origin of the invitation notification (e.g. replying to the e-mail address from which the e-mail invitation notification originated,
replying to the phone number from which the text message invitation notification originated, etc.).
<br/><br/> System 100 can be configured to receive notifications from players that accepted the invitation to the tournament (step 320).  In case system 100 receives a notification that a player has accepted the invitation to the tournament, system 100 can
be configured to check if the tournament creator set a maximum limit of players in the tournament (step 330).  If there is a maximum players number in the tournament limit, system 100 can be configured to check if there is still place available in the
tournament (if the number of players currently registered to the tournament is lower than the maximum players in the tournament limit) (step 340).  If there is no available place in the tournament, system 100 can be configured to notify the player that
accepted the invitation that there is no available place in the tournament (step 350).  It is to be noted that system 100 can be configured to check for existence of other criteria parameters set by the tournament creator (e.g. minimum score for entering
the tournament, etc.) in the same manner.
<br/><br/> If there is no maximum limit of players in the tournament, or, there is still an available place(s) in the tournament (and/or, in some cases, other criteria parameter set by the tournament creator is met), system 100 can be configured to check
(for example by fetching the relevant data from data repository 150) if the player that accepted the invitation is registered to system 100 (step 360).  In case the player is not registered to system 100, system 100 can be configured to register the user
(step 370).  For this purpose, system 100 can be configured, for example, to redirect the player to a registration web-page, or automatically register the player to system 100.  Such automatic registration can be performed, inter alia, by using an
identifying data such as the data provided by the tournament creator when inviting the player to the tournament (e.g. player phone number, e-mail address, etc.).  If the player is registered to system 100 or after his registration to system 100, system
100 can be configured to add the player to the tournament to which he accepted the invitation (step 380) and update data repository 150 accordingly.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating one example of a sequence of operations carried out for starting an a-synchronous multi-player tournament, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter.  System 100 can be configured to check, for
example periodically, for each tournament that has not yet started, if the start date of the tournament, set by the tournament creator, has arrived (step 410).  If the start data of the tournament did not arrive, system 100 is configured to repeatedly
perform the check if the start data has arrived, for example periodically.  If the start date of the tournament has arrived, system 100 can be configured to check if enough players accepted the invitation to the tournament (step 420).  In some cases a
minimum number of players is required in light of specific game rules.  For example, for a game of checkers, at least two players are required (as a single game requires two players).  In such cases, system 100 can be configured to check that enough
players accepted the invitation to enable playing at least one game according to the game rules.  In case the tournament creator set a minimum number of participants in tournament, system 100 can be further configured to check that enough players
accepted the invitation in order to meet the limitation.  In case enough players accepted the invitation, system 100 can be further configured to start the tournament, as further elaborated with respect to FIG. 5.  If, however, not enough players
accepted the invitation, system 100 can be configured to send a notification to the tournament creator (step 440), indicating that there are not enough participants in the created tournament at the tournament start date.  The tournament creator can then
instruct system 100 to change the tournament start date (step 450).  If the tournament creator is not interested in changing the tournament start date, system 100 can be configured to cancel the tournament (step 460).  Such deletion of the tournament can
include, inter alia, deleting the corresponding records from data repository 150.  In case the tournament creator instructs system 100 to change the start date of the tournament, system 100 can be configured to send notifications indicating the new
tournament start date to the players invited to the tournament (step 470).
<br/><br/> Turning to FIG. 5, a flowchart illustrates one example of a sequence of operations carried out for managing an a-synchronous multi-player tournament, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter.  Process 500 begins by starting a
tournament (step 505).  A tournament starts when all conditions (including conditions set by tournament creator, such as tournament start date, etc. and conditions that result from the specific game logic for the tournament, such as minimum number of
players, etc.) for starting the tournament, are met.
<br/><br/> After the tournament starts, system 100 can be configured to generate game tables (step 510).  For this purpose, system 100 can be configured to utilize the tournament and game parameters provided by the tournament creator.  As noted above, a
tournament is a set of one or more games, wherein each game involves a subset of at least two of the tournament players.  As detailed above, the tournament creator can, in some cases, select the type of game to be played in the tournament.  Each type of
game is associated with a set of game rules stored in data repository 150 and utilized by game logic module 160 as detailed above and further detailed below.  Part of the game rules can include a minimum and/or maximum number of players participating in
a single game of the tournament.  Additionally or alternatively, tournament creator can also decide on a minimum and/or maximum number of players in a single game of the tournament.  System 100 can utilize the number of players registered to the
tournament and the maximum and/or minimum number of players in a single game limitations imposed by the game rules and/or by the tournament creator for generating one or more logical game tables, in which a single game of the tournament occurs.  By way
of example, assuming that ten players accepted the invitation to the tournament, and assuming that the game type selected for the tournament is a Tic-Tac-Toe, five game tables will be generated by system 100.  This is of course a result of the fact that
according to the game rules of the game Tic-Tac-Toe, two players play in a single game.  If, however, the game type selected by the tournament creator is Monopoly, system 100 can generate a single game assuming that there is no limitation on the number
of players in a single game in the game of Monopoly.  If however, there is a limitation of, for example, a maximum number of four players in a single game (either due to the game rules or due to the maximum number of players in a game parameter provided
by the tournament creator), system 100 can be configured to generate three game tables while assigning four players to the first and second game tables and two players to a third game table--thus all ten players are assigned to a game table.  Further
assuming that there is an additional limitation of, for example, a minimum number of three players in a single game table (either due to the game rules or due to the minimum number of players in a game parameter provided by the tournament creator),
system 100 can be configured to generate for example two game tables while assigning four players to the first and second game tables.  In such cases, the remaining two players will wait until at least one player will be removed from one of the two game
tables generated by system 100 (for example in case the player lost the game, etc.), thus enabling generation of a third game table with the two players that were not assigned to any of the first and second game tables and the at least one player that
was removed from one of the two game tables.  It is to be noted that this is a mere example of a process of generating game tables and game tables can be generated by utilizing other methods.
<br/><br/> After generation of game tables and assignment of players thereto, system 100 can be configured to initiate the games (step 515).  In such an initiation stage, system 100 can be configured, inter alia, to determine what will be the order of
participation in each game (the turns, i.e. who will be the player to make the first move in each game table, who will be the player to make the second move in each game table, etc.).
<br/><br/> Once the games are initiated, system 100 can be configured to receive game move commands (step 520).  Such game move commands originate from clients associated with players participating in a game--in their turn.  System 100 can be configured in
a way that a player will be able to send a game move command only when it is his turn to make a move in the game table.
<br/><br/> When receiving a game move command, system 100 can be configured to check if the game move command is a legal command according to the game logic of the selected game type (step 525).  As detailed above, each game type is associated with a game
logic thus enabling validation of the received game move commands in view of the specific game rules.  In case the received game move command is not a legal commend, system 100 can be configured to send an appropriate notification to the player that
initiated the game move command (step 530).  Such notification can be sent to a plurality of clients (101-1 to 101-n) associated with the player that initiated the game move command (e.g. a text message for cellular phone and an e-mail address for a
personal computer) utilizing a plurality of messaging methods, as detailed above with respect to sending invitation notifications step in FIG. 1.  If however, the received game move command is a legal command, system 100 can be configured to perform the
received game move command (step 535) and update data repository 150 accordingly.  In some cases, performance of a game move command can have an effect, defined by the game rules of the specific game type, on a player score.  Such an effect can be a
positive effect or a negative effect, as defined by the game rules.  For example, in Monopoly, certain game moves can cause a player to lose his turn, to receive points, to lose points, etc. As in some cases the score represents money, such points
addition or deduction can represent in some cases losing or gaining money.  Another example is in Poker in which a game move is characterized in some cases, inter alia, by betting a certain amount of score (representing money in system 100).  Betting a
score (representing money in system 100) results in reducing the amount of score (representing money in system 100) of the betting player.  When a player wins a game--all scores betted by any of the players of the game table is added to his score
(representing money in system 100).  It is to be noted that other game types can have other scoring methods and each scoring method can be managed by game logic module 160, independently of any other module of system 100.
<br/><br/> Once the game move command is performed, and the respective updates are made to data repository 150, system 100 can be configured to send appropriate notifications to all players participating in the game in which the game move has been made
(step 540).  Such notifications can also be sent to a plurality of clients (101-1 to 101-n) associated with the players participating in the game in which the game move has been made, utilizing a plurality of messaging methods as detailed above.
<br/><br/> System 100 can be further configured to check if a specific game move performed by a player caused a player to be removed from a game table (step 545).  A player can be removed from a game table, for example, if, according to the game rules, he
lost the game or, another non-limiting example is choosing to quit a game (for example in Poker, a player can choose to fold out of a game).  If no player is removed from a game table, the system 100 can be configured to continue receiving game move
commands and repeat the process detailed above for each received game move command.  However, if a player is removed from a game table pursuant to performance of the game move command, system 100 can be configured to check if the tournament has ended
(step 550).  A tournament can come to an end, for example, when there remains only one player that did not lose a game, or when all players lost all of their scores (as detailed above, the score can represent money in some cases, thus losing all of the
score representing the money can be regarded as losing the tournament).  Another option is that a certain player reached a pre-defined number of game winnings.  It is to be noted that a tournament can come to an end in other ways and all examples
provided above are non-limiting.
<br/><br/> If the tournament has ended, system 100 can be configured to send notifications to all of the players that participated in the tournament (step 555).  Such notifications can also be sent to a plurality of clients (101-1 to 101-n) associated with
the players that participated in the tournament, utilizing a plurality of messaging methods as detailed above.  Following sending of the notifications, system 100 can be configured to end the tournament (step 560).
<br/><br/> In some cases, in case the tournament did not end in light of the player removal from the game table, system 100 can be configured to update data repository 150 to indicate that the player removed from the game table is not part of any game
table in the tournament.  System 100 can be further configured to check if the number of players that are not assigned to any game table is equal to the minimum number of players for a single game of the tournament as defined by the game rules and/or by
the tournament creator as detailed above (hereinafter: "minimum players for new table").  If the number of players that are not assigned to any game table is lower than the minimum players for new table, system 100 can be configured to continue receiving
game move commands.  If, however, the number of players that are not assigned to any game table is equal to the minimum players for new table, system 100 can be configured to create a new table (step 570) and assign the players that are not assigned to
any game table to the new table.  Following creation of a new table, the system 100 initiates the game in the new table (step 575).  In such an initiation stage, system 100 can be configured, inter alia, to determine what will be the order of
participation in each game (as detailed above with respect to step 515).
<br/><br/> It is to be noted that in some cases, (for example, according to certain game rules) according to certain game logic conditions, a player is removed from the tournament and not assigned to a new game table.  Such game logic conditions can be,
for example, losing two consecutive games, reaching a zero score (for example, in Poker, when a user bets all of his score (representing money) in a game and loses the game), etc.
