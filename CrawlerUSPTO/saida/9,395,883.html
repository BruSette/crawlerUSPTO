       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> Systems and methods to provide social analytics information are
     disclosed. An exemplary system may include a database and a server
     coupled to the database. The server may include a business analytics
     module configured to receive data related to a business and generate,
     based on the received data, a set of business analytics information, and
     store the business analytics information in the database. The server
     further may include an interactive display module configured to generate
     an interactive object based on the business analytics information,
     provide controlled access to the interactive object to a first user of a
     predefined group of users, and provide a display of the interactive
     object to a second user of the predefined group of users. The interactive
     display module may be further configured to update, responsive to an
     input from the first user, the interactive object so as to generate an
     updated interactive object, and provide, responsive to the updating, a
     display of the updated interactive object to the second user.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/>Overview
<br/><br/> Business Analytics is a rapidly growing technology field related to providing businesses with business users with data and information regarding this business.  Business analytics tools can be used by businesses to allow them to better
understand the mechanics and details of their business, at both the micro and macro-levels.
<br/><br/> Typical business analytics tools and applications include performing rigorous statistical and quantitative analyses of business data, which is typically done in a continuous, iterative fashion.  Results can be used by businesses to provide
insights into a company's performance that may otherwise be unapparent.  For example, business analytics solutions can identify trends, provide alerts, and make predictions.  Some applications of business analytics and associated business analytics
systems and processing are described in, for example, U.S.  Provisional Patent Application Ser.  No. 61/442,467, filed Feb.  14, 2011, entitled METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR INTERACTIVE DATA MANAGEMENT USING AN APPLICATION PLUG-IN, in U.S.  Utility patent
application Ser.  No. 13/396,362, filed Feb.  14, 2012, entitled METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR INTERACTIVE DATA MANAGEMENT USING AN APPLICATION PLUG-IN, in U.S.  Provisional Patent Application Ser.  No. 61/477,993, filed Apr.  21, 2011, entitled METHODS AND
SYSTEMS FOR PREDICTIVE ALERTING, and in U.S.  Utility patent application Ser.  No. 13/453,926, filed Apr.  23, 2012, entitled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR PREDICTIVE ALERTING (denoted collectively herein as the "Related Applications").  The content of each of
these Related Applications is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
<br/><br/> A field closely related to Business Analytics is Web Analytics (WA), which provides statistical analysis of a company's web traffic and related information.
<br/><br/> This disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for integrating business analytics and analysis, processing, and presentation of associated information within business or social networks.  Such integrated systems and associated
applications may be denoted as "Social Analytics" (SA) systems to describe seamlessly blended Social or Business Media with Business Analytics.
<br/><br/> These integrated systems may provide various advantages over existing technology.  For example, existing BA solutions are highly data centric and provide little to no ability for interaction among users.  Users of current systems are typically
provided only with data or information, and have no ability to interact with the data or information, define groups of other users with which to share the information, or update or change the data or information.  As such, users rely on email, SMS
message, or even phone calls to have conversations with other users to share or discuss business information.
<br/><br/> In yet another aspect, the present disclosure relates to another method for providing social analytics information.  The method of this aspect includes providing, to a first user of a social analytics system, a user interface including a menu
option to subscribe to a report to be provided to a plurality of users of the social analytics system, receiving, from the first user, a request to subscribe to the report, and providing, responsive to generation or update of the report, a presentation
of the report in a flow associated with the first user.
<br/><br/> In yet another aspect, the present disclosure relates to another system for providing social analytics information.  The system of this aspect includes a memory and a processor coupled to the memory.  The processor is configured to provide, to a
first user of a social analytics system, a user interface including a menu option to subscribe to a report to be provided to a plurality of users of the social analytics system, receive, from the first user, a request to subscribe to the report, and
provide, responsive to generation or update of the report, a presentation of the report in a flow associated with the first user.
<br/><br/> In yet another aspect, the present disclosure relates to another computer program product comprising a computer-readable medium including codes executable by a processor.  The codes cause the processor to provide, to a first user of a social
analytics system, a user interface including a menu option to subscribe to a report to be provided to a plurality of users of the social analytics system, receive, from the first user, a request to subscribe to the report, and provide, responsive to
generation or update of the report, a presentation of the report in a flow associated with the first user.
<br/><br/> In yet another aspect, the present disclosure relates to another system for providing social analytics information.  The system of this aspect includes memory means, means for providing, to a first user of a social analytics system, a user
interface including a menu option to subscribe to a report to be provided to a plurality of users of the social analytics system, means for receiving, from the first user, a request to subscribe to the report, and means for providing, responsive to
generation or update of the report, a presentation of the report in a flow associated with the first user.
<br/><br/> For example, embodiments of the present invention allow users to interact with each other in a social-networking like interface with combined business analytics functionality.  Various functions may be included in displays or other interfaces
that may be provided on a webpage, allowing a user to access the interface and information through a standard web browser, and/or through a standalone application, that may provide web-like functionality with additional advantages and/or controls
available through a standalone application.
<br/><br/> Functions that may be included in various business analytics systems embodiments may include, for example, one or more search bars, configured to allow users to search through shared content in a flow (as described subsequently below), as well
as providing the ability to search for alerts, reports, recipes, contacts, and/or other data or information.  In some embodiments, a search bar may be coupled with other functionality, such as, for example, Natural Language Processing (NLP), where a
search term or phrase may be processed to generate visualization or other information.
<br/><br/> In another aspect, social analytics system embodiments may be configured to facilitate content sharing, whereby reports, visualizations, alerts, scheduled information (such as scheduled reports), and/or other data or information may be shared,
in a controlled or monitored fashion, among appropriate users.  In addition, in another aspect, users may be provided with a mechanism to comment and/or update shared information.  For example, users may be allowed to attach files (e.g., PDF, XLS, PNG,
etc.), answer with responsive visualizations, and/or otherwise be provided with a mechanism to provide comment and feedback.
<br/><br/> In another aspect, social analytics system embodiments may be configured to provide interactive reports, including the ability for users to comment on visualizations, reports, and/or other data or information.  Some embodiments may allow users
to generate and/or amend or update information objects (denoted herein for brevity as "objects"), such as reports, data tables, graphs or other displays of information, summaries, or other business or web analytics data or information, and then share the
information with others using the business analytics interface.
<br/><br/> For example, a user may be provided with an interface to create and publish a report to other users (who are provided group or object or category access).  The other users may then be able to instantly see the report and comment on it.  In
addition, information associated with object creation, updates, comments, and/or other information may be provided to other users in the form of a feed, alert, page, or other indication.
<br/><br/> In addition, users or businesses may be provided with an interface to allow creation and editing of users' groups, as well as control how information may be generated, shared, amended, and distributed, as well as how objects may be edited,
displayed, distributed, etc.
<br/><br/> In addition, users may be provided with an interface to dynamically interact with objects in a social analytics system.  For example, a SA user may be allowed to interactively control an object such as a data display graph or other information,
with the updated information then shared immediately with other users.  Real-time interaction between the users may be provided, allowing applications such as real-time user interaction with commenting, feedback, etc., regarding the object or other
information being shared.
<br/><br/> Various additional aspects, details, features, and functions are described below in conjunction with the appended Drawing figures.
<br/><br/> The following exemplary embodiments are provided for the purpose of illustrating examples of various aspects, details, and functions of apparatus and systems; however, the described embodiments are not intended to be in any way limiting.  It
will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that various aspects may be implemented in other embodiments within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.
<br/><br/> It is noted that as used herein, the term, "exemplary" means "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any aspect, detail, function, implementation, and/or embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed
as preferred or advantageous over other aspects and/or embodiments.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates details of one embodiment of a user interface for a social analytics application in accordance with aspects of the present invention.  In a typical system, each business user will have a "Profile" 110, which includes
information about the user, such as a name or userid, photo or avatar, contact information (email, phone, address, etc.), and/or other user information.
<br/><br/> Users may be provided an interface to interact with the system in the form of a flow 120.  The flow 120 allows users to share objects and other information with other users, such as reports, alerts, etc. In addition, the flow 120 may be used as
a mechanism to allow users to interact with posts provided by other users and/or to leave comments and post responses with new visualizations (e.g., graphs or other graphical presentations of information), and/or attach files, such as JPEGs, PDFs, etc.
<br/><br/> Users may be allowed to control their flow 120.  For example, a user that is a member of multiple groups may be provided with an interface 130 to set filters or other controls to filter out unneeded or irrelevant information or groups (e.g.,
Marketing, Developers, System, etc.).  A flow with information about particular product features may also be provided.  For example, a flow may be filtered by product features, such as, for example, alerts, scheduled, reports, etc., so that a user is
presented with posts to their flow only from those specific features.
<br/><br/> An interface 140 to allow users to readily access frequently used or most common used reports or other information may be provided.  For example, reports or other objects may be listed by category of use or relevance.  Additional information may
be further accessed through a "more" function, allowing access to less important or less frequently used objects or other reports provided to or shared by the group or community (e.g., where a group is a subset of a community).
<br/><br/> An available users interface 150 may be provided to allow users to see which other associated users are online and/or available, such as for interactive communications.  For example, the users may be provided with a button or other mechanism to
initiate an interactive communication, videoconference (if webcams are available) and/or other interaction, such as a voice conference over the system.
<br/><br/> In addition, a "Live" button, such as shown, may be displayed in the interface, thereby allowing a user to view, in real time, a report or other object that an associated user is working on.  For example, in interface 150 as shown in FIG. 1, a
user may be provided with a "Live" button icon associated with another user (in this case Person #1), and selection of the icon may then allow the user to view the report that "Person #1" is working on, and/or may be allowed to comment on or otherwise
interact with Person #1 while the report is being worked on (e.g., created, edited, updated, etc.).  Additional details regarding aspects of this functionality are further described subsequently herein.  A user may also be provided with a webcam (e.g.,
audio and video), or audio interface to communicate with other users
<br/><br/> A user profile or other user identification panel 160 may be included to provide more information about others that a user is communicating with.  For example, a photo, avatar, or other user specific information, such as user's business card
and/or text information, such as email addresses, mail addresses, phone numbers, and/or other information may be included in panel 160.
<br/><br/> A search bar 170 may be included to allow users to search and identify content available to users, such as, for example, alerts, scheduled reports, contacts, groups, saved reports, information provided by other users into the flow, etc. Results
may be returned based on specific keyword searches and/or other processing, such as NLP processing on received phrases or other groups of terms.  For example, as a user types in text into the search bar, the entered string of characters may be processed
and a list of results may be displayed, such as, for example, by category and/or including a sub-selection of options or top hits with the category.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates additional details of an embodiment of a search bar interface 200, which may correspond with interface 170 of FIG. 1, including additional search-related results for an example search.  For example, if a user performs a search
starting with the term "sales" as shown, a listing of available information may be provided to the user, such as, for example, in the form of a category heading and available content or information.  For example, one category of potential importance may
be reports 210, and a list of possible reports 212 and 214 of the highest or most likely interest to the particular user may be provided as shown.  Although the example of FIG. 2 illustrates two sub-hits, it is apparent that various other numbers of
potential sub-hits may be shown in different embodiments.
<br/><br/> Other information of interest may include flows 220, with information identifying other users (e.g., Person #1 and Person #2 in this case) and associated information 222, 224, from their flows respectively, as well as Groups 230, which may
provide information regarding groups to which the user belongs, and Contacts 240, which may provide information regarding relevant contacts, such as other users with information and/or responsibility over business functions related to the search term(s). Other functions may also be provided, such as, for example, a selection option to allow a user to see more search results (function 250), change or amend search terms (not shown in FIG. 2), and/or perform other search-related functions (not shown).
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates additional details of an embodiment of a search bar 300, which may correspond with search bar 170 as shown in FIG. 1.  In a typical configuration, all functions or at least the most frequently accessed or most important should
be easy to access.  In order to provide this feature, natural language (NLP) search functionality may be used to make it easier for a user to go from a thought to a report.
<br/><br/> In the example of FIG. 3, the first search string text entered (e.g., "Top Pages anametrix.com for last month as Pie Chart") may be received by a business analytics system and parsed to generate relevant search terms, such as, for example,
information 350, such as top pages, most requested information, etc., a site or data source site 320 (in the case, a company name, website, etc., such as "anametrix.com"), a visualization 330 (e.g., a graph, chart or other visualization graphic), as well
as a date range 340 (e.g., last week or range of weeks, month, year, etc.).
<br/><br/> In an exemplary embodiment, information 350 is the type of information desired, such as, for example, "Top Pages" as shown, or other information, such as "Number of Impressions," (e.g., number of hits on a website) which may be a metric brought
into the system from a connector.  The site/data source 320 is a location where information may be found within the business analytics system, as well as additional related information such as filters to be applied to correctly present the information. 
A second example search string is "Number of Impressions (Information) for Campaign 2536874 (Site/Data Source) during this year (Date Range)" which may be similarly parsed.
<br/><br/> A date range 340, which may be optionally included, may be a static date range, such as 2011-05-01 to 2011-05-31 and/or a varying or relative date range, such as, for example, last week or last month (as shown in the second example search string
above).  If no date range is entered, a default date range or other date-range selection mechanism (such as, for example, a date range selected based on the type of information requested) may be used.  A visualization 330 may also optionally be included
(for example, the visualization is omitted for the second search string example described above).  For example, a type of graph or chart or other data presentation format may be specifically provided, or, if not, a default type may be applied as with the
date range 340.
<br/><br/> In order to be able to know whether a search term, such as, for example, "Subscribers," is linked to a certain connector (e.g., in this example an email marketing provider), it may be desirable to tag connectors and data sources.  When new
sources of data are provided to the business analytics system, they may be tagged accordingly so that a user may readily access the data through the search bar.
<br/><br/> In order to parse search terms, a number of possible algorithms may be used.  For example, in embodiments where the previous categories (e.g., information, data sources/sites, date range, and visualization) are used, one appropriate algorithm
for use is a decision tree algorithm (which may similarly be applied when additional and/or different categories are used).  In implementing a decision tree algorithm, an input string may be analyzed using dictionaries to identify a best matching case
(or cases).  An example of this is shown in flowchart embodiment 400 in FIG. 4, wherein a search term 410, such as the search strings described previously with respect to FIG. 3, may be parsed and the parsed terms matched at stage 420 to a set of
categories.  In the example shown, categories include those described with respect to FIG. 3, including a Date Range 421, Information 423, Visualizations 425, and a Data Source 427.  Each category may include a set of potential matching parameters, such
as date formats 422, information types 424, visualization types 426, and data sources 428.  Based on the matching parameters, a closest match (or matches) may be selected at stage 430.  For example, for an applied search term "Number of Impressions Today
in Table Form," the corresponding results 430, including a match of the term "today" 432 with Date Range category 421, "impressions" 434 with category "Information" 423, "Table" 436 with category "Visualization" 425, and "Campaign 912312" 438 with the
Data Source category 427.  By using this approach, appropriate search criteria may be identified and then used to search for relevant information.
<br/><br/> Some embodiments may be implemented in a plug-in and use an application programming interface (API), such as described in U.S.  Provisional Patent Application Ser.  No. 61/442,467, filed Feb.  24, 2011, entitled METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR
INTERACTIVE DATA MANAGEMENT USING AN APPLICATION PLUG-IN, and in U.S.  Utility patent application Ser.  No. 13/396,362, filed Feb.  14, 2012, entitled METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR INTERACTIVE DATA MANAGEMENT USING AN APPLICATION PLUG-IN, both of which are
incorporated by reference herein.  By including the search functionality in a plugin, SPOTLIGHT (e.g., a system-wide desktop feature provided on MAC computer systems) may be supported in MAC, or corresponding features provided on Windows WINDOWS systems
for searches.  In general, plug-ins for various operating systems may be provided to allow searching directly through the operating system's search bar, which may include use of NLP as described herein, without the need to launch a specific browser or
standalone application.
<br/><br/> As noted previously, one aspect of the present invention relates to providing users with the capability to share content, such as finished reports, as well as specific graphs, charts, or other visually presented information, with other users,
such as coworkers.  This may be implemented as shown with respect to the example display 500 of FIG. 5.  For example, to share a report, a user may be provided with a menu or other interface option, such as Report menu option 520 (or similar or
equivalent option to select a report) to select a report.  The report may include various information including visualizations, such as visualization 532 and 534.
<br/><br/> The Report menu 520 may include various submenus 522, including a "share" sub-menu 523 that a user may select to share the report with other users, as well as other submenus, such as the various submenus shown in sub-menu 523.  A different
interface mechanism may be used to share visualizations or other information, such as visualizations 532 and 534.  This may be done by an attached "pop-up" menu or box, such as with pop-up window 620 as shown in FIG. 6A, which may be attached or
associated with a visualization 632 and may pop-up during certain user actions, such as moving a mouse cursor over or near the visualization.  An image, icon, or other representation of the chart/graph/report (or other visualization) may similarly be
presented to the user.  The pop-up window 620 may include a "share" icon 622 or other selection mechanism to initiate sharing of the visualization.
<br/><br/> In either the example shown in FIG. 5 or the example shown in FIG. 6A, once a user selects the share menu option, additional actions may be done, such as providing a menu or other input option to allow a user to enter a description or other
information, which may be presented to other users alongside the report/chart.  An example of such a window is shown in window 650 of FIG. 6B, where options such as a listing 653 of available users (who with to share), a description box 655 for entering
text, an image of the report/chart (or other visualization) 657, and/or other images or information (not shown) may be provided.
<br/><br/> After a user has filled in any required elements of window 650, the user may select the "OK" button or make a similar or equivalent selection, after which the chart/graph/report will be posted to the flow of any selected users.  An example of a
flow update box 712 illustrating how information may be posted to a selected user's flow is shown in display 700 of FIG. 7A.  For example, the presented information may include a description of the submitted information (e.g., a Report 710, a
Visualization 730, etc.), as well as an information box, such as information box 160 as shown in FIG. 1, which may include information such as the user's photo, avatar, icon, business card, etc., text or other information submitted by the user, such as
the information entered in the "Description" box of FIG. 6B, an icon or image 714 representing the report/chart, as well as other information (not shown).  A pop-up window or similar or equivalent interface element, such as pop-up window 730, may be
included to allow for addition user interaction, such as changing the parameters of reports (e.g., date or other ranges or scaling, maximizing sizing, or change other parameters of report or visualizations).  A similar presentation for Visualizations,
such as charts/graphs, is illustrated in display 750 of FIG. 7B.
<br/><br/> Some embodiments may include alerting functions, such as described in Related U.S.  Provisional Patent Application Ser.  No. 61/477,993, filed Apr.  21, 2011, entitled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR PREDICTIVE ALERTING, and in U.S.  Utility patent
application Ser.  No. 13/453,926, filed Apr.  23, 2012, entitled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR PREDICTIVE ALERTING, both of which are incorporated by reference herein.  Similar to Reports, Alerts may be sent to a set of users and may appear in the users' flow. For example, a first user may create an alert and it may be processed such as described in the '993 or the '926 applications, with the alert then included in users' flows based on occurrence of the underlying event or events controlling the alert.
<br/><br/> An example embodiment of an Alert Creation window 800 is shown in FIG. 8A.  A user may be provided with an interface 810 to enter alert controls and conditions, such as what is being monitored, how frequently, how notification may be done,
whether predictions of occurrence of the alerting condition(s) should be done, and/or other alert or monitoring criteria.  In addition, an interface 820 may be included to allow a user to select whether the alert response should be shared with other
users' flows.  These may be predefined groups of users such as Developers, Marketers, and/or other groups of users, and/or may be filtered users, which may be users selected based on properties or parameters associated with the users.
<br/><br/> When an alert is triggered, a post may then be generated in the selected users' flows.  An example of this is shown as post 850 of FIG. 8B.  Users that see the post may be able to subscribe or otherwise interact with the alert to that future
alerts may be presented to the users by email, voice message, or other communication methods.  An example Subscribe menu selection button 853 is shown in FIG. 8B.
<br/><br/> In addition to user generated or user controlled report presentation, in some embodiments, reports may be scheduled and automatically generated.  For example, in one embodiment, a report may be scheduled using an add-on application, such as the
add-on application to MICROSOFT EXCEL created by Anametrix, assignee of the instant application, for automating report creation.  For example, a report may have a predefined format and predefined scheduling to determine the frequency of refresh.  In the
existing Anametrix application, the refreshed report is sent by email to appropriate users.  In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a scheduled report may also be generated and published, such as to the flows of designated users.  An
embodiment of an example report scheduling window 900 is shown in FIG. 9A, including a publication selection option 910 (which may include menus or other selection options to select an appropriate group of users for receipt of the scheduled reports), as
well as a Description window 920 to allow users to enter text, such as described previously with respect to FIG. 6B.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9B illustrates a corresponding example post 950 to users' flow in response to generation of the scheduled report.  The post may include similar information to that described previously with respect to FIG. 8B, including Description and a
Subscription option.
<br/><br/> Another aspect of the present invention relates to interactive report generation and user interaction through users' flows.  Interactive reports are reports that allow multiple users to interact with the report and/or associated information. 
For example, FIG. 10A illustrates an example embodiment 1000 of an Interactive Report and Visualization.  When a report is published to users' flows, the users may be provided with an interface to comment on the report and/or on specific elements, such
as tables, visualizations, text, or other elements.  An example comments panel 1016 is shown, where users may provide comments elements of a report 1010 such as visualization 1012 (e.g. the "Ratio" pie chart), tabular information 1014 (e.g., the "Site
Traffic" table), or other elements (not shown).  The comments panel 1016 may include information associated with the commenting user, such as the element which is being commented on (e.g., Ratio, Site Traffic, Year, etc.), the user making the comment,
the time/date, as well as textual or graphically provided comments, data, or information.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10B illustrates a similar diagram 1050 for multiple user interaction through users' flows for a Visualization.  As shown in FIG. 10B, in addition to commenting on a report or specific report elements as shown in FIG. 10A, an interface
option may be provided to allow users to comment on specific elements, such as Visualization 1012 as shown.  This may be implemented by a pop-up menu 1062 or other user interface mechanism to allow a user to add a comment 1064 as shown.  The comments
displayed to other users within this interaction may be limited to comments related to the specifically selected element (e.g., Visualization 1012 in this example).
<br/><br/> Another aspect of the present invention relates to live reports.  Live reports are shared reports that provide for real time updating and/or interaction.  FIG. 11 illustrates an example embodiment of a live report window 1100 for interaction
with report 1110, which includes Visualization 1112, Table 1114, Comments panel 1116, as well as an Active Users panel 1140.  One user may be allowed to actively edit, update, change parameters of (e.g., date, scaling, etc.) or other information
associated with the report and/or with specific elements such as Visualization 1112 or Table 1114, while other users receive and can view the updates in real time.  The Active Users panel 1140 may be provided to each active user to monitor which others
are also interacting with the report.  In addition, interaction may be provided through use of an audio connection, such as through use of a microphone, and/or a video connection, such as through use of a webcam.  This information may be audibly and/or
visually presented to all users capable of audio or video interaction.  In the example shown in FIG. 11, four users are interacting (e.g., the user who is receiving window 1100, as well as Persons 1-3).  Person #2 is actively communicating (as shown by
the microphone icon) with Person #1 and Person #3.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 illustrates details of an embodiment 1200 of a Social Analytics system.  System 1200 may include a core element of a server system 1210, which may include one or more servers, as well as associated components such as databases, network
interfaces, displays, and other related computer system components.  Server system 1210 may be a single system or may be implemented as a distributed system spanning multiple physical areas and multiple physical computing components.
<br/><br/> Multiple users 1280 may be provided with controlled access to system 1210, such as via wired networks, wireless networks, the Internet, or via other communication connections.  Each user may interact with system 1210 using a standard web
browser, however, in some implementations a plug-in or standalone application may be executed, in whole or in part, on the user systems 1280.  As described previously, multiple users 1280 may interact using a Social Analytics interface such as shown in
FIG. 1.  For example, a user on User System 1 (1280-1) may interact, via a user interface such as shown in FIG. 1, with users on User System 2 and User System 3 (and/or with other users on other systems not shown).
<br/><br/> Within server system 1210, one or more processors 120 may be coupled to one or more analytics databases 1240, which may contain shared objects 1242, such as reports, visualizations, tables, etc. Users may interact with system 1210 via one or
more networking interfaces 1230 to implement the functions described herein, including providing user communications, report distribution, live report updating, and other user interactions over the social analytics network.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 illustrates details of an embodiment of a process 1300 for providing interactive editing and reporting on a social analytics system, such as described previously with respect to FIG. 11.  At stage 1310, a report, which may be generated
automatically or by one or more users, may be stored on a Social Analytics system, such as the system shown in FIG. 12.  At stage 1315, the report may be accessed by a first user (e.g., User 1) via a web browser such as shown in FIG. 12, or via a
standalone application or plug-in to an existing application.  At stage 1320, the user may edit/update or otherwise interact with the report, and the updated report may be periodically provided to other users at stage 1325 (e.g., to a second user, User
2, and/or to other users).
<br/><br/> At decision stage 1330, a decision may be made as to whether the report editing/updating is completed.  This may be initiated by an action from User 1, such as by indicating completion of editing and "checking-in" the report.  If editing is not
completed, processing may return to stage 1320 for further editing/updating.  Once editing is completed, the report may then be available at stage 1340 for other users to access/edit.  Upon access by other users, process 1300 may be repeated.  Additional
functions, such as providing user comments associated with the object(s) being edited as described previously herein, may also be implemented in conjunction with process 1300.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 illustrates details of an embodiment of a process 1400 for interactive editing of an object such as a report or visualization on a Social Analytics system.  At stage 1410, a report may be generated based on business analytics
information, such as automatically as described previously herein or by one or more users.  The report may be stored at stage 1415 in a database of a Social Analytics system, such as database 1240 of FIG. 12.  A first user (User 1) may be provided with
controlled access to the report at stage 1418, such as for editing, updating, etc. At stage 1420, a real time display of the report may be provided to a second user (User 2), and the Social Analytics system may receive input from User 1 at stage 1425
related to an edit or change to the report or other object.  At stage 1430, updated information, responsive to the edit/change at stage 1425, may be provided to User 2 so that the information on a user interface display may be updated.  At a decision
stage 1440, a decision may be made as to whether editing is completed.  If not, processing may return to stage 1420 and be repeated.  Alternately, if processing is completed, the report or other interactive object may be made available to other users at
stage 1450.  The report or other interactive object may be stored at stage 1455.  Additional functions, such as providing user comments associated with the object(s) being edited as described previously herein, may also be implemented in conjunction with
process 1400.
<br/><br/> FIG. 15 illustrates details of an embodiment of a process 1500 for interactive editing of an object with real time sharing on a Social Analytics system.  At stage 1510, information defining a user interface, such as the user interface 100 shown
in FIG. 1, may be received at a computer or other device of a first user for rendering on the first user's display.  At stage 1515, the information may be displayed to the first user, including an object, such as a report or visualization, for editing by
the first user.  At stage 1520, the first user may edit the object, such as by interacting with the user interface to change or update the object, and the updating information may be sent at stage 1525 to a Social Networking system in communication with
the first user.
<br/><br/> At stage 1530 and 1535, the first user may interactive edit/update the object, and the editing/updating information may correspondingly be provided to the Social Analytics system (where it may further be shared with other users).  At stage 1540,
a second user (and/or other users) may provide comments on the updating/editing of the object, which may then be provided from the Social Analytics system to the first user.  The comments may then be displayed on the user interface of the first user
(and/or in a comments panel of the other users).
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 illustrates details of an embodiment of a process 1600 for providing interactive editing of an object such as a report or visualization with real time sharing on a Social Analytics system.  At stage 1610, a user may receive information
defining a user interface, such as interface 100 as shown in FIG. 1, to render the interface on a second user's display.  At stage 1620, the interface may be displayed on the user's display, including a display of a first object, such as a report or a
visualization, being edited/updated by a first user.  At stage 1630, information defining an update to the first object may be received, such as information describing an updated first object to be displayed to the second user.  At stage 1640, the
updated object may then be displayed to the second user in real time based on the first user's edits.  Additional information, comments, or other communication (such as by webcam, audio, text, etc.) may be further combined with process 1600 to facilitate
user interaction as described previously herein.
