       <p> A method and apparatus for receiving an image associated with an
     interactive service on at least one social media server, the image
     belonging to a group of images. The image is stored and accessing of the
     image by a user is detected. In response, a request with an
     identification of the image is sent to a back-end server to access the
     interactive service. Interaction messages are exchanged with the
     interactive service so that the interactive service associated with the
     image is made available to users by accessing the image.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 shows a flow chart of a method according to an example embodiment illustrating operations at a back-end server.  The method comprises following main steps:
<br/><br/> 110 Storing a group of images, e.g. when a user uploads the image to the back-end server.  The group may comprise one or more images e.g. of similar subjects.  For instance, the images of the group can represent a new album of a rock star, the
rock star and/or various associated items such as music videos and books.
<br/><br/> 120 Associating the group of images image with an interactive service on at least one social media server.  This can be done, for instance, by the user defining actions to be associated with the image.
<br/><br/> 130 Making the group of images available to a plurality of image publishers.  For instance, the image can be distributed in a variety of different blogs, emails, advertisements of electric distributions, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> posts or even printed
publications such as magazines or posters.
<br/><br/> 140 Receiving from a requesting apparatus a request to access the interactive service associated with the group of images.  The requesting apparatus is a term that can refer to, for instance, a content server or a user terminal with which a user
photographs a printed image of the group of images and interacts with the back-end server.  In some embodiments, the request comprises an identification of the location of a given image of the group of images on the content server.  The location
information enables determining the sources of requests to the interactive service based on the given image and thus enables providing of valuable further services.
<br/><br/> 150 Exchanging interaction messages between the requesting apparatus and the interactive service so that the interactive service associated with the group of images is made available to users of any of the plurality of image publishers by
accessing any image of the group of images.
<br/><br/> In practice, the operation of the content server or user terminal can be conveniently controlled by providing a suitable script with one or more actions associated with the group of images.  The script can be obtained, for instance, from the
back-end server by using the identifier of the image to identify a script with desired actions associated with the group of images.
<br/><br/> The interactive service can be associated with a given spot on an image, i.e. hotspot.  The interaction service can then be accessed by a user by accessing the given spot on the image.  The hotspots can be individually located on different
images of the group of images.  Alternatively, the hotspots can be aligned e.g. by an image object recognition software configured to detect potentially distinguishing parts in the images.  Further alternatively, the hotspots can be aligned according to
a predetermined matrix or other grouping.
<br/><br/> The images of the group of images can be associated with an image identifier.  The given spot can also or alternatively be associated with an image spot identifier.  In some embodiments, the image spot identifier and the image identifier may
collectively define the image and the given spot of the image.  Alternatively, the image spot identifier can be capable of uniquely identifying the image and the given spot on the image.  The image identifier and/or the image spot identifier can further
alternatively uniquely identify the group of images.
<br/><br/> The image identifier and image spot identifier, when present, are stored by the back-end server that further distributes the identifiers to entities in need of them.  In one example embodiment, the identifiers are delivered as attached to the
images.  This can be simply done by using metadata of image files and/or by using watermarking in which technique information is coded into the images themselves such that the difference is not perceivable by a human being but can be decoded by a
computer.
<br/><br/> At least one of the interaction messages may comprise the image identifier.  Alternatively, or additionally, at least one of the interaction messages may comprise the image spot identifier.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, the interactive service comprises a commenting functionality configured to enable users to post comments.
<br/><br/> The interactive service comprises in one example embodiment a ranking functionality.  The ranking functionality in one embodiment enables a user to vote e.g. by liking or disliking content in the interactive service.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 shows a flow diagram of a method according to another example embodiment at a content server or user terminal.  The method comprises following main steps:
<br/><br/> 210 Receiving an image associated with an interactive service on at least one social media server, the image belonging to a group of images.  In case of a content server, the image can be received from an uploading user, for instance.  In case
of the user terminal, the image can be e.g. a printed image that the user can photograph.  Once optically read into the user terminal, the user terminal can perform, according to an example embodiment, a feature analysis that results in fingerprints of
the image based on which the image can be recognized.  In another embodiment, the printed image is supplemented with a machine readable code such as a bar code or near field communications code that provides the user terminal with the image identifier or
its derivative.
<br/><br/> 220 Storing the image.
<br/><br/> 230 Detecting accessing of the image by a user (e.g. idle or perform other tasks until the user has accessed the image) and responsively:
<br/><br/> 240 Sending to a back-end server a request to access the interactive service, the request comprising an identification of the image.  This request can be triggered by user action such as clicking a hotspot on the image by a user of a content
server or by the user taking an image of a printed image or issuing a command through a user interface of the user terminal.  The request comprises, in an example embodiment, an identification of the location of the image on a content server.
<br/><br/> 250 Exchanging interaction messages with the interactive service so that the interactive service associated with the image is made available to users by accessing the image.
<br/><br/> An example embodiment further comprises receiving from a back-end server a script and storing the script.  Access to the image can be detected by the script.
<br/><br/> The script can be used also or alternatively for sending to a back-end server an identification of the location of the accessed image on the content server and a request to access the interactive service.  Further additionally or alternatively,
the script can be used to cause the exchanging interaction messages with the interactive service.
<br/><br/> The image fingerprint mentioned above can be specific for the entire accessed image or to the respective group of images.  Alternatively, different objects in the image can be represented by individual fingerprints so as to discover use of a
cropped part of an image such as a person appearing in the image.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, the identification of the image is formed based on the one or more fingerprints.  The forming of the identification of the image can be made e.g. by querying for the identification with a query request comprising the
one or more fingerprints.  Alternatively, the identification of the image can be formed from the one or more fingerprints.  The fingerprints can be, for instance, combined using a concatenation operation.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 shows a block diagram of a first server 300 suited to operate as a back-end server.  The first server 300 comprises a processor 310, a memory 320 including a work memory 330 and persistent memory 340 that comprises software 350 i.e.
computer executable program code using which the processor 310 can control the operations of the first server 300.  The processor can comprise, for instance, a central processing unit, a digital signal processor, or a cluster of central processing units. The work memory 330 can comprise, for instance, random access memory, SDRAM, DIMM modules, or any other rewriteable memory.  The persistent memory 340 can comprise, for example, an optical storage medium, a magnetic storage medium, a hard disk, and/or a
solid state disk.  The first server 300 further comprises a communication interface 360 for exchanging information with other entities over one or more communication channels such as packet data networks, mobile communication networks, satellite
networks, proprietary communication links and circuit switched channels.  A user interface 370 is optionally provided.  The first server 300 further comprises an image database 380 that comprises image identifiers, associated scripts or instructions
regarding actions associated with images or hotspots on the images.  The first server 300 further comprises a user database 390 comprising user accounts and access rights to the image database.  The access rights specify which users can modify which
records of the image database.  For instance, each user can be allowed to upload images or associated information to the image database 380 and later modify the uploaded images and the associated information.  The content servers can be made to
respectively update the images stored therein if any changes have been made by the user to images.
<br/><br/> While FIG. 3 makes a formal distinction between the image database 380 and the user database 390, these databases can be formed using a single database or split into more databases.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 shows a block diagram of a second server 400 suited to operate as a content server according to an example embodiment.  FIG. 4 is otherwise corresponding to FIG. 3 except that FIG. 4 lacks the databases of FIG. 3 and that FIG. 3 shows
software 350' that is configured for the second server 400.  Hence, FIG. 4 needs no further description as the functional blocks of FIG. 4 operate like those in FIG. 3.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 shows a block diagram of an apparatus 500 suited to operate as a user terminal according to an example embodiment.  FIG. 5 has blocks corresponding to those in FIG. 4 except that additionally, FIG. 5 shows a battery 510 for mobile use and
a different version of the software with reference sign 350''.  It is also understood that for mobile use, the user terminal 500 can be built using power-efficient and lightweight components whereas in server use, mobility and weight is not an issue. 
Hence, the mass memory, for instance, can be e.g. a flash memory or replaceable memory card such as a micro-SD memory card, although there are also very light and compact hard disks that are well suited for mobile use.
<br/><br/> It should be understood that the user terminal can be made in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and for a multitude of different other purposes as well.  The user terminal can be adapted to function as a laptop computer, mobile telephone,
