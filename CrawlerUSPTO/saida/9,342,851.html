<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying figures, which form a part hereof.  In the figures, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise.  The illustrative
embodiments described in the detailed description, figures, and claims are not meant to be limiting.  Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented herein.  It
will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the Figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of
which are explicitly contemplated herein.
<br/><br/> This disclosure may describe, inter alia, systems and methods of filtering content of one or more social networks for a desired result.  Additional methods may be provided to configure different heuristics by topic to enable filtering by a user. In one example, default heuristics may be provided for music, television, movies, books and radio.  In other examples, users may customize filtering based on preferences.  Still additional methods may be provided to configure views, comments, and ratings
on a social network, as well as to enable playback and/or purchase of filtered content via the social network.
<br/><br/> I. Example Social Networks
<br/><br/> Any number of digital communication or social networks may be used, accessed, or processed to obtain a data set.  A social network may include an online service, platform, or website that allows building and reflecting of social relations among
people, e.g., who share interests and/or activities.  Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, activities, events, and interests within their individual networks.  As such, social network services may be web-based (or Internet based) and
provide for users to interact over the Internet, such as e-mail and instant messaging.  In some examples, social network services may include an individual-centered service or an online community service (e.g., group-centered).  Example social network
services include Facebook.RTM., Twitter.RTM., MySpace.RTM., LinkedIn.RTM.  , Nexopia.RTM., Bebo.RTM., and Hi5.RTM..  Others exist as well.
<br/><br/> A social network website may include a representation of each user (often a profile), his/her social links, and a variety of additional services.  For example, a social network may operate, for example, using a network of servers that host
websites allowing users to create personal profiles, add other users as friends, exchange messages including automatic notifications when a user updates a profile, communicate with friends and other users through private or public messages and chat
features, etc.
<br/><br/> Social networking services may include category based services (such as former school-year or classmates), services to connect with friends (usually with self-description pages), and recommendations of systems linked to trust.  For example,
users of a social network may join common interest user groups, organized by workplace, school, or college, or other characteristics.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram showing components of an example device 100 that may be used to connect or otherwise communicate with a social network.  In practice, some of these components or their functions may be distributed across
multiple devices.  However, the components are shown and described as part of a representative device for sake of example.  The device may be or include a wireless computing device, a wireless telephone device, a personal computer, a personal digital
assistant, etc., or a combination of such devices, or may be configured to have a combination of functions of such devices.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 1, the device 100 includes a communication interface 102, a user interface 104, a processor 106, and data storage 108, all of which may be communicatively linked together by a system bus, network, or other connection mechanism
110.
<br/><br/> The communication interface 102 may function to allow the device 100 to communicate with access networks and/or transport networks so as to facilitate calling, social-network interaction, and implementation of example methods described herein. 
For instance, the communication interface 102 may include a chipset and antenna arranged for wireless communication with a radio access network such as a radio access network (RAN) that may provide connectivity with one or more other entities, such as to
facilitate calling and/or social-network interaction.  Alternatively or additionally, the communication interface 102 may include a telephone or Ethernet interface arranged to couple with a landline or wireless connection, that provides connectivity with
one or more transports to similarly facilitate calling and/or social-network interaction.
<br/><br/> The user interface 104 may function to allow the device 100 to interact with a first party or user, such as to receive input from the first party and to provide output to the first party.  As such, the user interface 104 may include input

<br/><br/> II.  Example Filtering of Social Network Activity
<br/><br/> Example embodiments provide a method for aggregating and filtering social network activity by topic of online relationships, as established by the digital communication and social networks, for a specific person.  An individual may authenticate
with their network(s) to give a filter system access to activity of their online relationships in entirety.  A data set can be aggregated from the individual's social network of activity (e.g., online relationships), and can be aggregated across multiple
networks if applicable.  Aggregation may be performed based on the authentication and permissions granted by the specific communication and social networks per user.
<br/><br/> The social network of activity may be generated by a user's connections or a group of user's connections on the social network.  The activity may comprise individual data units, often termed "posts", "updates" or "status messages", hereafter
referred to as posts.  The posts can be evaluated individually as to their applicability to a specific topic, such as, by processing content of the posts.
<br/><br/> Posts can be aggregated and parsed for identification of activity by topic; for example, activity related to music, TV, movies, books, radio or other types as defined in the system.  The data parsing can be based on a range of characteristics,
or based on any number of evaluation criteria.  The evaluation criteria may include evaluating a network origin of content of the post, a source of the post, a contributing application of content of the post (if applicable), an individual's relationship
to a contributor of the post, and a preference set by the individual for a given characteristic/relationship/network, for example.  Other criteria includes evaluating based on a media types used in content of the post (e.g., media types include text
files, music files, other media files, etc.), key words used in content of the post or other content within the activity data itself such as text, audio, video, or images, an entity (individual, company, etc) who composed the post (entity who input
content of the post or an identification of an application or software that input content of the post), URLs linked to from the post or included within content of the post, meta-data included in content of the post or connected to the post, and an
originating device type (e.g., mobile phone) used to enter content of the post, for example.
<br/><br/> Example embodiments enable configuration of any number of evaluation criteria to process social network activity.  Combinations of the above criteria may determine a filter result for a given topic.  A processor may analyze each of individual
posts in a user's social network to filter the posts based on selected criteria.
<br/><br/> As an example, a "music filter" may be configured to filter content from any of: Posts from source applications that are concerned with music (e.g., Spotify) Posts with audio files media types, possible in conjunction with specific keyword(s)
Posts with music related keywords (e.g. "music", "song") Posts input by musical artists, record companies, labels, etc. Posts that contain URLs linking to music websites (e.g., Last.fm) Posts that include <b><i>Facebook</i></b> Open Graph XML IDs of the type "song" or
"artist" Posts originating from online connected radios (e.g., Squeezebox) Filters may be customized based on any number of evaluation criteria.  In addition, pre-configured filters may be provided for music, television, movies, books and radio, for
example.
<br/><br/> As another example, a music filter may be configured to filter content from any posts that are made by or linked to a music application (e.g., Pandora.RTM., etc.), that include music media in the post (e.g., music file, video), that include any
music keywords (e.g., album titles, song names), that are made by a music artist, that include URLs linking to music related domains, etc. Each individual post of a user's social network can be analyzed to apply the criteria to determine if the post
qualifies as being musically related.
<br/><br/> To filter the posts, content within the posts may be parsed and filtered using semantic filters, for example.  In addition, search engines may be used to identify whether content in a post matches to criteria set for filtering.  In this regard,
media search engines may be provided and may include or have access to databases that index media streams, for example, to compare the content in the posts with the stored information so as to identify media associated with the posts.
<br/><br/> Still further, content within the posts may be compared to content within a database that contains lists of information that qualifies according to a specific filter.  For example, the database may contain a list of all qualifying music related
applications, a database of music artists, song titles, album titles, music related URLs, etc., and posts may be processed by accessing the database and searching for content that matches content contained within the post.
<br/><br/> As specific examples, a user may to authenticate to Facebook.RTM.  and Twitter.RTM.  (e.g., login) and filter post content to view: all television related posts from their connections, movie related posts from their friends and movie trailers
associated with the post content, and which of their friends are fans and/or reading books by a particular author, for example.  In addition, users may authenticate to a social network and input a post indicating that they are watching a specific TV
show, and then filter posts to identify which of their friends are also watching the same show.
<br/><br/> Still further, a user may designate specific friends on a social network as music influencers relative to their other friends such that their posts are prioritized higher when viewing.  Users may also comment on and rate the musical and TV
tastes of their friends.
<br/><br/> The posts can be displayed according to the filters.  Example embodiments enable a user to view all music related information about friends on social networks.  A given user can see activity of friends, and using filters, can view musically
related posts, for example.  A user can then be presented with an aggregated and filtered view of data for perusal, commenting, rating, playback, purchase and other actions.
<br/><br/> In addition, a user may maintain relationships and connections across multiple social networks and may desire a unified view of a search result.  Example embodiments provide for aggregating facilities to achieve the desired result.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 shows a flowchart of an example method 300 for filtering social network activity.  Method 300 shown in FIG. 3 presents an embodiment of a method that, for example, could be used with the device or system shown in FIG. 1-2.  Method 300 may
include one or more operations, functions, or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks 302-308.  Although the blocks are illustrated in a sequential order, these blocks may also be performed in parallel, and/or in a different order than those
described herein.  Also, the various blocks may be combined into fewer blocks, divided into additional blocks, and/or removed based upon the desired implementation.
<br/><br/> It should be understood that for this and other processes and methods disclosed herein, the flowchart shows functionality and operation of one possible implementation of present embodiments.  In this regard, each block may represent a module, a
segment, or a portion of program code, which includes one or more instructions executable by a processor for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the process.  The program code may be stored on any type of computer readable medium or data
storage, for example, such as a storage device including a disk or hard drive.  The computer readable medium may include non-transitory computer readable medium or memory, for example, such as computer-readable media that stores data for short periods of
time like register memory, processor cache and Random Access Memory (RAM).  The computer readable medium may also include non-transitory media, such as secondary or persistent long term storage, like read only memory (ROM), optical or magnetic disks,
compact-disc read only memory (CD-ROM), for example.  The computer readable media may also be any other volatile or non-volatile storage systems.  The computer readable medium may be considered a tangible computer readable storage medium, for example.
<br/><br/> In addition, each block in FIG. 3 may represent circuitry that is wired to perform the specific logical functions in the process.
<br/><br/> At block 302, the method 300 includes receiving content posted to a social network and associated with a user profile.  The social network may comprise a network of users that are related via one or more relationships indicating a type of
connection between respective users, and the content posted to the social network includes a plurality of distinct data sets.  As one example, the social network may include Facebook.RTM., and the distinct data sets may include respective posts to a wall
of a user, an update to a post, or a status message.
<br/><br/> At block 304, the method 300 includes processing the plurality of distinct data sets to identify one or more respective data sets being indicative of media content.  As an example, a post to a social network may include a title of a song, lyrics
of a song, a sample of a song/tv show, etc., and may be identified as indicative of media content.  The data sets may be processed by performing semantic recognition of text of the data sets, or performing a content identification of the content.  The
data sets may be processed by providing content of the data sets to a content recognition server or search engine, and receiving from the content recognition server or search engine a listing of data sets that are indicative of media content.
<br/><br/> At block 306, the method 300 includes filtering the one or more respective data sets based on a type of media content indicated by the one or more respective data sets.  As an example, the data sets may be filtered based on types of media
content including songs, television, movies, books, etc.
<br/><br/> As one example, the data sets may be filtered by comparing the content of the data sets with stored information so as to identify media associated with the one or more data sets.  The stored information may include stored recordings of songs,
movies, or television shows.
<br/><br/> As another example, the method 300 may include filtering data sets based on a priority associated with designated related users of the social network.  A designed related user may be associated with a type of media content, such as music, and
when content is posted by the designated user, the content may be filtered according to a music filter.
<br/><br/> In some examples, block 306 may further include receiving a selection of a predetermined filter from a group of predetermined filters.  A predetermined filter may be configured to process content based on one or more of a source application of
the content, a media type of the content, and keywords of the content, or other predetermined configurations.
<br/><br/> At block 308, the method 300 includes providing within the social network for the user profile the content in an order based on the filtering.  As an example, the content may be grouped into respective group data sets based on the order, and
provided in the social network in groups.  The content may be provided in the social network by generating a display or displaying the content accordingly.
<br/><br/> As further examples, the content may be processed based on a network origin of the content, based on a contributing application of the posted content, based on a media type of the posted content, based on text of the posted content, or based on
an originating device type used to provide the posted content (e.g., mobile or desktop computer).  The content can then be provided in the social network in an order based on the processing.
<br/><br/> In one example, the method 300 may be performed across a single social network.  In other examples, the method 300 may be performed across multiple social networks.  For instance, content posted to multiple social networks can be received and
filtered, and a display of aggregated content posted to the multiple social networks can be provided to display the aggregated content in an order based on the filtering.
<br/><br/> III.  Example Content Identification within Social Network Activity
<br/><br/> In additional embodiments, information within posts may be associated with certain content, and the content can be identified and/or provided to a user.  For example, information within a post may be associated with a song.  The system may
identify the song, based on song title, album title, artist, lyrics of the song, etc., by accessing a database of songs, artists, lyrics, etc. The system may then associate a copy of the song (e.g., media file) with the post to allow a user to preview or
purchase the song.
<br/><br/> In other examples, the system may allow the user to associate the song or add the song to a list of songs maintained by the user, such as a list of songs "tagged" by the user using content identification services, such as provided by Shazam
Entertainment in London, United Kingdom, Gracenote in Emeryville, Calif., or Melodis in San Jose, Calif., for example, that may operate to receive samples of environmental audio, identify a musical content of the audio sample, and provide the user with
information about the music, including the track name, artist, album, artwork, biography, discography, concert tickets, etc.
<br/><br/> As such, the system may identify media related to or identified within the posts, and provide or associate other information with the posts based on the identified media.  Thus, the system may access a media stream library database to select
media associated with or corresponding to content within a post that may then be provided to the user or rendered by the system.  Databases may be provided that include media recordings and each recording may be identified by a unique identifier (e.g.,
sound_ID).  The database may not store audio or video files for each recording, since the sound_IDs can be used to retrieve audio files from elsewhere.  However, the database may store the audio or video files in some examples.  The database may also
include information for each stored audio, video, or media file, or for each stored media index.  For example, metadata may be stored with each file that indicates information about the file, such as an artist name, a length of song, lyrics of the song,
time indices for lines or words of the lyrics, album artwork, graphics/images to display for the song or while the song is playing, or any other identifying or related information to the file.
<br/><br/> Various content identification techniques are known in the art for performing computational content identifications of media samples and features of media samples using a database of media tracks.  The following U.S.  Patents and publications
describe possible examples for media recognition techniques, and each is entirely incorporated herein by reference, as if fully set forth in this description: Kenyon et al, U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,843,562, entitled "Broadcast Information Classification System
and Method"; Kenyon, U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,450,531, entitled "Broadcast Signal Recognition System and Method"; Haitsma et al, U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0263360, entitled "Generating and Matching Hashes of Multimedia Content"; Wang and
Culbert, U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,627,477, entitled "Robust and Invariant Audio Pattern Matching"; Wang, Avery, U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0143777, entitled "Method and Apparatus for Identification of Broadcast Source"; Wang and Smith, U.S. 
Pat.  No. 6,990,453, entitled "System and Methods for Recognizing Sound and Music Signals in High Noise and Distortion"; Blum, et al, U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,918,223, entitled "Method and Article of Manufacture for Content-Based Analysis, Storage, Retrieval,
and Segmentation of Audio Information"; and Master, et al, U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0145708, entitled "System and Method for Identifying Original Music".
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 shows a flowchart of an example method 400 for providing additional information within the social network based on social network activity.  Method 400 shown in FIG. 4 presents an embodiment of a method that, for example, could be used
with the device or system shown in FIG. 1-2.  Method 400 may include one or more operations, functions, or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks 402-410.  Although the blocks are illustrated in a sequential order, these blocks may also be
performed in parallel, and/or in a different order than those described herein.  Also, the various blocks may be combined into fewer blocks, divided into additional blocks, and/or removed based upon the desired implementation.
<br/><br/> At block 402, the method 400 includes receiving content posted to a social network and associated with a user profile, and block 404 includes processing the plurality of distinct data sets to identify one or more respective data sets being
indicative of media content.  Blocks 402 and 404 may be similar to blocks 302 and 304 of FIG. 3, for example.
<br/><br/> At block 406, the method 400 includes providing content of the one or more respective data sets to a content identification system.
<br/><br/> At block 408, the method 400 includes receiving from the content identification system information associated with an identity of the content.  In one example, the information associated with the identity of the content includes one or more of
an identity of the content, a media sample of the content, and lyrics of the content.
<br/><br/> At block 410, the method 400 includes providing within the social network for the user profile the information associated with the identity of the content.  As an example, the content may include a sample of a media stream being rendered by a
media rendering source, and the information received from the content identification system may indicate an identity of a recording corresponding to the sample.  Thus, the information indicating the identity of the recording may be provided within the
social network for the user profile.
<br/><br/> As another example, the content may include lyrics of a song, a sample of media corresponding to the song may be received from the content identification system.  Thus, the sample of the media may be provided within the social network for the
user profile.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5A is a conceptual illustration of an example social-network page 500 of a user profile.  The social-network page 500 may represent a unique area that may be associated with one or more social-networks and may also be associated with the
user profile.  Thus, a page may include an area within the social-network or a social-network website.
<br/><br/> The social-network page 500 of FIG. 5A is shown to include a variety of data including groups 502, a news data feed 504, and posts 506.  All or part of the data in the social-network page 500 may be logged or otherwise stored in a database and
associated with the user profile.
<br/><br/> The social-network page 500 includes posts 506 of various content.  For example, John Doe has posted lyrics of a song, John Music has posted an update indicating at a music concert with friends, Jane Smith has posted an update indicating at pool
swimming, and Jane Doe has posted a multimedia sample (audio or video).
<br/><br/> FIG. 5B is a conceptual illustration of the example social-network page 500 after filtering of data and providing information as described in either or both of methods in FIGS. 3-4.  As shown in FIG. 5B, all posts not related to any type of
media content have been removed, and thus, the post from Jane Smith indicating at pool swimming has been removed.  In addition, each of the posts including content related to a type of media have been filtered and additional information has been
provided.  As examples, a sample of the song has been provided along with the lyrics of the song for the post by John Doe, a link to tickets available for the concert has been provided along with the post by John Smith, and a song title, artist, album
has been provided along with the multimedia sample with the post by Jane Doe.
