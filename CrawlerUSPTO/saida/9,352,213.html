       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> An augmented reality (AR) game system is disclosed wherein real-world
     objects are transformed into AR terrain elements and AR events generate
     real-world impact. The game environment is set up using real-world
     objects that include everyday objects and game pieces on a field of play.
     When viewed on the screen of a computing device executing the modules of
     the game system, the everyday objects are transformed into elements of an
     AR terrain while the game pieces can be augmented with various controls.
     Multiple viewing modes, for example, a third person view, a first person
     view or "POV" view from a selected game piece or a split screen view are
     contemplated for viewing the field of play. A subset of the augmented
     controls can be activated by the user to execute AR events some of which
     can have real-world impact. The AR events are executed based on game
     rules.

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Toys can provide both entertainment and education to children.  Various toys that include dolls and action figurines made of wood, stone and clay were used since Roman and Egyptian times.  Painted dolls and soldiers evolved in the 18.sup.th
century which led to the development of modern day "photo-realistic" plastic figurines.  Many hobbyists even collect figurines associated with particular characters or themes such as G.I.  Joe.  While stand-alone figurines allow children to use their
imagination to make up their own games, figurines can also form part of more structured play like, board games and war games that involve strategy.  Many board games however, have complex rules which demand great concentration and memory from the
players.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Different embodiments disclosed herein relate to systems and methods that facilitate augmented reality gaming for players.  Embodiments permit a player to interact with game pieces and real world objects, that when viewed through a computing
device configured for game play, appear visually different.  The computing device, among other functions, scans the field of play, determines game rules are being followed, and can send and receive signals to and from game pieces, and/or implement user
entered instructions, to control the appearance, behavior, position, motion, capabilities and/or physical integrity of game pieces and other real world objects in the field of play.
<br/><br/> A method of implementing an AR game system is disclosed in one embodiment.  The method comprises identifying, by a processor of a computing device, a field of play that includes a plurality of physical objects.  Physical game pieces are
differentiated from other field of play objects in the plurality of physical objects placed within the field of play.  The field of play is displayed by the processor as a terrain for an AR (Augmented Reality) game on a display screen.  Each of the field
of play objects is displayed with a virtual appearance that differs from its appearance in the real world.  The placements of the plurality of physical objects within the field of play are checked to determine if they comport with game rules.  If they do
not comport with the game rules, the processor provides feedback to a user of the computing device so that the placements can be adjusted to comport with the game rules.  When the processor determines that the placement of the plurality of physical
objects comport with the game rules, it signals the user that the AR game may be commenced.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, an image of at least one of the physical game pieces shown on the display screen is augmented with at least one additional virtual control that can be activated by a user input.  In some embodiments, the activation of the
additional virtual control causes a physical change to the at least one physical game piece.  In some embodiments, activation of the virtual control causes a change in another game piece.  In some embodiments, the processor can be configured to execute a
graphic animation upon the activation of the virtual control in addition to causing a physical change to the other game piece.  The other physical game piece(s) can be located in physical proximity to the at least one physical game piece or in a
geographic location that is remote from the location of at least one physical game piece.  Thus players of the game need not be co-located.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, at least one of the physical objects placed in the field of play is an unknown object and the processor is configured to display the unknown object as an element of the terrain in the AR game.  If the unknown object does not
comport with the game rules, the processor instructs the user to replace the unknown object.  Moreover, the image of is not augmented or remains unchanged if the unknown object does not comport with the game rules.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the physical game pieces are known to the processor via respective identifiers and when a new game piece is added to the field of play, a signal is received from the new game piece for registering its identifier with the
processor.  Upon registration, the processor displays an augmented image of the new game piece within the terrain of the AR game.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a plurality of options related to the AR game are provided by the processor for user selection.  When the user selection of one of the plurality of options is received by the processor, it overlays the terrain associated
with the user selected option on the field of play.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a user selection of one of the physical game pieces is received by the processor for generation of a point of view display and the point of view display of the terrain presenting positions of the physical game pieces in the
field of play based on a perspective of the selected physical game piece is generated and displayed on a screen of the computing device.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the processor further transmits a signal to affect an attribute of one or more of an element in the virtual environment or one or more of the physical game pieces at a predetermined time point(s) in the AR game.  In some
embodiments, the time point can be determined relative to the progress of the game or based on time elapsed since the occurrence of particular events or calculated based on one or more of the foregoing.  In some embodiments, the affected attributes can
be one or more of the physical or virtual attributes (by way of non-limiting example the deterioration of a playing field as a result of virtual rain or snow or the repeated passage of game pieces).  For each attribute that is affected, the extent to
which it is affected can be calculated in some embodiments.  For example, if the attribute is affected in response to a game event, the extent to which the attribute is affected can depend on the intensity of the event.  Thus, the extent of change in an
attribute can be calculated based on the characteristics of the event that caused the change.  In an embodiment, the signal is transmitted without user input.
<br/><br/> An apparatus comprising at least one processor and a storage medium for tangibly storing thereon program logic for execution by the processor is disclosed in one embodiment.  The program logic executed by the processor comprises, field
identifying logic for identifying a field of play for placement of a plurality of physical objects and game piece identifying logic for identifying physical game pieces among the plurality of physical objects placed within the field of play so as to
differentiate between the game pieces and the field of play objects.  Displaying logic is executed by the processor, for visibly displaying on a display screen of the apparatus, the field of play as a terrain for an AR (Augmented Reality) game, wherein
each of the field of play objects is displayed with a virtual appearance that differs from an appearance of the field of play object in the real world.  The processor executes determining for determining if placements of the plurality of physical objects
comport with game rules.  Feedback logic, is executed by the processor, for providing feedback to a user of the apparatus if the placements or attempted actions or moves do not comport with the game rules and if the placement of the plurality of physical
objects comport with the game rules, signaling logic is executed by the processor, for signaling to the user that the AR game may be commenced.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, feedback logic can also provide feedback to the users regarding the moves they execute in a game.  For example, at a given turn during the game, the feedback logic can provide feedback regarding the moves the user can make
from the current position or the capabilities of the game piece the user selected to make the move.  In some embodiments, the feedback logic can provide information to a user regarding the capabilities of a selected game piece.  In some embodiments, the
feedback logic can provide information to the user regarding the special rules associated with particular game instances, events or other game entities as will be detailed further herein.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, augmenting logic is executed by the processor, for augmenting an image of at least one of the physical game pieces shown on the display screen with at least one additional virtual control.  The processor also executes input
receiving logic for receiving user input to activate the additional virtual control, wherein the activation of the additional virtual control causes a physical change to the at least one physical game piece, animation logic, for displaying a graphic
animation upon the activation of the additional virtual control and change logic for causing a physical change to another one of the physical game pieces.  At least one of the physical objects can be placed in the field of play is an unknown object. 
Furthermore, the processor executes logic for displaying the unknown object as an element of the terrain in the AR game.  If the unknown object does not comport with the game rules, the processor executes instructing logic for instructing the user to
replace the unknown object.  In some embodiments, the processor executes new game piece logic for receiving a signal from an new game piece for identification and inclusion within the field of play, game options providing logic, for providing a plurality
of options related to the AR game for user selection, option receiving logic for receiving the user selection of one of the plurality of options and overlaying logic for overlaying the terrain associated with the user selected option on the field of
play.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a point of view display of the terrain presenting positions of the physical game pieces in the field of play based on a perspective of a selected physical game piece and for displaying the point of view display on a screen
of the computing device is generated by point-of-view display generating logic executed by the processor.  The processor also executes logic for transmitting a signal to affect an attribute of at least one of the physical game pieces at a predetermined
time point in the AR game.
<br/><br/> A non-transitory computer readable storage medium, comprising instructions for implementing an AR game system is disclosed in one embodiment.  The computer readable medium comprises instructions that cause the processor to identify a field of
play for placement of a plurality of physical objects placed within the field of play so as to differentiate between the game pieces and the field of play objects.  The instructions further cause the processor to visibly display on a display screen of a
computing device, the field of play as a terrain for an AR (Augmented Reality) game, wherein each of the field of play objects is displayed with a virtual appearance that differs from an appearance of the field of play object in the real world and
determine if placements of the plurality of physical objects comport with game rules and provide feedback to a user of the computing device if the placements do not comport with the game rules.  If the processor senses that the placement of the plurality
of physical objects comport with the game rules, it signals to the user that the AR game may be commenced.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the computer readable storage medium also comprise instructions that cause the processor to augment an image of at least one of the physical game pieces shown on the display screen with at least one additional virtual
control and receive user input to activate the additional virtual control.  In some embodiments, the computer readable storage medium further comprises instructions, that cause the processor to display a graphic animation upon the activation of the
additional virtual control and transmit a signal for causing a physical change to at least one of the game pieces.  Further instructions are comprised with the storage medium for the processor to display an unknown object in the field of play as an
element of the terrain in the AR game.
<br/><br/> A toy figurine comprising a processor, a processor readable memory, a transceiver for transmitting and receiving signals from an external computing device and a main body comprising a plurality of parts is disclosed in some embodiments.  At
least one of the parts is configured to be responsive to the processor and configured for physical separation from the main body based on a separation instruction from the processor that is initiated by a signal from the computing device.  The at least
one part configured for the physical separation further comprises spring loaded components in an embodiment.  In some embodiments, the plurality of parts further comprise actuating components for physically moving the toy figurine from a first position
to a second position in response to receiving an actuating signal from the processor.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the processor readable memory comprises a code for unique identification of the toy figurine by the external computing device.  In some embodiments, the toy figurine further comprises a sensor for sensing presence of an
object within a predetermined radius, audio components for generating sounds based on audio signals from the processor.  In some embodiments the toy figurine is painted to support 3D object recognition.

more complete understanding of the technology.  The disclosed methods are not limited to the operations and logical flow presented herein.  Alternative embodiments are contemplated in which the order of the various operations is altered and in which
sub-operations described as being part of a larger operation are performed independently.
<br/><br/> For the purposes of this disclosure the term "server" should be understood to refer to a service point which provides processing, database, and communication facilities.  By way of example, and not limitation, the term "server" can refer to a
single, physical processor with associated communications and data storage and database facilities, or it can refer to a networked or clustered complex of processors and associated network and storage devices, as well as operating software and one or
more database systems and applications software which support the services provided by the server.
<br/><br/> For the purposes of this disclosure a "network" should be understood to refer to a network (or collection of devices) that may couple devices so that communications may be exchanged, such as peer-to-peer communications, or those between a server
and a client device or other types of devices, including between wireless devices coupled via a wireless network, for example.  A network may also include mass storage, such as network attached storage (NAS), a storage area network (SAN), or other forms
of computer or machine readable media, for example.  A network may include the Internet, one or more local area networks (LANs), one or more wide area networks (WANs), wire-line type connections, wireless type connections, cellular or any combination
thereof.  Likewise, sub-networks, which may employ differing architectures or may be compliant or compatible with differing protocols, may interoperate within a larger network.  Various types of devices may, for example, be made available to provide an
interoperable capability for differing architectures or protocols.  As one illustrative example, a router may provide a link between otherwise separate and independent LANs.
<br/><br/> For example, a network may enable RF or wireless type communication via one or more network access technologies, such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), General Packet Radio
Services (GPRS), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), LTE Advanced, Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), Bluetooth, 802.11b/g/n, RFID, or the like.  A wireless network may include virtually any type of wireless

or "the," again, may be understood to convey a singular usage or to convey a plural usage, depending at least in part upon context.  In addition, the term "based on" may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an exclusive set of factors and
may, instead, allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described, again, depending at least in part on context.
<br/><br/> Rapid developments in technology have led to the use of computing devices not only for business and scientific purposes but also for the entertainment purposes.  Computerized games with complex rules have gained immense popularity.  As a result,
the video gaming industry has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry where different games have their communities of devoted fans.  As the graphics processing capacity of the microprocessors and data transmission capacities of communication
networks improved, more complex games with realistic images were developed and transmitted to users with nearly zero latency.  This allowed players across the globe to match their skills against each other for greater enjoyment.  However, video games to
date have been confined to the virtual world and have not been very successful in interfacing between the virtual worlds and the real world.
<br/><br/> Embodiments disclosed herein close the gap between the virtual world(s) and the real world in the gaming environment such that events that occur in the virtual world have real world impact and vice-versa.  More particularly, augmented reality
gaming systems and method are discussed wherein augmented images of real-world objects, such as figurines, vehicles or landscape elements are presented to players as game pieces and terrain objects within a field of play on the display screen of a
computing device.  Particular actions executed by the players in the field of play, manually or via the computing device, are interpreted and where appropriate augmented thereby providing a virtual interface for real-world interactions.  In particular
embodiments, the players can affect figurines regardless of whether the figurines are located in proximity or remotely from them.  In fact, some embodiments relate to transforming mundane real-world objects into exciting elements in the virtual world
landscape.  Moreover, various graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are provided which are able to lead the players during the games and thereby mitigating the need for players to learn or refer to complex rules that are the norm in the realm of video games.
<br/><br/> Turning now to the figures, FIG. 1 illustrates an augmented reality game system 100 in accordance with some embodiments.  The gaming system 100 comprises an area 102 designated as the field of play by a computing device 104.  In some
embodiments, a user 106 selects the field of play 102 to set up a plurality of physical objects such as 112, 114, 116 and 118.  The plurality of physical objects can include certain designated game pieces 112, 114 and 116 and some AR game environmental
elements or field of play objects 118, 120 (interchangeably referred to herein as terrain or landscape elements).  In some embodiments the designated game pieces 112, 114 and 116 can be motorized toy figurines or vehicles (interchangeably referred to
herein as game pieces) comprising various active and/or passive components.  The toy figurines 112, 114 and 116 can be components sold as part of a base set of the AR game system 100, or can be obtainable separately.  The game pieces can be configured to
be uniquely recognizable by the computing device 104 via shape or image recognition, or via identifying elements embodied in the game pieces that communicate with the computing device and each other via communication protocols such as but not limited to
Bluetooth, IR (Infra-Red), RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and the like.  In addition, the toy figurines 112, 114 and 116 can be further configured for physical changes in response to signals from the computing device 104 that may be transmitted
via the aforementioned communication protocols.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the elements of an AR game environment or field of play objects 118, 120 can be toy trees or mountains sold with the AR gaming system 100.  In some embodiments, the elements of an AR game environment 118, 120 can be real
world objects which have no particular relevance to the AR game environment such as, a can 118 or a candy packet 120 or similar objects such as overturned cups, scraps of cloth or ribbon, wood blocks, and the like.  In some embodiments, the computing
device 104 can scan such objects, calculate their general size and shape and apply augmented characteristics to the objects in the field of play in a contextually relevant way (and in accordance with game rules), to augment such objects when viewed via
the computing device 104.  In such a way, an overturned cup becomes a hill, the cloth a dirt mound, and the ribbon a stream, as non-limiting examples.
<br/><br/> During play, when viewed on the display 122 of the computing device 104, the appearance of these real world objects 118, 120 is transformed so that they do not appear in their actual form but appear as, for example, trees 124, 128 in the AR
gaming environment.  It may be appreciated that example real world objects 118, 120 and their transformations are only discussed herein for illustration and not limitation.  Any real world object that comports with the game rules can be used and its
appearance on the display 122 is transformed to suit the AR environment, again in accordance with the game rules.  Further details regarding such transformation are discussed infra.
<br/><br/> When the placement of the physical objects 112, 114, 116, 118 and 120 is completed to the user's 106 satisfaction, the user 106 can turn on the computing device 104 and focus the computing device 104 on the field of play 102.  It may be
appreciated that although the computing device 104 is shown to be a tablet device, this is just a suggested embodiment.  Other mobile or stationary computing devices such as but not limited to smartphones, laptops, desktops, tablets, game consoles,
handheld electronic devices or streaming devices may be used to execute the game.  In an embodiment, the camera or other element capable of scanning a physical space (not shown) of the computing device 104 is aimed or focused onto the field of play 102
so that a view of all or parts of the field of play 102 are shown on the display screen 122 of the computing device 104.  A software application or an `app` which comprises a series of instructions executable by a processor (not shown) of the computing
device 104 is activated by the user 106 in order to begin the AR game.  In some embodiments, the app provides the user 106 with a pre-selected, standard "terrain" for the field of play.  In some embodiments, the app can present the user 106 with multiple
options related to different games or different terrains.  For example, options related to game themes based on real world scenes like snowy and mountainous terrain, tropical forests, deserts, marshes, urban environments or even fictitious settings like
an alien planet can be presented for user selection.  Based on the user selection of the game theme, a terrain is overlaid on the view showing the field of play 102 on the display screen 122.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, based on the user selection of the game theme, a set of game rules can be automatically selected for implementation.  For example, a game can have a one player version or a two player version.  Embodiments based on processing power
can comprise without limitation, a single human player game, a single human player playing against the computing device 104, multiple human players in physical proximity to each other such as in the same room sharing the field of play 102, or having
separate fields of play, and multiple players who are geographically remote from each other, each having their own field of play or sharing a field of play through a virtual presentation at one or more players' device.  Based on the user selected
version, a set of game rules may be selected for implementation by the computing device 104.  In some embodiments, further options relating to the games can be presented for user selection.  Such presentation of options can be tied to the user's 106
sophistication levels in accordance with some embodiments.
<br/><br/> Upon generating a view of the field of play 102, the computing device 104 detects the plurality of physical objects located in the field of play 102 so as to differentiate between the game pieces 112,114, 116 and the field of play objects 118,
120.  As described supra, the plurality of physical objects can include real world objects or field of play objects 118, 120 which form part of the AR terrain.  In some embodiments, the appearance of the field of play objects 118 and 120 on the display
screen 122 is altered, changed or augmented by the computing device 104 so that they form elements of the user-selected AR terrain.  In some embodiments, any real world object whose size and shape comports with the game rules can be transformed into an
environmental element as discussed herein.
<br/><br/> For example, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, a forest-like terrain forms the game backdrop and the field of play objects 118 and 120 are augmented to be displayed like trees 124, 128 in the forest based on predetermined game rules.  In some
embodiments, the game can be configured to present options related to the augmentation of the field of play objects 118, 120 for user selection.  For example, based on size and shape of the objects, the user 106 can select from various options such as
but not limited to, large trees, shrubs, a small hill of rocks, mountain etc. In some embodiments the appearance a real world object is not altered or transformed in the display of the computing device if the real world object is too large or too small
to form a part of the AR environment.  In such instances, the user 106 may be instructed to remove or re-position the objects.
<br/><br/> In addition to transforming the appearance of the field of play objects 118, 120, the computing device 104 further identifies game pieces 112, 114 and 116 based on their respective unique identifiers.  It may be appreciated that the game pieces
112, 114 or 116 can be configured as any living/non-living entities which may or may not exist in the real world.  In some embodiments, the processor may cause transmission of a signal from the computing device 104 to the game pieces 112, 114, 116 in
order to obtain their identification indicia.  Based on their identifying indicia, the computing device 104 can determine if the placement of the game pieces 112, 114 and 116 comports with the game rules.  For example, if the user 106 has selected a
single player war game version, then soldier figurines 114 and 116 may belong to two opposing groups based on the game rules.  Therefore, the placement shown in FIG. 1 may be erroneous.  In this case, the user 106 can be advised by the computing device
104 via a message on the display screen 122 or other tactile or audible event, to move one of the soldiers 114 or 116 to the opposite side of the field of play 102.  If, on the other hand, the user 106 selected a two player version to play against
another locally or remotely located player (not shown), the soldiers 114 and 116 may belong to the same group and hence the placement shown in FIG. 1 is in accordance with the game rules.  When the computing device 104 determines that the placement of
the plurality of physical objects 112, 114, 116, 118 and 120 comports with the game rules, it signals the user to start the AR game.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the AR game can involve moving the physical objects 112, 114, 116, 118 and 120 by the user 106.  In such instances, the new positions of any object that is moved can be automatically detected by the computing device 104 and
the scene shown on the display screen 122 can be modified to show the new positions.  In some embodiments, commencing the AR game can change the appearance of one or more game pieces 112, 114 or 116.  For example, the appearance of game pieces such as
the moveable vehicle 112, or soldiers 114, 116 can be augmented on the display screen 122 to show the perimeter of the area within which the vehicle 112 can properly move in accordance with game rules.  In some embodiments, the view of the vehicle 112
can be further augmented with a point selection control (not shown), the selection of which control can cause the vehicle to move to the selected point.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the appearance of the moveable vehicle 112 or the soldiers 114, 116 can be changed or augmented with virtual body parts or weapons in accordance with one or more of the user selected options and game rules in some embodiments.  In
some embodiments, when the virtual weapon of, for example, the moveable vehicle 112 is activated, it can simulate on the display screen 122, a firing of a bullet or a missile or energy ray.  When the missile or the bullet hits another soldier, for
example, soldier 116, then a simulation of the scene is also generated and shown on the display screen 122.  Such a display can be accompanied for example, by sound effects or tactile effects like vibration.  In addition, a signal is sent to the soldier
figurine 116 in order to detach one or more separable parts of the soldier figurine 116 from its main body.  The separation of parts is not only simulated on the display screen 122 but also occurs in the real world.  Therefore, when the user 106 moves
away from the computing device 104, and looks at the soldier figurine 116 in the real world, he or she may find the separable parts detached from the main body of the soldier figurine 116 and lying on the floor.  Thus, virtual effects can be translated
to have real-world impact in accordance with some embodiments.
<br/><br/> It may be appreciated that although the description herein involves a missile shooting from the moveable vehicle 112 to a solider 116 located in its vicinity, this is not necessary.  While the display screen 122 can show a missile emerging from
the moveable vehicle 112, its effect can be felt remotely.  For example, if the user 106 is playing against another user located in the same room or remotely (not shown) in another city/country/continent, the effect of the shooting missile can be
simulated not only on the display screen 122 of the computing device 104 but also on the display screen of the computing device of the other user.  In addition, when the remote user moves away from his/her computing device and views the game piece in the
real world, he or she will find some parts of the soldier figurine which was hit by the missile in the AR game would have fallen to the floor in the real world at the remote location.  Thus, the real-world impact of the AR event is not confined to the
geographic location at which the AR even occurs.  Rather, if the AR event occurs at one location its effect in the real world can manifest at any location regardless of the geographic confines.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a physical mat 132 is used to define the field of play 102.  The user 106 initially lays out the mat 132 thereby defining the field of play 102 and places the real world objects 112,114, 116, 118, 120 within the mat 132.  In
some embodiments, the mat 132 can also include a computing device 134 that facilitates controlling the game pieces 112, 114 and 116.  The computing device 134 can include a processor, a processor readable memory and a transceiver.  The transceiver
facilitates the computing device 134 to exchange signals with the computing device 104.  In some embodiments, the processor readable storage medium of the computing device 134 can store the game rules so that its processor can facilitate better control
of the game pieces as it will be physically connected to the storage medium.  This can enhance the effects of the game, for example, by reducing latency.  In some embodiments, the mat 132 bears a distinctive pattern that enables the computing device 102
to accurately determine the position of the real world objects 112,114, 116, 118, 120 within the field of play 102.  For example, the mat 132 has a grid pattern.  However, other patterns which may include but are not limited to shapes, alphabetical,
numeric, or alphanumeric characters, images or trademarks or other visible or sensible indicia or element can be printed on the game surface mat 132 for position determination.  In other embodiments the mat or game surface can have located in or on, or
embedded therein, sensors that can detect the position, identity and/or capabilities of game elements deployed on the surface.  For example an antenna or sensor array can be positioned in or on a game surface for receiving and sending signals to and from
the game pieces and other game pieces or the computing device(s), or for detecting RFID tags deployed in game pieces, or embedded magnets in the game pieces.  In the case of embedded magnets, in a further embodiment, moveable magnets can be positioned
beneath the game surface that can be controlled by the computing device to capture and move pieces via magnetic attraction.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a stand 136 can be used to hold the computing device 104 not only to prevent its displacement which in turn can disturb the scene on the display screen 122 but also to enhance user convenience during play.  The stand 132 can
be made of metal, plastic or other material and can have clamps or suction elements (not shown) to firmly hold the computing device 104.  In addition, the clamps can be adjustable so that the user 106 can set them at a desired angle for viewing the field
of play 102.
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the AR game system 100 thus balance and seamlessly integrate the virtual and real worlds.  They facilitate easy play as there is no "friction" or burdensome overhead from the technology.  This is because the AR game system 100
involves simple "point and play" wherein the user 106 "looks" at the field of play 102 via a camera or other sensor of the computing device 104 followed by a drag and drop of commands on the display screen 122 or live movement of the game pieces, or
combinations thereof.  In some embodiments, the user interface shown on the display screen 122 can lead the user 106 by providing only relevant choice of commands during game play.  The physical game pieces 112, 114 and 116 that are remotely controllable
follow the commands received from the computing device 104.  The games that can be used with the AR game system 100 further mimic the natural play patterns in a child's imagination via an intermingling of the real and virtual worlds.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 shows a schematic diagram of the various intercommunicating modules of the AR game system 100 executed by the computing device 104.  An input module 210 is configured to receive input from various components of the computing device 104. 
In some embodiments, the user 106 can convey a desire to begin an AR game by activating the input module 210.  The input module 210 receives initial visual or sensed input from the camera or other sensor (not shown) of the computing device 104, alone or
in combination with input from the game surface as discussed above.  For example, the camera associated with the computing device 104 serves as an input device so that the computing device 104 can generate a virtual view of the field of play 102 which is
shown on the display screen 122 by the display module 240.  In embodiments the virtual view can be generated using input from the sensed input of the computing device and information from the game surface as to the location and identity of game pieces
and field of play elements.  In some embodiments, the field of play 102 further comprises the physical objects 112, 114, 116, 118 and 120 which are also shown on the display screen 122.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the input module 210 further transmits the visual or sensed input from the camera and/or game surface to the compliance module 220 which analyzes the distribution of elements in the field of play and determines if the
placement of the physical objects 112, 114, 116, 118 and 120 within the field of play 102 complies with the game rules 232.  The physical object positions can be determined via various methodologies which comprise AR techniques such as 3D recognition by
software such as VUFORIA.TM., use of 2D (two dimensional) markers on the objects, through RFID or via infrared reflection grid or RFID or magnetic detection when the mat 132 is used.  In some embodiments, the compliance module 220 can include programming
logic for delimiting the field of play 102 and for identifying the game pieces 112, 114 and 116 from the field of play objects 118 and 120.  As discussed supra, in embodiments the game pieces 112, 114 and 116 are configured with unique ids which are
received by the communication module 260.  Any object not recognized as a game piece can be designated as a field of play object whose appearance is altered in accordance with the game rules 232.  If the size/shape of the object is not conducive for its
use as a field of play object the user 106 can be advised by the compliance module 220 to remove the object.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the communication module 260 is configured for direct connection with the game pieces 112, 114 and 116 via Bluetooth, WiFi, infrared and the like.  In some embodiments wherein the physical mat 132 with the computing device
134 is used, an indirect communication channel can be established between the game pieces 112, 114, 116 and the computing device 104 via the computing device 134 located on the mat 132.  The game pieces 112, 114, 116 can be connected to the computing
device 134 via wireless channels such as Infrared or RFID channels which in turn can be connected to the computing device 104 through Bluetooth, WiFi or similar channels, or wired.  In order to be configured for multiplayer modes, the computing device
134 can comprise multiple Bluetooth chips or the mat 132 can comprise multiple computing devices that are similar to the device 134.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the game rules 232 stored on the computing device 104 are programmatic routines that provide outputs based on the signals from the input module 210.  As mentioned herein the game rules 232 are dynamically selected based on
the user's 106 choice of the game.  As the game rules 232 are embedded as part of the computing device 104, the user 106 no longer needs the thick rule books that used to govern the minutiae of game play.  At each step, the game rules 232 operate to
offer the user 106 only choices that are relevant for that step so that the user 106 is saved the effort or trouble of calculating all the different variables in a game simulation.  In some embodiments, the game rules 232 can be selected based not only
on the particular game selected by the user 106 but also on the various game options such as, single/multiplayer, proximate/remote opponent, level of difficulty and the like.  For example, if the user 106 has chosen a multi-player game with a proximate
opponent, the computing device 104 can select game rules 232 whereby the field of play 102 not only accommodates game pieces 112, 114 and 116 belonging to the user 106 but also accommodates the game pieces belonging to the opponent.  On the other hand,
if the user 106 has chosen a multiplayer game with remotely located opponent(s), the game rules 232 are selected that allow the user's 106 pieces to occupy the entire field of play 102, with the remote user's pieces appearing virtually on the display,
and vice-versa for the remote user.  Another possibility involves the user 106 selecting a single player version in which case the game pieces 112, 116 and 116 need to be distributed between two opposing groups.  In this case, the game rules 232 can
require the user 106 to identify the members of the opposing groups among the game pieces 112, 114 and 116.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the display module 240 is configured to change the appearance of the real world objects 112, 114, 116, 118 and 120 when showing them within the AR environment on the display screen 122.  Images of the field of play elements
118 and 120 can be varied by the display module 240 so that they appear as elements in the AR terrain in the virtual world based on the shape/size of the objects 118, 120 and game rules 232.  By way of non-limiting example, if the user 106 has selected a
forest as the game locale, the elements 118, 120 are transformed as trees by the display module 240 when shown on the display screen 122 in FIG. 1.  Images of game pieces 112, 114 or 116 on the display screen 122 can be augmented by appearance and with
additional virtual weapons or body parts.  Activation of such virtual weapons by the user 106 can result in occurrence of AR events which can have real world impact.  For example, a missile shot from a virtual weapon of the game piece 112 can cause a
portion of another game piece 114 to be physically separated from its main body as will be detailed further herein.
<br/><br/> Based on the selected game rules 232, the compliance module 220 determines if the placements of the real world objects 112, 114, 116, 118 and 120 within the field of play 102 complies with game rules 232.  If the placements comply with the game
rules 232 then the compliance module 220 can signal the user 106 to start the game, for example, via a pop up message on the display screen 122.  As described supra, the appearance of one or more of the game pieces 112, 114, 116 and the field of play
objects 118, 120 can be altered upon the commencement of the game.  The field of play objects 118, 120 are altered to appear as AR terrain elements.  The game pieces 112, 114 and 116 can be augmented with virtual controls which when activated by the user
106 enable execution of various actions in the virtual world.  Such actions can have impact in the real world as detailed herein.
<br/><br/> When the user 106 executes any action during game play, the input module 210 detects such user input and the compliance module 220 determines if such action comports with the game rules 232.  For example, if the user 106 physically moves the
game piece 116, the compliance module 220 determines if the new position of the game piece 116 is in compliance with the game rules 232.  In case it does not comply with the game rules 232, feedback can be provided to the user 106 in accordance with the
game rules 232.  The feedback can include signaling the user 106 to move the game piece 116 or decrementing the user's score 106 and the like.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, if an action executed by the user's 106 opponent during game play complies with the game rules 232, the computing device 104 can receive a signal via the communication module 260 to execute certain actions.  For example, if the
opponent shoots a missile at the game piece 114, the communication module 260 can receive a signal which is communicated to the execution module 250.  The execution module 250 can cause the computing device 104 to execute actions such as but not limited
to simulating an explosion on the display screen 122 in proximity to the game piece 114, producing sound, tactile or other effects.  Moreover, the communication module 260 can also transmit a separation instruction to the game piece 114.  Upon receiving
the separation instruction, the parts of the game piece 114 configured for physical separation are detached and fall away from its main body.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the various modules detailed herein employ 3-dimensional object recognition technology such as VUFORIA.TM.  can be employed for such image augmentation.  VUFORIA.TM.  is a software platform from QUALCOMM.TM.  that uses computer
vision-based image recognition that enables AR app experiences.  SMART TERRAIN.TM.  is a feature of the VUFORIA.TM.  SDK (software development kit) that enables development of immersive augmented reality gaming experiences via augmenting the physical
environment to create new kinds of gaming and visualization applications such as the as the AR game system 100 described herein.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a schematic illustration of a toy figurine 300 that can be used as a game piece in accordance with some embodiments.  It may be appreciated that the shape/size of the toy figurine 300 is only shown for illustration purposes and that a
toy figurine of any shape and size can be configured with elements as described herein.  In other words it may be an entity, a vehicle, an aircraft or spaceship, an animal, an alien or any other game element that might be imagined.  The toy figurine 300
comprises a main body 340 which includes a processor 310, a processor readable storage medium 320 and a transceiver 330 that enable control and communication of the toy figurine 300 with an external computing device 104.  Again, the placement of the
processor 310, the processor readable storage medium 320 and the transceiver 330 as shown in FIG. 3 is only by the way of illustration and that these elements can be placed anywhere within the toy figurine 300.
<br/><br/> The main body 340 has a plurality of parts 342, 344 and 346 attached thereto.  At least a subset of the parts 342, 344, 346 can be configured with controllable spring-loaded components or other controllable releasable securement devices such as
magnets or clips or clamps for example, so as to cause remotely controllable separation from the main body 340 in response to receiving a separation instruction from the processor 310.  At the end of the game (or when game rules permit), the user 106 can
re-attach the parts to the main body 340 for future play.  In some embodiments, the transceiver 330 can receive a signal from the computing device 104 regarding an AR event occurring in the virtual world.  In response to receiving the signal from the
computing device 104, the processor 310 can be configured to control the toy figurine 300 to be responsive to the AR event (for example an AR laser blast).  In some embodiments, one or more of the parts 342, 344 and 346 can also be configured for
actuation in response to an actuating instruction from the processor 310.  This can enable the toy figurine 300 to move from one position to another in the real world.  In some embodiments, the part 346 can be configured with a motorized base or surface
to which different versions of the main bodies can be detachably coupled thereby facilitating creating different game pieces interchangeable among a single motorized base 346 and a plurality of different main bodies.
<br/><br/> Embodiments can include the toy figurine 300 configured not only for physical movement or separation but also for moving parts 352, 354, 356 of a face 350 or other moveable parts 342, 344, 346.  In some embodiments, emotions can be expressed via
real or virtual augmentation of the figurine's 300 appearance on the display screen 122.  In embodiments the game piece(s) can have their behavior altered as a result of game events or opponent moves (e.g. inflicted wounds, hunger, thirst, anger,
exhaustion) or via user selection of a behavior or the passage of time in the game.  In some embodiments, the toy figurine 300 can communicate via producing light from LEDs on its body 340 or face 350 or by producing a sound via one or more of activation
of sound elements present within the figurine's 300 body 340 or via the speakers of the computing device 104 or another sound system (not shown) via a wired or wireless connection.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, certain portions of the game rules 322 can be stored in the processor readable storage medium 320.  For example, if a muddy/marshy or snowy war game locale is selected by the user 106, the computing device 104 can initially
store certain game rules 322 that affect the speed of the toy figurine 300 in the storage medium 320 initially and over time.  Therefore, as the game progresses, the processor 310 can cause the toy figurine 300 to move more slowly as it slogs through
increasing amounts of virtual mud as the game progresses and the virtual battlefield is "chewed up" by virtual game piece traversal.  Similarly, game rules 322 can also include instructions to produce certain pre-recorded sounds via speakers which may be
included in the toy figurine 300, or the sounds can be transmitted to remote speakers such as an audio surround system for a heightened sensory experience.  In some embodiments, the toy figurine 300 can be painted with special visible or invisible (UV)
paints or be fabricated from or incorporate materials that can sensed and used to enhance the appearance of the toy figurine 300 in the virtual world when viewed through the computing device 104.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is an illustration that depicts how a real world scene 400 is transformed in the virtual world 450 when viewed on the display screen 122 of the computing device 104 in accordance with some embodiments of the AR game system 100.  A few
randomly selected real-world objects can be transformed into elements of the AR terrain in the virtual world by modules of the AR game system 100 executing on the computing device 104.  Regularly shaped objects such as boxes 402, 404, a can of soda 406
or irregularly shaped objects such as the books 408 heaped haphazardly together or a pile of cloth 410 can be transformed into respective AR terrain elements 412, 414, 416, 418 and 420 based on one or more of the game rules and user choices.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the user's 106 choice of a game locale can cause the regularly shaped objects 402, 404, 406 to be transformed into buildings/ruins 416, 418, 420 and irregularly shaped objects to be transformed as hills or heaps of snow/sand
or other organic terrain 412, 414.  In some embodiments, the display module 240 can automatically determine/select the AR terrain elements into which the objects 402, 404, 406, 408 and 410 are to be transformed based, for example, on the game rules 232. 
In some embodiments, the user 106 can select from various options to transform the real world objects 402, 404, 406, 408 and 410 into AR terrain elements.  The options that are possible for a given game locale or AR terrain can be provided to the user
106 by the game rules 232 based on the size and shape of the real world objects 402, 404, 406, 408 and 410.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is an illustration 500 that shows various game pieces augmented with virtual controls in accordance with some embodiments.  An illustration of a game piece such as, the toy figurine of a soldier 116 augmented with a virtual control 502 is
shown at 510.  In this case, the game piece 116 is placed on the mat 132 and viewed through the display screen 122 of the computing device 104.  The appearance of the game piece 116 is altered to include the virtual control 504 that shows targeting
information or the moveable range in which the game piece 116 can be moved in accordance with the game rules 132.  This can involve the computing device 104 to identify the game piece 116 and calculation of its allowed range per the game rules 232.  For
example, as the game progresses and the game piece 116 moves in snow/mud, the AR view shows the mud/snow sticking to game piece 112 and its moveable range can be reduced accordingly by the game rules 232.  In some embodiments, the moveable range can be
limited due to the presence of a field of play object or a virtual obstacle.  At 520, the user 106 physically moves the game piece 116 in compliance with the game rules.  If the game piece 116 lies outside the allowable range shown by 504 a message can
be displayed to the user 106 on the display screen 122 to place the game piece 116 within the range set by the same rules 232.
<br/><br/> Another illustration of a game piece such as the toy figurine 112 augmented by a virtual control 506 when viewed on the display screen 122 is shown at 530.  The virtual control 506 is similar to the virtual control 504 in that it represents the
moveable range within which the game piece 112 can be moved in accordance with the game rules 132.  However, in this case, the virtual control 506 is operable to physically displace the game piece 112 in the real world.  Such displacement is made
possible via allowing the user 106 to select on the display screen 122 a point 508 indicative of the position to which the user 106 desires to move the game piece 112 within the moveable range 506.  In response to the user selection of the point 508, the
computing device 104 can activate the game piece 112 to move to the new position indicated by the point 508 in accordance with embodiments detailed further infra.  The automatic displacement of the game piece 112 from its original position shown at 510
to its new position 508 is shown at 540.  It can be appreciated that although a soldier figurine 116 is shown as being displaced by a user while a vehicle figurine 112 is shown as being automatically displace, this is not necessary.  Any toy figurine
having a motorized base 346 or other capability for controllable motion (e.g. a quad rotor or magnetic base as described above) can be displaced and relocated automatically in accordance with embodiments detailed herein as game rules permit.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 shows an embodiment of the AR game system 100 that illustrates auto-selection of game pieces and adding special abilities/actions.  In some embodiments of the AR game, when a game piece 604 is damaged, it can be healed by another game
piece 602 that is auto-selected by the computing device 104 as shown at 610.  The game piece 604 can be damaged due to an opponent's action, game rules 232 or combinations thereof.  In some embodiments, the damage can be virtual wherein the game piece
604 remains inoperable even when there is no physical change.  In some embodiments, the damage can be real wherein separable portions of the game piece 604 have fallen away due to a separation instruction received from the gaming device 104.  When the
game piece 602 is selected for healing, it can cause an image animation to execute on the display screen 122 as shown at 620 and the damaged piece 604 is re-activated by the game rules 232.  In addition, if the damage is physical, the user 106 can also
be instructed to affix the detached portions back to the main body of the game piece 604.
<br/><br/> It may be appreciated that the special ability such as healing is described herein only by way of illustration and not limitation and that other special abilities like assisting with physical help or advice, communication and the like associated
with any of the physical game pieces 112, 114, 116 or other virtual elements of a game can be provided.  In some embodiments, the special abilities can be simulated in the AR world.  In some embodiments, certain parts of the game pieces 112, 114, 116 can
be physically actuated as a special ability.  In some elements, the special abilities can be provided by the game or as a reward (or penalty) for an achievement or action in the game.  In some embodiments, the special abilities can be selected by the
user 106 from finite options presented on the display screen 122 in accordance with the game rules 232.  The options for adding special abilities to the physical/virtual game pieces can be provided to the user 106 as in-game purchase, as a reward for
achieving certain performance levels, or even as a limited preview for future purchase.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is an illustration 700 that depicts the occurrence of an AR event in accordance with some embodiments.  The computing device 104 is focused on a real toy figurine 702 which is augmented or overlaid with virtual controls indicative of its
line of sight 708 and range 712 of its virtual weapons 706.  In some embodiments, the opponent 704 can be a real toy figurine located geographically proximate, for example, on the same mat (not shown) as the toy figurine 702.  In some embodiments, the
opponent 704 can be a virtual image of another toy figurine that is at a geographically remote location from the toy figurine 702.  When the virtual weapons 706 are fired by the toy figurine 702, it can have one or more of a virtual or real impact on the
toy figurine 704 regardless of its geographic location in accordance with the game rules 232.  The firing can be accompanied with special effects that include sudden lighting explosions, sound, smoke trails in the virtual world and the like.  Similarly,
when a missile is approaching the opponent, Doppler sound and visual effects, smoke trails and the like can be produced on the computing device of the opponent.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 is an illustration 800 that show the AR explosion and the physical impact of the virtual weapons 706 in accordance with embodiments described herein.  When the virtual weapons 706 are fired, their range and point of impact can be
calculated, for example, by the execution module 250 of the computing device 104 based on the game rules 232.  For example, the game rules 232 can require that the position and angle of the toy 702 firing the weapons be input into the calculation of the
range and impact point.  In addition, other factors such as the kind of virtual weapons 706 being fired can be considered in determining the level of impact.  For less powerful weapons, the impact can occur only in the virtual world whereas a real world
impact can be observed for more powerful weapons such as those shown in FIG. 7.  Thus, based on the calculations of range, point of impact and power of the weapons, the computing device 104 can transmit a signal directly or to another computing device in
or proximate the toy (not shown) controlling the toy figurine 704 to send a separation instruction.  For example, the signal from the computing device 104 can be transmitted to the other computing device via Bluetooth or WiFi.  In some embodiments such
as those wherein both the toy figurines 702, 704 are located in geographic proximity, the computing device 104 will be controlling both the figurines 702 and 704.  Hence the separation instruction to the toy figurine 704 will be transmitted by the
computing device 104 only.  Although the description herein refers to weapons 706 as purely virtual, it can be appreciated that the weapons 706 can be toy missiles fired by the toy figurine 702 via actuation of some physical/AR controls by the user 106.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is an illustration 900 that shows an embodiment wherein direct user action is required for occurrence of an AR event.  The user 106 in this instance is attempting to defeat an opponent via a sniper shot.  The computing device 910 is
directed towards the opponent's physical game piece 902 by the user.  In some embodiments, a view 912 of the field of play from the point of view (POV) of the game piece 908 is generated.  The user can then execute an action, for example, a drag/drop of
a virtual control 904 in order to fire an AR event.  As described supra, the AR event can result in virtual and/or real impacts.  Thus, embodiments of the AR game system 100 help maintain a balance between the physical and digital play.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, when the user 106 selects to generate a view of the game environment in the POV of the physical game piece 902, the game continues in the POV of the game piece 902 until the user 106 elects to exit the POV mode or selects
another game piece for generating the POV.  In the latter case, another POV view of the game environment based on the selected other game piece can be generated.  It may be appreciated that in some embodiments, selection of game pieces for generating the
POV views can be restricted based on the game rules.  By the way of illustration and not limitation, POVs can only be generated for the user 106 for his/her own game pieces and not opponents game pieces in some embodiments.  In some embodiments, multiple
players involved in a game can be playing in their respective POV modes.  Thus, any events that occur in the game can be viewed on their respective devices based on the POV of their selected game piece.  Furthermore, the result of events that occur in
the POV mode can still be viewable when the user 106 switches back to the third person mode.  For example, if a tree which collapsed in response to some game event may not have been viewable to the user 106 in the POV 912 mode.  However, it can be
viewable when the user 106 switches to the third person mode.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, two views of the gaming environment can be generated and shown for example, via a split screen mode.  The views can be one or more of POV views associated with the game pieces, third person views or combinations thereof.  In
some embodiments, the display module 240 can be further configured with programming logic to automatically switch the POV based, for example, on the distance of the computing device 104 from particular game pieces.  In such embodiments, such options can
be selected by the user 106 during the game set up.  When the user 106 selects such options, the distance of the computing device 104 from the game pieces is monitored and when the computing device 104 is within a threshold distance of the physical game
piece 902, a view of the gaming environment in the point of view of the game piece 902 can be automatically generated.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 is a display 1000 that shows digital enhancements to the two real toy figurines 702, 704.  In some embodiments, with the progress of game play, the user 106 can be provided with an opportunity for in-game upgrades.  Thus, when the user's
106 game piece faces a particularly formidable enemy, the game rules 232 provide the user 106 to access a virtual upgrade for the toy figurine for a price via an e-commerce site or in-app purchase or other payment mechanism, or earned for achieving a
certain move or proficiency level in the game, in exchange for viewing an advertisement, or accepting branding on game pieces, or other monetization options.  In an embodiment, the virtual upgrade can be additional tools or powers.  In an embodiment, the
virtual upgrade can comprise additional weapons.  In FIG. 10, the toy figurine 702 is augmented with an additional weapon "rail gun" 1002.  Similarly, the toy figurine 704 has also received an additional weapon "shoulder launcher" in a virtual upgrade. 
In some embodiments, the additional tools received in virtual upgrades can be available for limited time/turns after which they will no longer be available to the user 106.  The user 106 may need to pay additional fee in order to continue access to the
virtual tools.  As the game ecosystem evolves new tools/upgrades may become available to the user 106 for purchase.  Again, it may be appreciated that although virtual upgrades are illustrated as new tools/weapons herein, this is not necessary.  New AR
environmental elements, virtual characters, terrains, field of play objects and the like can all be available for virtual upgrades.  Again, as discussed supra, although 702, 704 are depicted as being in the same location and controlled by the computing
device 104, this is not necessary.  The toy figurines 702, 704 can be in geographically remote locations and communicating through two different computing devices via the Internet to generate virtual events that have virtual/real world impact at either
of the locations.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 is a flowchart 1100 that details a methodology of the game set up as executed by the computing device 114 in accordance with some embodiments described herein.  The method begins at 1102 wherein an input that convey's the user's 116
desire to begin an AR game is received.  At 1104, various user selections related to the game, the AR terrain for the game, game modes and the like are received.  The game rules 232 are selected at 1106 based at least on the user selections received at
1104.  The field of play 112 is identified at 1108 and the real world objects 112, 114, 116, 118, 120 within the field of play 102 are detected at 1110.  The game pieces 112, 114 and 116 are identified at 1112.  For example, all the game pieces 112, 114,
116 can be identified as associated with a single group or army or based on user selections at 1104, different pieces may need to belong to different groups.  Thus, the identification of game pieces at 1112 can affect their appearance in the AR game
display.
<br/><br/> Based on the received user selections and game rules a display of the field of play with the augmented game pieces is generated at 1114.  At 1116 it is determined if the game pieces 112, 114, 116 are positioned within the field of play 102 in
accordance with the game rules 232.  As described supra, the positions can be determined via 3D object recognition techniques, 2 dimensional markers on the game pieces, RFID, position calculations from view obtained using the camera, IR designs on the
mat 132 and similar techniques.  In some embodiments, based on the extent of the field of play, the relative positions of the various game pieces may be coded into the AR game and the current positions of the game pieces 112, 114, 116 can be compared
with such pre-coded positions in order to make the determination at 1116.  If yes, the user 106 is signaled at 1118 that the game can be commenced and the method terminates on the end block.  Else, the game piece that needs to be re-positioned in order
to comply with the game rules is identified at 1120, an instruction regarding the direction and the extent to which the game piece(s) needs to be moved is provided at 1122 and the method returns to 1116 to determine if the game piece has been position
accurately.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 is a flowchart 1200 the details a methodology of generating an impact of an event in accordance with some embodiments.  The method commences at 1202 wherein the occurrence of an event is detected.  Various AR and real-world events can
occur in a game which can include but are not limited to events that occur due to user actions or events that can be fired by the AR game rules.  Events that occur due to user actions can comprise the user 106 activating an AR control to change the
position of a game piece or activate a weapon.  Events that are automatically fired by the game rules 232 can include but are not limited to an automatic instruction from the computing device 104 to one or more of the game pieces 112, 114, 116 to slow
down movement or stop while moving due to for example, AR obstacles in their path.  Moreover, some events can have both virtual impact and impact in the real world.  It is therefore determined at 1204 if the event that occurred at 1202 has a physical
impact.  If it has no physical impact, its virtual effects are simulated by the computing device 104 at 1210 and the method terminates on the end block.  If it has a physical impact, the parameters of the physical impact are calculated at 1206.  For
example, if the event is activation of a virtual control for movement of a game piece by the user 106, the direction, speed and distance associated with motion of the game piece is calculated at 1206.  Similarly, if a virtual missile is fired, the speed
at which it flies, distance of its flight and the point of impact is calculated at 1206.  If an automatic AR event to slow down a game piece is fired at 1202, then the extent to which a game piece needs to slow down is calculated at 1206.  Thus, the
parameters calculated at 1206 are based on the type of effects the events have.
<br/><br/> Upon calculation of the parameters, the physical change is effected at 1208.  Effecting a physical change can comprise moving a vehicular game piece 112 by a predetermined distance or sending instructions to a game piece which instructions can
include but are not limited to separation instruction, instruction to slow down, instruction to generate sound/light effects and the like.  It can be appreciated that all the steps of the process 1200 need not be executed by a single computing device. 
For example, if the missile is fired by the computing device 104 of the user 106 at a game piece controlled by another computing device, then such event is transmitted by the computing device 104 to the other computing device via networks such as
Bluetooth, WiFi or the Internet.  In this case, the steps of determining/calculating the physical impact parameters and effecting the physical change can be carried out by the other computing device in accordance with some embodiments.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 is a flowchart 1300 that details the game play in accordance with some embodiments.  The method begins at 1302 wherein the user's 106 selection of one of the user's own game pieces for playing a turn is received.  At 1304, the various
actions that can be effectuated by the user 106 via the game piece 112 are displayed to the user 104 on the display screen 122.  The actions associated with the selected game piece 112 can vary based on the game rules 232 and current game conditions. 
The actions displayed at 1304 can affect the same game piece or they can affect multiple game pieces.  By the way of illustration and not limitation, action such as moving the selected game piece 112 from one position to another generally does not affect
other game pieces.  However, other actions such as attacking an opponent's game pieces are possible in war games in which case other game pieces are affected.  Moreover, for the same game piece 112, the actions presented to the user 106 at 1304 can
depend on various factors such as but not limited to, the game being played, the level of progress in the game, the sophistication of the player 106, the in-game options that the user 106 has earned or purchased and the role of the game piece 112 in the
game.  At 1306, the user selection of one of the actions is received.
<br/><br/> At 1308 it is determined if the user selected action necessitates selection of another game element.  For example, the user 106 can select to interact with another game element.  The interaction can comprise without limitation, attacking an
opponent's game piece or destroying an obstacle comprising a field of play objects 118, 120 or special actions such as healing or communication.  If is it determined at 1308 that the user selected to interact with another game element, the user's
selection of the other game element is received at 1310 and the attribute changes resulting from the user selected action are calculated at 1312.  If it is determined at 1308 that the action selected at 1306 does not involve another game element, the
method proceeds directly to 1312 wherein the attribute changes resulting from the user selected action are calculated.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, if the user has selected to move the game piece 112 has to a new destination, the position of the game piece 112 in the field of play 102, the various views of the field of play 102, any other attributes such as appearance
of the game piece 112 that may have changed due to the move need to be determined at 1312.  At 1314 the user's selected action is executed.  Thus, at 1314 changes such as but not limited to the game piece 112 being moved to a new position, firing a
virtual control associated with the game piece 112 to affect another game element or changes resulting from activation of a special ability are effectuated.
<br/><br/> The field of play conditions and the attributes that changed due to the action at 1314 are updated at 1316.  The updates at 1316 may or may not be visible to the user 106.  Such updates can include but are not limited to, any changes to the
appearance of the game piece(s) and/or field of play 102, a refreshed view of the field of play 102 or a recordation of the attribute of an affected game piece which may not be immediately visible to the user or selection of further game rules in
response to the executed action.  At 1318, it is determined if the game has ended.  If yes, the process terminates on the end block, else it returns to 1302 to await the next selection from the user 106.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the user 106 can select an action that affects the same game piece selected for playing the turn and wherein the action does not affect other game pieces.  By the way of illustration and not limitation, moving the selected
game piece 112 from one position to another within the field of play 102 is an action that does not affect other game pieces.  FIG. 14 is a flowchart 1400 that details execution of the user selected action for a game piece which does not affect other
game pieces in accordance with some embodiments.  The method begins at 1402 wherein the valid moves or permitted paths or destinations are calculated based on the game rules and the current game conditions.
<br/><br/> For example, there may be multiple moves permitted for the selected game piece 112 based on the nature of the game or the movement of the game piece 112 may be restricted due to a game condition, such as presence of a physical or virtual
obstacle.  The valid moves affecting the selected game piece 112 thus derived and available for further user selection are shown on the display screen 122 at 1404.  The user selection of one of the moves for the game piece 112 is received at 1406.  At
1408, it is determined if the game piece 112 is motorized.  As described supra, the physical game pieces can be motorized to facilitate independent motion based on the signals from the computing device 104 or they may not be motorized in which case they
need to be moved by the user 106 by hand.  If it is determined at 1408 that the game piece 112 is motorized, a signal is transmitted by the computing device 104 at 1410 to move the game piece to the user-selected destination and the process terminates. 
If it is determined at 1408 that the game piece is not motorized, the user 106 is instructed to move the game piece 112 to the selected destination at 1412.  In some embodiments, the destination can be indicated to the user 106 via visible insignia on
the display screen 122.  At 1414, it is determined of the piece was moved to the selected/valid destination.  If it is determined at 1414 that the game piece 112 was moved to an invalid destination, the process returns to 1412 wherein the user 106 is
instructed to move the game piece 112 to the indicated destination.  If at 1414, it is determined if the game piece 112 was moved to the selected/valid destination the process terminates on the end block.
<br/><br/> FIG. 15 is a flowchart 1500 details execution of the user selected action for a game piece that affects other game pieces in accordance with some embodiments.  The method begins at 1502 wherein available interactions between the game piece 112
and the selected game element are displayed.  At 1504, the interaction selected by the user 106 is received.  At 1506, the attributes associated with the user selected interaction are calculated.  The attributes can be calculated based on but not limited
to the game rules, nature of the game elements selected for interaction, position of the game elements, any tools (such as weapons) of the interaction.  At 1508, it is determined if the user 106 is in the POV mode.  If yes, the interaction between the
selected game piece 112 and the other game elements is carried out in the POV mode as shown at 1512.  The user 106 therefore views the interaction in the POV mode.  Similarly, if another user is viewing the interaction from his/her respective computing
device then the interaction may or may not be seen by the other user based on their view of the field of play 102.  Thus, if the other user is viewing the field of play 102 in a POV mode associated with a game piece, the interaction is viewable based on
the view of the game piece associated with the POV.  If at 1508, it is determined that the user 106 is viewing the field of play 102 in a third-person mode or AR mode, a full view of the field of play 102 along with the interaction is shown to the user
106 on the display screen at 1510.  In addition, any physical changes resulting from the interaction are effectuated at 1510.  If another user is viewing the interaction in an AR view, the interaction can be viewed by the other user.  In some
embodiments, if the user 106 or the other user switches from the POV mode to the AR or third-person mode after the interaction, then the physical changes at 1510 will be viewed by them at 1514.
<br/><br/> As shown in the example of FIG. 16, internal architecture of a computing device 1600 includes one or more processing units (also referred to herein as CPUs) 1612, which interface with at least one computer bus 1602.  Also interfacing with
computer bus 1602 are persistent storage medium/media 1606, network interface 1614, memory 1604, e.g., random access memory (RAM), run-time transient memory, read only memory (ROM), etc., media disk drive interface 1608, an interface 1620 for a drive

comprise program code or logic, and/or computer-executable process steps, incorporating functionality described herein, e.g., one or more of process flows described herein.  CPU 1612 first loads computer-executable process steps or logic from storage,
e.g., memory 1604, storage medium/media 1606, removable media drive, and/or other storage device.  CPU 1612 can then execute the stored process steps in order to execute the loaded computer-executable process steps.  Stored data, e.g., data stored by a
storage device, can be accessed by CPU 1612 during the execution of computer-executable process steps.
<br/><br/> Persistent storage medium/media 1606 is a computer readable storage medium(s) that can be used to store software and data, e.g., an operating system and one or more application programs.  Persistent storage medium/media 1606 can also be used to
store device drivers, such as one or more of a digital camera driver, monitor driver, printer driver, scanner driver, or other device drivers, web pages, content files, metadata, playlists and other files.  Persistent storage medium/media 1606 can
further include program modules/program logic in accordance with embodiments described herein and data files used to implement one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.
