       <p> Various aspects of the invention described herein provide systems and
     methods for context-linked importation of user information. One aspect of
     the invention provides a method for context-linked importation of user
     information. The method includes: providing an interactive environment
     that allows posting of content by a plurality of pre-identified users;
     receiving content for the interactive environment from a pre-identified
     user; selecting relevant data about the pre-identified user from a
     database, the relevant data selected based on information contained in
     the content; and displaying the relevant data along with the content on
     the interactive environment.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Various aspects of the invention described herein provide systems and methods for context-linked importation of user information.  Aspects of the invention are particularly applicable to interactive environments such as message boards (also
known as Internet forums, online discussion sites, bulletin boards, and the like).  Aspects of the invention are also applicable to other varieties of Internet applications.
<br/><br/> In general, aspects of the invention integrate aspects of a user's background and/or history and associate relevant data from the user's background and/history with a posting by the user.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1, an exemplary network topology 100 for an interactive environment (e.g., a message board) is depicted.  The message board is hosted on server 102, which is in communication with clients 104a-c via network 106.
<br/><br/> The terms "client" and "server" are used to reflect a client-server relationship between elements 102 and 104a-104c.  Suitable devices for server element 102 include, but are not limited to general-purpose computers, including, but not limited
to computers with higher processing power colloquially known as "servers." Likewise, suitable devices for client elements 104a-104c include, but are not limited to general-purpose computers, including, but not limited to desktop computers, laptop
computers, tablet computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, video game systems, digital video recorders (DVRs), and the like.
<br/><br/> Clients 104 can interact with one or more peripheral devices (not depicted).  Such peripherals can include conventional peripherals such as cameras, microphones, and the like as well as medical device such as insulin pumps, pacemakers, and the
like.  Client 104 can interact with peripherals using a variety of wired or wireless standards.
<br/><br/> Suitable wired standards include Universal Serial Bus (USB), USB 2.0, IEEE 1394, Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and the like.  The USB and USB 2.0 standards are described in publications such as Andrew S.
Tanenbaum, Structured Computer Organization .sctn.3.6.4 (5th ed.  2006); and Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Modern Operating Systems 32 (2d ed.  2001).  The IEEE 1394 standard is described in Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Modern Operating Systems 32 (2d ed.  2001).  The
PCI standard is described in Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Modern Operating Systems 31 (2d ed.  2001); Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Structured Computer Organization 91, 183-89 (4th ed.  1999).  The Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet standards are discussed in Andrew S.
Tanenbaum, Computer Networks 17, 65-68, 271-92 (4th ed.  2003).
<br/><br/> Suitable wireless standards include Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15.4, and the like.  The Bluetooth standard is discussed in Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Computer Networks 21, 310-17 (4th ed.  2003).  The IEEE 802.11 standard is discussed in Andrew
S. Tanenbaum, Computer Networks 292-302 (4th ed.  2003).  The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is described in Yu-Kai Huang &amp; Ai-Chan Pang, "A Comprehensive Study of Low-Power Operation in IEEE 802.15.4," in MSWiM'07 405-08 (2007).
<br/><br/> Network 106 can be any network capable of transmitting data between clients 104a-104c and server 102, for example, an intranet or the Internet.
<br/><br/> The server can be in communication with a database 108.  Database 108 can be operated through a database management system (DBMS).  A DBMS is imposed upon data to form a logical and structured organization of the data.  A DBMS lies between the
physical storage of data and the users and handles the interaction between the two.  Examples of DBMSes include DB2.RTM.  and INFORMIX.RTM.  both available from IBM Corp.  of Armonk, N.Y.; MICROSOFT JET.RTM.  and MICROSOFT SQL SERVER.RTM.  both available
from the Microsoft Corp.  of Redmond, Wash.; MYSQL.RTM.  available from the MySQL Ltd.  Co.  of Stockholm, Sweden; ORACLE.RTM.  Database, available from Oracle Int'l Corp of Redwood City, Calif.; and SYBASE.RTM.  available from Sybase, Inc.  of Dublin,
Calif.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 2A, the operation of an interactive environment (e.g., a message board) is depicted.  A user interface 200a is provided to one or more users.  The user interface 200a can be provided via an Internet browser such as INTERNET
EXPLORER.RTM., available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.; FIREFOX.RTM., available from the Mozilla Foundation of Mountain View, Calif.; OPERA.RTM., available from Opera Software AS of Oslo, Norway; or CHROME.TM., available from Google Inc. 
of Menlo Park, Calif.  Alternatively, the user interface 200a can be provided via specially-programmed software, such as an application installed on clients 104a-104c.
<br/><br/> The user interface 200a includes one or more postings 202a-202c.  These postings 202a-202c were previously transmitted to the server by users.  Each posting 202a-202c can include information about the author of the posting 202a-202c.  For
example, the postings 202a-202c can display user name 204a-204c and/or a picture, icon, or avatar 206a-206c associated with the author of the posting 202a 202c.  Each posting 202a-202c can also display other information about the author such as age,
gender, disease, remedies, and the like.  Such information can be represented graphically in a mosaic 208a-208c as depicted in FIG. 2a.  The posting can also display information 210a-210c about the author's posting history such as the number of posts and
number of postings by the author that were designated "helpful" by other users.
<br/><br/> Postings 202a-202c can also contain user-posted content 212a-212c.  For example, in posting 202a in FIG. 2, user "BernieB" inquires about other users' experience with PROZAC.RTM.  (fluoxetine hydrochloride).  User-posted content 212a-212c can
include any combination of media including text, audio, video, graphics, emoticons, and the like.  The postings 202a-202c can include a time-stamp 214a-214c indicating when the posting was submitted.
<br/><br/> One or more users can respond to posting 202a by a user by entering content in field 215 and pressing the "Post Reply" button 217.  This reply is added to the message board one or more users to view.  For example, as depicted in postings 202b
and 202b in FIG. 2, users "MASarah" and "Enrique" provide commentary on their experiences and the experiences of others with PROZAC.RTM..
<br/><br/> The invention herein allows for the context-linked importation of user information into a message board.  The message board is associated with one or more databases containing information about a plurality of users.
<br/><br/> The stored information can include one or more medical condition metric.  A medical condition metric can be a qualitative or quantitative metric related to a medical condition.  For example, a medical condition metric can be a qualitative
measure of an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patient's feeling of well-being at a particular time of day.  The patient may feel great, good, fair, poor, or awful at a particular time of day due to the symptoms and treatments for ALS, and daily
activities such as eating and exercising that interact with and affect his condition.  Alternatively, the metric can be quantitative in nature, such as blood pressure (e.g., for a patient with heart disease), blood test values (e.g., sodium, potassium,
chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, magnesium, creatinine, glucose, calcium, cholesterol, carbon dioxide, oxygen, hematocrit), pulse, temperature, T-cell count, and the like.
<br/><br/> Various rating scales exist to measure medical conditions.  In addition to discrete scales such as asking whether the patient feels great/good/fair/poor/awful, numerical scales can be used which ask the patient to quantify one or aspects of
their medical condition, for example, on a 1-10 numerical scale.  The metric can be a composite metric that produces a numerical representation of the condition based on a series of measurements.  Rating scales for measuring depression include the Beck
Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Depression Ration Scale, and the Montgomery-.ANG.sberg Depression Rating Scale.  Rating scales for assessing ALS patients include the Appel ALS rating scale and the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS).  Rating scales
for Parkinson's Disease include the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).
<br/><br/> The medical condition metrics for a given user can be associated with a particular time.  For example, a user may report that the severity of her depression is a `7` on a scale from 1-10 at 9:00 AM on Jan.  1, 2009.  A plurality of associated
medical condition metrics and time data can be utilized to produce a chart 216a-216c (e.g., a line chart) as depicted in FIG. 2.
<br/><br/> Still referring to FIG. 2, charts 216a-216c can include information 218a, 218b about one or more interventions.  Such information can include dosing information for a medication (e.g., time and date and quantity) and/or pharmacokinetic data
regarding the concentration of a medication within the user over time.
<br/><br/> The specific medical condition metric(s), intervention(s), and/or time frame can be selected to compliment a particular user's posting.  For example, in posting 202a, user "BernieB" inquires about PROZAC.RTM..  Server 102 detects that the
posting concerns PROZAC.RTM., and includes information about the user's dosage history for PROZAC.RTM..  Server 102 can also infer that user's posting relates to depression.  This inference can be drawn based on a number of factors.  For example, the
user can be posting in a forum relating to depression.  In another example, server 102 consults a resource such as the Physicians' Desk Reference or the EPOCRATES.RTM.  database (available from Epocrates, Inc.  of San Mateo, Calif.) to determine
prescribing information for PROZAC.RTM.  (i.e., what indications PROZAC.RTM.  is approved for).  In yet another example, server 102 mines existing user information to detect "off-label" uses of various medications by other patients.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 2B, a variety of other information can be displayed along with postings 202.  For example, in posting 202d, the user-posted content 212d for user "Katerina" states that she has the D90A mutation.  Chart 216d is a schematic
showing the location of the D90A mutation on the SOD1 gene.
<br/><br/> In posting 202e, the user-posted content 212e for user "Katerina" states that that she recently quit her part-time job.  Chart 216e is a line chart depicting the user's work history.  Various color-coded bars and symbols denote periods where the
user was enrolled in an educational program, held a full-time job, and held a part-time job.
<br/><br/> In posting 202f, the user-posted content 212f for user "Phil" states that he has received support from his family.  Chart 216f is a line chart displaying the user's relationship status.  Color-coded bars of various thicknesses and symbols denote
periods where the user was single, in a relationship, married, and when the user's children where born.
<br/><br/> A variety of other information can be imported and displayed based on the user-posted content 212 in a posting 202.  For example, if the user-posted content 212 discusses the user's deployment as part of Operation Enduring Freedom--Afghanistan,
chart 216 may be a line chart representing the user's deployment history.  Relevant information can include rank, unit, combat status, and the like.  In another example, if the message board is of an academic nature, relevant publications or portions of
the user's curriculum vitae can be imported into the posting 202 based on the user-posted content 212.  Additionally, articles or portions of articles (e.g., an abstract) can be imported from variety of sources (e.g., PUBMED.RTM., available from The
National Library of Medicine of Bethesda, Md.; or THE NEW YORK TIMES.RTM., available from The New York Times Company of New York, N.Y.) and displayed in the thread.  Other media such as blogs, micro-blogs (e.g., TWITTER.RTM., available from Twitter, Inc. of San Francisco, Calif.), annotations, status updates (e.g., on a social networking site such as FACEBOOK.RTM., available from <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Inc.  of Palo Alto, Calif.), and the like can also be imported and displayed in the thread.
<br/><br/> The invention can also display one or one or more charts 216 displaying a variety of data relevant to posting.  For example, if the user-posted content 212 discusses lung cancer, a chart 218 can be produced containing information about the
user's environmental exposure (e.g., employment in a plant containing asbestos), the user's family history (e.g., in a family tree including information about cancer in user's ancestors), and the user's genetic profile.  Other environmental factors can
include weather information such as temperature, barometric pressure, precipitation, sunlight, and the like.  Other external data can be included such as the user's location, financial data (e.g., the performance of financial markets as reflected in
indexes such as the S&amp;P 500.RTM.  index available from Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation of New York, N.Y.), and the like.  Such external data can be particularly tailored to an individual user.  For example, a user can make available information about her
portfolio so that individualized financial data or an abstraction thereof can be presented along with information on the user's condition.
<br/><br/> The system can include privacy settings that allow a user to control how private information (e.g., medical history, financial history, and the like) is utilized.  Users can restrict all or certain information from being utilized in various
manners.  For example, a user can allow all of their data to be used to compute aggregate data, but restrict the viewing of certain data in the context of the particular user.
<br/><br/> By viewing a chart 216 with relevant user information, other users have additional context for viewing the user's posting 202.  For example, users can observe that BernieB's depression has not improved since commencing PROZAC.RTM..  Moreover,
other users can observe the duration and dosing level for user "BernieB" and provide commentary based on their dosing experiences.  For example, if a patient commented that PROZAC.RTM.  was not improving his depression, another user might observe from
the chart that the user has only taken PROZAC.RTM.  for two weeks, which can be an insufficient time to achieve a stable concentration in the user's body and comment accordingly.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the incorporation of relevant user information can counter any memory bias by the poster.  Presumably, users will have minimal, if any, motivation to exaggerate medical condition metrics as they experience them.  Therefore, this
data can serve to verify whether the user's recollection in a posting 202 is accurate, thereby enhancing the credibility of accurate postings 202 and calling into question inaccurate postings 202.
<br/><br/> Referring again to FIG. 2A, chart 216b in posting 202b confirms the poster's increased dosage of PROZAC.RTM., which is represented by a thicker line along the bottom of chart 216b, and the corresponding improvement in the user's depression,
which is represented by the downward slope of the line graph.
<br/><br/> Additionally or alternatively, the interactive environment can display information about the medical condition and/or intervention along with the posting.  For example, a message board can include links to information about depression and/or
PROZAC.RTM.  from sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, WebMD.RTM.  services, the Physicians' Desk Reference, the EPOCRATES.RTM.  database, and the like.
<br/><br/> The charts 216 can be interactive.  For example, a user can modify the visible time range of the chart 216.  Likewise, the user can hide one or more charts 216 or chart components.  A user can also "drill down" to view additional chart
components or the underlying data for chart 216, for example by clicking on chart 216.
<br/><br/> The visible time range can initially be calculated based on information in the message thread and/or the user viewing the thread.  For example, if the postings in the thread refer to the user's change in depressive symptoms during the winter,
each chart 216 can be configured to display a medical condition metric during the winter months.  In another alternative, the user asks about other users' experiences with PROZAC.RTM..  The charts 216 can be configured to display medical condition
metrics for the period after each user began taking PROZAC.RTM..
<br/><br/> User interactions with charts 218 can be stored and mined to rank the posting 202 and/or refine the chart.  For example, frequent clicks on chart 218 may indicate that chart is interesting to many users, which can result in the prominent display
of the posting 202.  Likewise, if a user views a chart 218 for a significant period of time, the posting may be interesting to many users.  In contrast, if many users hide the chart 218 or spend little time viewing the chart 218, the posting 202 may be
less interesting, resulting in a less prominent display.
<br/><br/> Users can also indicate the helpfulness of a posting 202 and/or chart through or more buttons and/or other GUI elements in interface 200.
<br/><br/> An aggregate chart can be displayed for a message thread.  The aggregate chart can include a plurality of sets and or average data for all users that made postings 202 in a thread.  Such an aggregate chart can provide valuable context about the
nature of the user's medical condition vis-a-vis other users in the thread.
<br/><br/> Identification of Relevant Information
<br/><br/> Relevant user information can be selected for importation in a variety of ways such as tagging or natural language processing.  Relevant user information can be identified automatically (i.e. without the necessity of human involvement).
<br/><br/> In a tagging method, one or more users can identify one or more relevant terms in the user-posted content 212.  This can occur in several ways.  For example, user can select one or more terms in the user interface 200 and press a button to tag
the one or more terms as "relevant." Additionally or alternatively, one or more administrators and/or moderators can tag relevant terms.  Terms can be tagged as relevant by the author of the posting 202 or another user.  More than one term can be tagged
in each posting 202.
<br/><br/> In contrast, FIG. 3 depicts a method for context-linked importation of user information through natural language processing.  Such a method can be implemented, for example, on server 102 as described herein.  In step S302, an interactive
environment (e.g., a message board) is provided.  In step S304, a message (e.g., a posting) is received from a pre-identified user.
<br/><br/> Users can be pre-identified through a variety of means known to those of skill in the art.  For example, users can enter a username and password when accessing the interactive environment.  In another example, a persistent object such as a
cookie in conventional Internet architectures and/or Local Stored Objects (LSOs) in FLASH.RTM.  or AIR.RTM.  platforms is stored on clients 104a-104c and act as an identifier.  Cookies are described in H. M. Deitel et al., Internet &amp; World Wide Web: How
to Program 1060-68 (2000).  The FLASH.RTM.  or AIR.RTM.  software platforms are available from Adobe Systems Incorporated of San Jose, Calif.
<br/><br/> In step S306, relevant data about the pre-identified user is selected.  In some embodiments, relevant data is selected based on contextual information mined from the message using preprocessing steps 306a-306c.  Preprocessing maps a report onto
a list of tokens that have linguistic meaning, i.e., words.  Preprocessing can include one or more of the following steps: tokenization (S306a), stop word removal (S306b), and lemmatization (S306c).
<br/><br/> Tokenization (S306a) separates punctuation from words.
<br/><br/> Stop words (also called "stopwords" or "noise words") are common words that appear in too many messages and therefore do not have discriminative power.  That is, stopwords cannot be used to capture the essence of a message such that one can
differentiate one message from another.  Standard lists of stop words are provided in software programs such as the SMART Information Retrieval System, available from Cornell University of Ithaca, N.Y.  The SMART stop word list is available at
ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/smart/english.stop.  A collection of stopwords for a particular set of documents can be created by selecting the words that occur in more than 80% of existing messages.  See R. Baeza-Yates &amp; B. Ribeiro-Neto, Modern
Information Retrieval .sctn.7.2 (1999).
<br/><br/> Lemmatization (S306b) maps each morphological variation of a word to its base form.  For example, the words, "go", "going", "went", and "gone" are lemmatized to "go", their root or base form.  Suitable lemmatizers include the WORDNET.RTM. 
system, available from Princeton University of Princeton, N.J.  Other lemmatizers can be used, including the MORPHA.TM.  software described in G. Minnen et al., "Applied morphological processing of English," 7(3) Natural Language Engineering 207-23
(2001) and available at http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/groups/nlp/carroll/morph.html.
<br/><br/> Once the message is preprocessed, relevant data can be selected based on the contextual information identified.  For example, if "blood pressure" was identified as contextual data, data about the user's blood pressure history (e.g., a chart) can
be selected.
<br/><br/> In step S308, relevant data about the user is displayed along with the message.
<br/><br/> In step S310, the database is updated with data from the message.  For example, the user might state in the message that they achieved an FRS score of 25 today.  This information can be extracted and added to the database in the same manner as
if the user had entered the information directly.
<br/><br/> In step S312, a response is received from another pre-identified user.  In steps S314-S318, relevant data is extracted from the response.  This relevant data can be used to (i) identify the author of the response, (ii) identify the subject(s) of
the response, and/or (iii) retrieve relevant information from a database to be displayed and/or posted to the database in the same or similar manner as discussed above.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 4, the invention herein can be embodied in a computer software and/or hardware system 400.  System 400 may contain one or more modules such as a messaging module 402, a data importation module 404, and/or an authentication
module 406.
<br/><br/> Messaging module 402 implements an interactive environment such as a message board.  Accordingly, messaging module 402 can provide an interactive environment as described herein, receive messages for the interactive environment, and display
relevant data along with the message on the interactive environment.
<br/><br/> In order to enhance the flexibility and adaptability of system 400, messaging module 402 can communicate with data importation module 404.  Data importation module 404 selects relevant data about a pre-identified user from the database based on
information contained in the message as discussed herein, for example in FIG. 3 and associated text.
<br/><br/> Messaging module 402 can also communicate with authentication module 406 to authenticate a pre-identified user.  For example, messaging module 402 can pass a user name and/or password to authentication module 406, which then authenticates the
user.  Alternatively, authentication module 406 may maintain a persistent authentication of the user and confirm such authentication when requested by messaging module 402.
<br/><br/> As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the modules 402, 404, 406 described herein can be implemented as components, i.e., functional or logical components with well-defined interfaces used for communication across
components.  For example, a system can be assembled by selecting a messaging component from several components (e.g., components that implement various approaches to message boards) and combining this component with a data importation component (e.g., a
data importation module designed for a specific type of data and/or database) and an authentication component (e.g., an authentication component designed for a specific type of authentication).
<br/><br/> Moreover, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the modules 402, 404, 406 described herein can be implemented using hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software.  For example, one or more modules can be
implemented on one or more general purposes computer containing appropriate software to implement the invention as described herein.
<br/><br/> Exemplary Data Entry User Interface
<br/><br/> The interactive environment can include an interface that allows a user to enter data such as intervention data or medical condition metric data.  This interface can be contained on the same page as a message board or can be accessible by a link
or as a pop-up window.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 5, an exemplary user interface 500 for data entry is provided.  Although user interface 500 is illustrated as customized for a patient suffering from Parkinson's disease, the principles explained and depicted herein are
equally applicable to any disease.
<br/><br/> User interface 500 includes a medical condition metric portion 502, which allows the patient to input a medical condition metric (in this example, the patient's functional ability).  The user can place multiple data points 504 in the medical
condition metric chart, which includes a time scale.  Data points 504 can be adjusted with respect to time and/or magnitude.  For example, if the patient is indicating how she feels now or at a designated time, the patient can be limited to moving data
point 504 up or down.  Alternatively, the patient can input data for a time by dragging the data point to the left or right.  The patient can be restricted from setting a data point in the future and/or the past.
<br/><br/> User interface 500 also includes an intervention portion 508.  Intervention portion 508 allows the patient to record one or more interventions such as administration of a medication, administration of a remedy, administration of a nutritional
supplement, administration of a vitamin, exercise, physical therapy, massage, stretching, consumption of food, rest, and sleep.  For example, the patient can designate when meals are eaten by adjusting bars 510a, 510b, 510c to indicate the beginning and
ending of the meal.  Likewise, the patient can indicate when one or more drugs 514a-514e are administered by placing markers 512 (which may depict pills) on a time scale.
<br/><br/> Various types of remedies can be scheduled for specific times.  For example, the patient can be prescribed to take MADOPAR.TM.  (levodopa; benserazide hydrochl) at 6:00 AM.  In this situation, user interface 500 can display a medication
schedule.  The patient can modify this schedule to reflect the actual administration by dragging marker 512a.  Likewise, the patient can indicate that the drug was consumed by clicking on the marker 512a.  Clicking on the marker can change the appearance
of the marker 512a (e.g., its color) and thus can be used by patients, particularly patients with memory problems, to more faithfully follow a medication program.
<br/><br/> User interface 500 can also include pharmacokinetic data, such a pharmacokinetic curve 516 that depicts the concentration of a medication within the patient over time.  Multiple pharmacokinetic curves 516 can be depicted in various colors or
patterns to reflect varying pharmacokinetic properties of various medications.  The pharmacokinetic curves can be generated using existing using formulas known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
<br/><br/> Slider Bar
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 6A-6D, a user interface for data entry is provided.  As in FIG. 5, a medical condition metric portion 602 is provided.  In FIG. 6A, the first medical condition metric is recorded for a day.  The patient either indicates that
she wishes to record a metric from 6:00 AM or accesses the user interface at 6:00 AM, at which point the user interface can default to 6:00 AM.  The patient manipulates slider bar 604 to input a medical condition metric.  For example, if the patient
wishes to indicate that `2` is the medical metric (e.g., a measurement of pain on a scale from 0-4), the user drags handle 606 of the slider bar 604 to the `2` position as depicted in FIG. 6A.
<br/><br/> Data point 608a can move up and down along vertical line 610a as the handle 606 is moved or data point 608a may not appear until the medical condition metric is finalized.  A metric can be "finalized" in a number of ways, including by clicking
the handle 606 to lock the handle 606.  Additionally or alternatively, the metric can be finalized by a period of inactivity, for example, about fifteen seconds, about thirty seconds, and about one minute.  In another alternative, data point 608a can
also be moved left or right to modify the time associated with the data point.
<br/><br/> As discussed in the context of FIG. 6A, the patient can indicate that he wishes to record metrics from 6:00 AM or can access the user interface at 6:00 AM at which point the user interface can default to 6:00 AM.  The patient can leave the user
interface open for a period of time and the patient can continue to access the user interface and manipulate the slider bar.  Each time the user manipulates the slider bar 604, a new data point can be set for the time that the slider bar 604 is
manipulated.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 6B, the patient enters a second medical condition metric.  The patient again moves the handle 606 of the slider bar 604.  If the system is configured so that the data point 608b moves with the handle 606, line segment 612a
also moves.  Thus, the patient can readily see whether he is indicating that a medical condition metric is improving or deteriorating and verify that such a change truly reflects their experience.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 6C, the patient again manipulates the slider bar 604 to enter a third data point 608c and form a new line segment 612b.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 6D, the patient indicates that the medical condition remains a `3` at 3:00 PM.  The slider bar handle 606 remains at the `3` position from the 12:00 PM data entry.  The patient can indicate that the metric remains a `3` by
clicking on the handle 606 to lock the slider bar 604.  During this, line segment 612c can grow horizontally from data point 608c as time progresses from 12:00 PM.  Otherwise, the slider bar handle 606 can disappear after data point 608c is set.  Handle
606 reappears when the patient clicks or moves the mouse over the slider bar 604.
<br/><br/> Application of Invention to Other User-Generated Content
<br/><br/> Although described in the context of an interactive environment, the invention is applicable to a variety of other applications.  Specifically, user information can be selectively imported based on user-generated content other than postings to
an interactive environment.
<br/><br/> In one example, users send private messages to each other.  Such private messages can be sent in real-time (analogous to instant messages) or can be sent and received asynchronously (analogous to email).  User information (e.g., information
about the sender or recipient) can be presented to the recipient along with the message.
<br/><br/> In another example, a patient can communicate with their physician to request and/or refill a prescription.  User information is selected based on the information in the request (e.g., the name of the prescription) and is presented to the
physician along with the request.
<br/><br/> Self-Updating Forums
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 7, the invention provides a self-updating forum 700.  In posting 702a, user "Robert" indicated that his doctor prescribed CYMBALTA.RTM.  (duloxetine) for his depression.
<br/><br/> Posting 702a includes a chart 716a.  Chart 716a can be configured to display one or more metrics as discussed herein along an x-axis spanning between the date of the posting 702a and the current date (Mar.  1, 2009 in the example depicted in
FIG. 7).  Thus, any viewer can assess how the poster's condition has developed without the need for (i) the poster returns to the forum to add a further posting or (ii) the reader to locate any subsequent posting(s).
<br/><br/> The ability of other users to view current information regarding the poster is reflected in posting 702b from user "Juanita" on Feb.  1, 2009.  User "Juanita" viewed chart 716a (spanning from Jun.  1, 2008 to Feb.  1, 2009 at the time) and could
visually appreciate that user Robert's condition had improved, as reflected in her posting 702b.  Juanita's posting 702b also includes a chart 716b depicting her steady condition.
<br/><br/> Incorporation in Blogs
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 8, embodiment of the invention can be applied to web logs (commonly referred to as "blogs").  A user interface 800 of a blog can include a post 802 and one or more comments 804.
<br/><br/> In the blog post 802, the author discusses her recent kidney transplant and discusses her BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine levels.  Software mines the blog post for terms of interest such as BUN and creatinine, queries a database or
other data source for relevant data, and generates one or more graphical elements 806a, 806b pertaining to the terms of interest in a similar manner to the methods described herein (e.g., method 300).  In the example depicted in FIG. 8, graphs of the
author's BUN and creatinine levels are depicted.
<br/><br/> One or more readers can post comments 804 to the blog 800.  Comments 804 can be mined for terms of interest in the same or similar manner as the blog post 802 and one or more graphical elements 808a, 808b can be associated with the comments 804.
<br/><br/>INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
<br/><br/> All patents, published patent applications, and other references disclosed herein are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties by reference.
<br/><br/>EQUIVALENTS
<br/><br/> Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents of the specific embodiments of the invention described herein.  Specifically, although this application periodically
discusses the application of the invention to "diseases", the invention is equally applicable to other medical events such as aging, fertility, and the like.  Moreover, the invention is not limited to medical events and conditions, but is applicable to
other topics such as athletic training, weight loss, academic performance, financial management, and the like.  Such equivalents are intended to be encompassed by the following claims.
