       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A system is provided that includes one or more computing servers and a
     processing circuit for monitoring data transactions of the computing
     servers. Each of the computing servers is configured to provide
     respective services to remote users. The processing circuit is configured
     to monitor data transactions of at least one of the computing servers,
     which is associated with a user account. A security policy of the user
     account includes a set of conditions that are indicative of unauthorized
     access when the conditions are satisfied by various characteristics of
     the monitored data. The processing circuit is configured to determine a
     threat level based on the characteristics of the data transactions and
     the conditions of the security policy. In response to the threat level
     exceeding a first threshold level indicated in the security policy of the
     user account, the processing circuit sends a notification to an
     authorized user of the user account.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The present disclosure describes various systems and devices for monitoring computing servers and providing alerts in response to detecting possible unauthorized access.  The disclosed embodiments are applicable to various different types of
computing servers including, e.g., VoIP servers, file servers, email servers, web servers, and virtual computing services.  For ease of explanation, the examples and embodiments herein are primarily described with reference to VoIP servers.  While the
disclosed embodiments are not necessarily limited to such applications, various aspects of the present disclosure may be appreciated through a discussion of various examples using this context.
<br/><br/> In some disclosed embodiments, a system is provided that includes one or more VoIP servers and a processing circuit, communicatively-coupled to the one or more VoIP servers, for monitoring data transactions of the computing servers.  Each of the
VoIP servers is configured to provide respective remote services to remote users.  The processing circuit is configured to monitor data transactions (e.g., VoIP calls and/or voice messaging accesses) of at least one of the VoIP servers, which is
associated with a user account.  A security policy of the user account includes a set of conditions that are indicative of unauthorized access when the conditions are satisfied by various characteristics of the monitored data transaction (e.g., frequency
of data transactions, size of data transaction, files accessed, cost of data transaction, and/or flag in the data packet of the transaction).  The processing circuit is configured to determine a threat level based on the characteristics of the data
transactions and the conditions of the security policy.  In response to the threat level exceeding a first threshold level indicated in the security policy of the user account, the processing circuit sends a notification to an authorized user of the user
account.
<br/><br/> The threat level may be determined based on a number of different aspects.  For example, in one embodiment, the threat level is determined based on a number of the conditions that are satisfied in the security policy.  In another embodiment,
different conditions of a security policy are associated with respective threat levels.  The threat level may be determined by determining the highest threat level of the conditions that are satisfied by the monitored data transactions.  In another
embodiment, the threat level is determined based on a level of sensitivity of files/services that are accessed by a data/transaction.  In another embodiment, the threat level of data transactions depends on the direction of the data transactions.  For
instance, for voice-mail services provided by a VoIP server, unauthorized downloads of data (e.g., stored voice-mail messages) may pose a larger threat than unauthorized uploads of data.  In contrast, in VoIP call services, unauthorized outgoing calls
(which may incur long distance charges) pose a larger threat than unauthorized reception of incoming calls (in which charges do not apply).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the processing circuit is further configured to monitor the data transactions and determine if characteristics of the data transactions are indicative of a system problem.  For instance, in some implementations,
characteristics indicative of a system problem may include excessive call jitter, dropped data packets, and/or network connectivity.  In response to characteristics of the data transactions being indicative of a system problem, the processing circuit
sends a notification to the authorized user of the user account and/or to a client associated with the monitored data transaction that indicated a system problem.  In some implementations, in response to the monitored data transactions exhibiting
characteristics indicative of a system problem, the processing circuit determines if the system problem is a server-side problem or a user-side problem.  In response to determining that the system problem is a server-side problem, the processing circuit
sends a notification to the authorized user of the user account.  Conversely, in response to determining that the system problem is a user-side problem, the processing circuit sends a notification to a remote user corresponding to one of the monitored
data transactions that was indicative of a system problem.
<br/><br/> The processing circuit may provide the notification(s) of possible unauthorized access and/or system problems using a number of different types of messages.  For instance, in some embodiments, the processing circuit is configured to provide an
SMS text message notification to one or more telephone numbers indicated in the security policy.  In some embodiments, the processing circuit is configured to send an automated voice call to the telephone number(s).  In some embodiments, the processing
circuit is configured to send an email notification to an email address indicated in the security policy.  In some embodiments, notifications are provided using other messaging services (e.g., <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> MySpace, Twitter, and/or Instant Messengers).  In
some implementations, multiple notifications are sent to multiple recipients and/or use multiple types of messages.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, notifications may be provided in real time as instances of unauthorized access and/or system problems are detected.  Some other embodiments avoid generating an overly burdensome number of notifications by filtering
notifications based on the frequency or number of the notifications.  For example, one implementation limits generation of notifications to a maximum frequency (e.g., one per hour) that is specified in the security policy.  Each notification may
summarize all instances of unauthorized access and/or system problems that have occurred since the last notification was sent.  As another example, some embodiments limit the number of notifications generated per day to a number indicated in the security
policy.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the processing circuit is configured to perform a first set of actions listed in the security policy, in response to the threat level exceeding a first threshold, to mitigate effects of unauthorized access.  For instance, in
response to the threat level exceeding a threshold, the processing circuit may block one or more users or disable one or more remote services provided by the VoIP server.  In some embodiments, the processing circuit may be configured to perform a second
set of actions in response to the threat level exceeding a second threshold.  For instance, the processing circuit may only alert an account manager in response to the threat level reaching a lower threshold and disable the VoIP server in response to the
threat level reaching a higher threshold.
<br/><br/> In one or more embodiments, the notification that is sent to an authorized user is configured to provide a mechanism for a user to select from one or more possible actions.  For instance, in one implementation, an email or SMS text message may
include a web address link to a webpage from which a user may select an action to take.
<br/><br/> In another implementation, a user may select a desired action by responding to an SMS text message with a text message indicating the selected action.
<br/><br/> The security policy may be configured, based on user requirements, to include a number of different conditions to detect unauthorized access.  For example, some conditions may detect possible unauthorized access based on frequency of data
transactions.  For instance, the security policy may include a condition that indicates unauthorized access may have occurred when the frequency of data transactions (e.g., number of transactions per hour) exceeds a threshold indicated in the security
policy.  This type of detection may be useful, for example, to detect call-loops between data carriers.  In some implementations, the threshold is a fixed threshold.  In some other implementations, the threshold adapts based on an average frequency of
data transfers.  For instance, the condition may be satisfied (indicate unauthorized access) when the frequency of data transactions surpasses a stored average for the account by a threshold amount indicated in the security policy.
<br/><br/> As another example, some conditions may detect possible unauthorized access based on the size of the data transactions or total number of transactions.  For instance, the security policy may include a condition that indicates unauthorized access
may have occurred when the size of a data transaction exceeds a threshold transaction size in the security policy.  Similarly, the security policy may include a condition that indicates unauthorized access may have occurred when a daily data transfer
limit is exceeded.  Conditions may place a data transfer limit on each user of a VoIP server or on the total amount of data transferred by a VoIP server.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, one or more conditions may detect possible unauthorized access based on the location of a user of the VoIP server.  For instance, the security policy may include a condition that indicates unauthorized access may have
occurred when a user logs into a monitored VoIP server from an IP address outside of an IP address range corresponding to a block of IP addresses.  For example, a condition may indicate that a user is unauthorized if an IP address of a user is outside a
block of IP addresses used by a company.  As another example, a condition may indicate that a user is unauthorized if the IP address of the user indicates that the user is located outside of the country.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, possible unauthorized access may be indicated by flags set in one or more data packets of a data transaction.  For instance, another data carrier may set flags in response to detecting possible call loops.  When the call is
forwarded to a VoIP server from the other data carrier, the flag can notify the VoIP server of the possible call loop.  The VoIP server can further analyze the call to determine if a call loop has occurred and/or take remedial measures.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, one or more conditions detect possible unauthorized access using access control mechanisms (passwords, challenge questions, authentication keys).  For instance, the security policy may include a condition that indicates
unauthorized access may have occurred when a number of failed login attempts exceeds a limit indicated in the security policy.
<br/><br/> The settings of a security policy (e.g., conditions for detecting unauthorized access, threshold levels, and actions to take in response to a threshold being reached) may be adjusted based on the requirements of the computing servers that are
monitored.  In some embodiments, the processing circuit is configured to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that may be used to adjust settings of the security policy.
<br/><br/> Turning now to the figures, FIG. 1 shows a telecommunication network including a plurality of computing servers (140, 142, 146), each configured to provide remote services to various end-point devices including, e.g., mobile devices 150,
plain-old telephones (POTS) 122, computer(s) 126, IP phones 128.  The computing servers may provide a variety of different remote services.  In this example, the network includes a VoIP server 140, a file server 142, and an application server 146 (e.g.,
virtual machine service).  Data transactions related to the remote services are communicated between the computing servers and the remote users over various data networks including, e.g., the internet 112, public service telephone networks 102, and
private data networks (e.g., LAN 130, WiFi network 124, and/or Private Branch Exchange servers (not shown)).
<br/><br/> In this example, the VoIP server 140 is monitored by a processing circuit(s) (e.g., network monitor 144) which is communicatively-coupled thereto and configured to detect possible unauthorized access of the VoIP server.  The
communicative-coupling of the VoIP server 140 and network monitor 144 may include either a direct connection or an indirect connection having, e.g., multiple connections, relay nodes, and/or networks in a communication path between the VoIP server 140
and network monitor 144.  The network monitor is configured to determine a threat level for the monitored server based on a set of conditions in a security polity that are indicative of unauthorized access.  In response to the threat level reaching a
threshold level indicated in the security policy, the network monitor sends a threat notification to an authorized user (e.g., an account manager) indicated in the security policy.  As indicated above, the network monitor 144 processing circuit may
provide the notification of possible unauthorized access using one or more different types of messages including, e.g., SMS text messages, email, voice recording, instant messaging, and/or social network messaging services.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 shows an alert system configured in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.  In this example, the system includes a plurality of VoIP servers and a processing circuit (network monitor 230) for monitoring data
transactions of the VoIP servers.  Each of the VoIP servers is configured to provide respective VoIP services (e.g., VoIP calls, voice messaging, and/or VoIP conference recording/transcription) to remote users (e.g., 202 and 204).  Data transactions of
the services are communicated between the VoIP servers (222, 224, and 226) and the remote users (202 and 204) over one or more networks (e.g., internet 210).  As described above, the network monitor 230 is configured to monitor data transactions of at
least one of the computing servers, which is associated with a user account.  In this example, the network monitor 230 is configured to monitor data transactions of three VoIP servers (222, 224, and 226).  However, in various embodiments the network
monitor may be configured to monitor any number of computing servers and/or different types of computing servers (providing different services).  The VoIP servers (222, 224, and 226) and network monitor 230 may be implemented as different applications on
the same computing processor, or may be implemented on separate processors and/or at different locations (e.g., in a cloud computing environment).
<br/><br/> As described above, a security policy of the user account includes a set of conditions that are indicative of unauthorized access when the conditions are satisfied by various characteristics of the monitored data transaction (e.g., frequency of
data transactions, size of data transaction, files accessed, and cost of data transaction).  The network monitor is configured to determine a threat level, based on the characteristics of the data transactions and the conditions of the security policy. 
In response to the threat level exceeding a first threshold level indicated in the security policy of the user account, the network monitor provides a notification to an account manager (or other authorized user).  As discussed with reference to FIG. 1,
alerts may be provided to an account manager using a number of different types of messages including, e.g., SMS text messages, emails, voice recordings, instant messengers, and or social network messaging services.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 shows an example process for monitoring a VoIP server for unauthorized access in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.  In response to a new data transaction 302 to/from a VoIP server, it is first determined
whether a security policy is associated with the corresponding VoIP server.  If no security policy is associated with the VoIP server at decision step 304, the process exits.  Otherwise, the process determines if characteristics of the data transaction
satisfy conditions in the security policy at block 308.  As indicated above, the conditions are indicative of possible unauthorized access when satisfied by the characteristics of the data transaction.
<br/><br/> If no conditions of the security policy are satisfied at decision step 310, the process exits.  Otherwise, if one or more conditions of the security policy are satisfied, a threat level is determined at block 312.  The threat level may be
determined based on a number of different aspects.  For example, in one implementation, the threat level is determined based on a number of the conditions that are satisfied in the security policy and character.  For instance, a larger number of
conditions indicative of unauthorized access that are satisfied may indicate a greater threat.  As another example, different conditions of a security policy may be associated with different threat levels.  For instance, different conditions may have
different likelihoods of being satisfied.  Further, possible adverse effects of the types of unauthorized accesses indicated by the respective conditions may have differing levels of severity.  In some embodiments, the threat level may be determined by
determining the highest threat level of the conditions that are satisfied by the monitored data transactions.  In another embodiment, the threat level is determined based on an aggregate of the threat levels of the satisfied conditions.  In another
embodiment, the threat level is determined based on a level of sensitivity of files/services that are accessed by a data/transaction.  In another embodiment, threat level of data transactions depends on the direction of the data transaction.  The threat
level may be determined based on a combination of the above and other factors.
<br/><br/> If the determined threat level is low enough at decision step 314, such that a first threshold of the security policy is not exceeded, the process exits.  Otherwise, in response to the threat level exceeding the first threshold, a
notification/alert is provided to an authorized user (e.g., account manager) at block 316.  In some embodiments, the process automatically performs one or more actions in response to the threat level exceeding one or more threat levels.  For instance, as
shown in FIG. 3, in response to the threat level exceeding a second threshold, at decision block 318, the process performs one or more actions indicated in the security policy at block 320.  In some embodiments, the process may perform additional actions
in response to additional respective thresholds being exceeded by the determined threat level.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 shows an example process for providing an alert to an authorized user of a VoIP server account based on the threat level of the unauthorized access in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.  In response to a
threat threshold being exceeded by the determined threat level 402, an authorized user of the account is notified at block 404.  As indicated above, notification may be performed using one or more different types of messages including, e.g., SMS text
messages, email, voice recording, instant messaging, and/or social network messaging services.
<br/><br/> In this example, optional actions that may be taken are retrieved from the security policy at block 406.  The options are presented to a user and the user is prompted to select an action to be taken at block 408.  For example, in some
embodiments, the notification to the user may indicate the options and provide a mechanism for the user to select an action to be taken.  For instance, in one implementation, options are presented in a text message and the desired action is selected by
replying to the text message with one of a plurality of designated responses.
<br/><br/> In the example shown in FIG. 4, a user is presented with four options (ignore, remove alert, action 1, or action 2).  If the ignore option is selected by a user, at decision block 412, the alert is turned off at block 414 and the process exits. 
If the remove alert option is selected by a user, at decision block 416, the condition that triggered the alert is removed from the security policy.  This option may be helpful to allow an account manager to use a default security policy and remove
unnecessary conditions from the security policy as alerts are triggered.  The security policy may also be configured to indicate a number of other actions (e.g., action 1 and action 2) that may be taken by a user in response to different threshold levels
being exceeded.  If action 1 is selected by a user, at decision block 420, a first action indicated in the security policy is performed at block 422.  Similarly, if action 2 is selected by a user, at decision block 424, a second action indicated in the
security policy is performed at block 426.  If no action is selected by a user, the process exits.
<br/><br/> The various embodiments as discussed herein may be implemented using a variety of structures and related operations/functions.  For instance, one or more embodiments as described herein may be computer-implemented or computer-assisted, as by
being coded as software within a coding system as memory-based codes or instructions executed by a computer processor, microprocessor, PC or mainframe computer.  Such computer-based implementations are implemented using one or more programmable circuits
that include at least one computer-processor and internal/external memory and/or registers for data retention and access.  One or more embodiments may also be implemented in various other forms of hardware such as a state machine, programmed into a
circuit such as a field-programmable gate array, or implemented using electronic circuits such as digital or analog circuits.  In addition, various embodiments may be implemented using a tangible storage medium, which stores instructions that, when
executed by a processor, performs one or more of the steps, methods or processes described herein (e.g., the processor is configured via the instructions).  These applications and embodiments may also be used in combination; for instance, certain
functions can be implemented using discrete logic (e.g., a digital circuit) that generates an output that is provided as an input to a processor.
