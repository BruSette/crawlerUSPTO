       <p> A method for quantifying localness of content can be organized into
     several stages of information acquisition and processing, with each stage
     focusing on filtering or qualifying content based on geographic
     information relevant to a place. The method may comprise bootstrapping an
     initial set of terms for the place, building a local content corpus for
     the place utilizing the initial set of terms, and populating an index
     with information from documents in the local content corpus. In response
     to a request about the place, a query is formed and provided to the index
     for retrieving local content relevant to the place.

<br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> This disclosure relates generally to online search and social media.  More particularly, embodiments disclosed herein relate to a system, method, and computer program product for discovering, curating, and editing online local content.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED ART
<br/><br/> Social media and Internet technologies have enabled any computer user, local organizations and small business to easily publish content.  Blogging, Twitter and <b><i>Facebook</i></b> have become the main channels for user content publication.  Local
organizations, libraries and local businesses have transitioned their communications from physical media: newspapers, physical bulletin boards, fliers and Yellow Pages to informational websites and more recently social media outlets to attempt to connect
with their audiences.
<br/><br/> Although information publication has become relatively easy due to web-publication technologies, reaching geographically local users continues to be difficult due to the content discovery mechanism driven by Internet search engines.
<br/><br/> A search engine indexes, collects, parses, and stores data to facilitate fast access and relevant information retrieval.  Search engines incorporate interdisciplinary concepts from linguistics, cognitive psychology, mathematics, informatics,
physics, and computer science.
<br/><br/> Today, leading search engine providers use a variety of algorithms to index and retrieve information based on user keyword search.  To enable a general search service applicable to all web users, these search engines index and rank content based
on general mathematical properties, including web page link analysis in order to determine the likely most relevant content based on key words provided by the user.  The number of external links to a given web page affects the ranking of the web page
within search results.  Users are presented content in "rank order" based on the score determined by the search engine's indexing algorithms.
<br/><br/> Unfortunately, traditional Internet search must index an extremely large number of web pages and this limits the type of algorithms that can be applied.  These algorithms tend to be extremely general and large amounts of content that might be
relevant do not appear within given search results, as they are not linked by other sites on the web.  Due to the fact content that is highly geographical topical (local content) competes with the entire body of Internet content for rank positioning.  In
general, the more local the web page, the fewer external links the content is likely to have.  For every position lower on the search rank, a user is 10% less likely to click through a link.  Content is effectively buried when ranked off the first page
of search results.
<br/><br/> For example, if user searches for the terms "Italian food", search engines return the set of all ranked content on the Internet of "Italian Food".  Recently, search engines have attempted to improve search relevancy by geo-locating users via IP
address and narrowing a user's search by adding the user's location context to their searches and providing more geographically targeted search results.  This change enables local content to better compete against Internet wide content.  However, users
still have to "guess" the best search terms when attempting to find local data and the data is presented as a long list of disconnected items.  Consequently, there is always room for innovations and improvements.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
<br/><br/> Embodiments disclosed herein provide a new system, method, and computer program product for creating one or more self-editing content streams based on geographic information, web crawling and machine learning.  The system can be automated or
semi-automated.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the system is configured to learn the "local flavor" of content and can deploy automated editors for each community serviced by the system.  In some embodiments, these automated editors can discover who publishes content
locally, what is locally interesting to the local audience, and then generate, on an ongoing basis, streams of content based on the learned place interest.  There is a large amount of local content hidden on the Internet and by mining this content and
creating and automated editing facility, end-users can be presented with best local content available on the Internet for their area.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the system may comprise one or more server machines, a geographic database, and at least one non-transitory computer readable medium storing instructions translatable by the one or more server machines to implement a method
comprising particular steps performed at various stages.
<br/><br/> At a first stage, the method may comprise bootstrapping an initial set of terms for a particular place utilizing the geographic database.  This bootstrapping process can be performed for every place in the geographic database.  The geographic
database may contain geographic information and spatial data.  Local entity weighting data can be stored and associated with geo points, line or polygon data types, and may have an associated spatial reference system.
<br/><br/> At a second stage, the method may comprise building a local content corpus for the particular place utilizing the initial set of terms from the first stage.  The local content corpus containing contents such as documents that are particularly
relevant with respect to the particular place.  At this stage, a local content corpus (also referred to as a local corpus) may be built for every place, geo space, or geo point in the geographic database.
<br/><br/> At a third stage, the method may comprise populating an index with information from the local content corpus.  The index contains relevancy of all the contents with respect to the place.  The index can be used to retrieve content that is local
and relevant to the particular place.
<br/><br/> Documents that have been placed in a local corpus may not be ranked relative to the place or to each other.  Instead, they may be ranked in real time utilizing a weighting function.  For example, in response to a request about a place, documents
that have been placed in a local corpus for the place may be ranked based on "local terms" (local entities) in the documents.  These "local terms" are deemed to be associated with that particular place relative to the entire body of text outside the
place.
<br/><br/> The request about the place may come from a browsing application or mobile app running on a client device connected to the one or more server machines.  Software running on the one or more server machines may form a query to an indexing engine
or search platform.  In response to the query, the system may dynamically rank the documents in the local content corpus with respect to search parameters in the query and relative to the place.
<br/><br/> The system may perform, on an ongoing basis, targeted web crawling for additional content local to every place in the geographic database.  Once content is acquired and indexed, supervised content curating may be conducted.  The system may be
configured to collect categorization votes that selectively categorize indexed content based on target content categories.  The categorization votes can be used to automatically classify new documents.  An automated editing process may be configured to
traverse a place hierarchy and to edit content pulled from the index to meet editing targets.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The disclosure and various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the exemplary, and therefore non-limiting, embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following
description.  It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and the specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiments, are given by way of illustration only and not by way of limitation.  Descriptions of known programming
techniques, computer software, hardware, operating platforms and protocols may be omitted so as not to unnecessarily obscure the disclosure in detail.  Various substitutions, modifications, additions and/or rearrangements within the spirit and/or scope
of the underlying inventive concept will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure.
<br/><br/> Software implementing embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented in suitable computer-executable instructions that may reside on a computer-readable storage medium.  Within this disclosure, the term "computer-readable storage medium"
encompasses all types of data storage medium that can be read by a processor.  Examples of computer-readable storage media can include, but are not limited to, volatile and non-volatile computer memories and storage devices such as random access
memories, read-only memories, hard drives, data cartridges, direct access storage device arrays, magnetic tapes, floppy diskettes, flash memory drives, optical data storage devices, compact-disc read-only memories, and other appropriate computer memories
and data storage devices.
<br/><br/> Before discussing embodiments of invention, a hardware architecture where embodiments disclosed herein can be implemented is described with reference to FIG. 1.  In FIG. 1, network computing environment 100 may comprise network 150.  Network 150
can represent a private network, a public network, or a virtual private network (VPN).  A company's intranet might be an example of a private network and the Internet might be an example of a public network.  A VPN uses primarily public telecommunication
infrastructure, such as the Internet, to provide remote users with a way to access an internal network of an organization or entity.  Various types of networks are known to those skilled in the art and thus are not further describe Network 150 can be
bi-directionally coupled to a variety of networked systems, devices, repositories, etc.
<br/><br/> In the simplified configuration shown in FIG. 1, network 150 comprises a plurality of computers and/or machines 110A-N. Computers 110A-N may comprise at least a server machine and a client machine.  Virtually any piece of hardware or electronic
device capable of running client software and communicating with a server can be considered a client machine.  As an example, computer 110A may include a central processing unit (CPU) 101, read-only memory (ROM) 103, random access memory (RAM) 105, hard
drive (HD) or non-volatile memory 107, and input/output (I/O) device(s) 109.  An I/O device may be a keyboard, monitor, printer, electronic pointing device (e.g., a mouse, trackball, touch pad, etc.), or the like.  The hardware configuration of computer
110A can be representative to other devices and computers alike coupled to network 150 (e.g., desktop computers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants, handheld computers, cellular phones, and any electronic devices capable of storing and
processing information and network communication).  Computer 110B may implement an embodiment of a system disclosed herein and may connect to database 130 and computer 110A via network 150.  In some embodiments, database 130 may be accessible by computer
110B locally.  For example, database 130 and computer 110B may reside on a private network or a company's intranet.  Database 130 may store data used by the system in computing environment 100.  In some embodiments, database 130 may reside on computer
110B.  In some embodiments, computer 110B may send information to computer 110A over network 150 and computer 110A may operate to present the information to a user of computer 110A.
<br/><br/> As one skilled in the art can appreciate, the exemplary architecture shown and described herein with respect to FIG. 1 is meant to be illustrative and not limiting.  Further, embodiments disclosed herein may comprise suitable software including
computer-executable instructions.  As one skilled in the art can appreciate, a computer program product implementing an embodiment disclosed herein may comprise one or more non-transitory computer readable storage media storing computer instructions
translatable by one or more processors in computing environment 100.  Examples of computer readable media may include, but are not limited to, volatile and non-volatile computer memories and storage devices such as ROM, RAM, HD, direct access storage
device arrays, magnetic tapes, floppy diskettes, optical storage devices, etc. In an illustrative embodiment, some or all of the software components may reside on a single computer or on any combination of separate computers.
<br/><br/> As discussed above, using the IP geo-locating methodology, online local content can better compete against the entire body of content available on the Internet, but users still have to "guess" the best search terms when attempting to find local
data and the data is presented as a long list of disconnected items.  Also, due to the low resolution of IP geo-locating, current geographic search results tend to include only city level qualified content, which makes neighborhood or address level
search based on a user's current IP address impossible outside the realm of mobile devices.
<br/><br/> Today, to discover local information a search user continues to be confronted with guessing appropriate search terms for a given locality.  This is a key usability problem.  Users need to know an area before they can guess good search terms for
that area.  However, users cannot get to know an area without knowing good terms.  Guided content discovery can help users bridge this search term gap by using their geographical affiliation to deliver edited content about the area of interest, which
enables efficient local content discovery.
<br/><br/> For the perspective of local content provider, however, this presents another problem.  Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the visibility of a website or a web page in search engines via the "natural" or un-paid
("organic" or "algorithmic") search results.  Savvy content providers and publishers alike often attempt to organize their content in a way that influences the ranking in search engine results.  For example, they may embed keywords and links in their
content to drive up their content's relative ranking within search engine results.  Competition for ranking has become highly specialized beyond the level of sophistication for most local content providers.
<br/><br/> Recognizing the intrinsic need for local content, embodiments disclosed herein provide a system for automated discovering, curating, and editing local content.  The system can enable local content publishers to better reach local content
consumers.  Additionally, local content can be provided in context with other local content to facilitate user information discovery.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the system can be organized into several stages of information acquisition and processing, with each stage focusing on filtering or qualifying content based on geographic information.  FIG. 2 illustrates an example method
200 implementing an embodiment of the system comprising first stage 210, second stage 220, and third stage 230.  As will be described in further detail below, method 200 may comprise, bootstrapping an initial set of terms for a place at first stage 210,
building a local content corpus for the place at second stage 220 utilizing the initial set of terms for the place from first stage 210, and populating an index at third stage 230 with information from the documents in the local content corpus.
<br/><br/> Within this disclosure, a place can be any named area where a user has a primary affiliation.  For example, for cities a named area can be a neighborhood; whereas, for small towns, a named area can be a town or municipality itself.  In order
classify content relative to place, in some embodiments, the system can be built to enable near constant time classification of content.  As will be further described below, this approach can be based on a local entity weighting approach for content
classification.
<br/><br/> The system allows self-edited content to be created from general content templates based on web crawling and machine learning algorithms.  These content templates are based on likely interest areas and can be customized by the end-user.  In this
context, "self" refers to the system.  Editing is the process of reviewing and then condensing, correcting or arranging written material, images, sound, video, or film with the objective of preparing it for final presentation.  As an editor, the system
uses its understanding of the audience to determine the best content for publication.  The system approximates, simulates, and automates the editing process by discovering who publishes content locally, what is locally interesting to the local audience
then generating, on an ongoing basis, streams of content based on the learned place interest.
<br/><br/> The system also finds the relationships amongst data based on learning and/or finding common patterns of information in the content.  The relationships amongst data enable content tapestries to be created which, in turn, enables a user to see
content in its local context.
<br/><br/> At this point, a few observations can be made: Local content is local because of the "subjects" of the content.  A subject of the content is a function of the entities (associated terms) that make up that content.  Local content is anchored
around local people, places and things of interest.  These subjects of interest tend to relatively constant and mainly oriented around local geography.  Examples of local places of interest may include, but are not limited to: Local businesses, schools,
parks, streets, churches, etc. Content that contains references to these features can be locally relevant and the content from an area tends to have references to other local subjects and links to other web pages with local subjects.  Given a large
metropolitan area, the amount of content created within that given locality can be proportional to the density of the population.  Web content publication continues to grow rapidly.  Features that anchor content establish the place affinity for a given
location.  Place affinity can vary broadly due to depending social, urban planning and historical.  The relevancy of local content can vary exponentially with the distance to the audience.  For example, crime information can be extremely relevant in a
0.25-mile radius versus crime information about 5 miles away.  Local content by its nature can become uninteresting outside its immediate local context.  Local content can be boundary sensitive in that boundaries of neighborhoods and places can play as
an important role to content relevancy as the distance proximity.  Local content sources publish on irregular basis due to that fact the blogs and tweets about the local area are often done by authors as a side-hobby.  Trying to base a content stream on
any single source will not provide a regular enough content stream to be compelling for the user.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the system may leverage enabling technologies.  One example may be keyword search implementing a search algorithm.  In computer science, a search algorithm, broadly speaking, is an algorithm for finding an item with
specified properties among a collection of items.  Another example may be geotagging.  Geotagging is the process of adding geographical identification metadata to various media such as photographs, video, websites, SMS messages, or RSS feeds (described
below) and is a form of geospatial metadata.  This data usually consist of latitude and longitude coordinates, though they can also include altitude, bearing, distance, accuracy data, and place names.  Geotagging is commonly used for photographs, giving
geotagged photographs.  The amount of geotagged data is growing due to the adoption of personal mobile devices.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the system may leverage known standards, including Internet publication standards which have emerged to enable easy interchange of content between parties.  One example is RSS (most commonly expanded as Really Simple
Syndication) which is a family of web feed formats used to publish frequently updated works--such as blog entries, news headlines, audio, and video--in a standardized format.  An RSS document (which can be called a "feed", "web feed", or "channel")
includes full or summarized text, plus metadata such as publishing dates and authorship.  Web feeds benefit publishers by letting them syndicate content automatically.  They benefit readers who want to subscribe to timely updates from favored websites or
to aggregate feeds from many sites into one place.  RSS feeds can be read using software called an "RSS reader", "feed reader", or "aggregator", which can be web-based, desktop-based, or mobile-device-based.  A standardized XML file format allows the
information to be published once and viewed by many different programs.  The user subscribes to a feed by entering into the reader the feed's URI or by clicking a feed icon in a web browser that initiates the subscription process.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the system utilizes an indexing engine to build and index all the local content.  Features of this indexing engine may include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database
integration, and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF, etc.) handling.  Enabled by the indexing engine's distributed search and index replication functionality, the system can be highly scalable and can support virtually unlimited content queries.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 depicts a diagrammatic representation of one example embodiment of a system architecture showing all the services required by the system.  Each service in system 300 can be run as a stand-alone entity or as a separate process connecting
through networked inter-process communication.  Services in system 300 can be communicatively connected to Internet content sources 310 via application programming interfaces (APIs) 320.  Content acquisition 330 and key word bootstrap 325 may operate on
various contents obtained from Internet content sources 310 through APIs 320.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, key word bootstrap 325 may be configured to perform bootstrapping an initial set of terms for a place at first stage 210.  Given any populated area, there exists a set of well-known geographic places.  By using a geographic
database (also referred to herein as a geodatabase), key word bootstrap 325 can automatically create a set of keyword search terms.
<br/><br/> A geodatabase is a database designed to store, query, and manipulate geographic information and spatial data of low dimensionality.  Within a spatial database, spatial data is treated as any other data type.  Local entity weighting data can be
stored and associated with geo point, line or polygon data types, and may have an associated spatial reference system.  One primary advantage of spatial databases, over file-based data storage, is that a geographic information system (GIS) can be built
on the existing capabilities of relational database management systems (RDBMS).  This gives an otherwise standard database an ability to retrieve geospatial query terms and includes support for SQL and the ability to generate complex geospatial queries. 
Also, a database's client/server architecture supports multiple users simultaneously and lets them view, edit, and query the database without conflict.
<br/><br/> A geodatabase record can use a geometry data type to represent the location of an object in the physical world and other standard database data types to store the object's associated attributes.
<br/><br/> As an example, geodatabase 350 may contain state, municipality, macro area and neighborhood name data.  Note, however, geography boundaries are not limited to any set of real-state boundaries.  Boundaries can include any affiliation that exists
as a function of user location.  These boundaries include school districts, political, municipal zoning, etc. By leveraging these key word search terms based on key words based on boundaries and their name hierarchy and geo-spatial queries based on
boundary polygons an initial content data stream to be created for a given set of boundaries.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, geodatabase 350 may hold a set of all geo-spatial polygons associated with places.  This database also contains a place hierarchy.  In one embodiment, geographic places can be arranged in the place hierarchy where each level
represents a geographic level.  For example, a U.S.  address can be represented to reflect a geographic hierarchy for the purpose of efficient postal routing.  More specifically, suppose a U.S.  address is as follows: 1813 Clifford Ave Austin, Tex. 
78702 U.S.A.
<br/><br/> The address starts with the street, which is the lowest level of a geographic hierarchy, followed by the city then the state and then the country.  Oriented in a parent-to-child order the address would read: U.S.A., Tex., Austin, 1813 Clifford
Ave
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 depicts general hierarchy 400 representing this hierarchy as graph.  This hierarchy represents a geographical containment hierarchy, where each level of the hierarchy contains the subsequent contained or child levels.  These hierarchies
are strictly partitioned where no geographic place overlaps any other within the same level of the hierarchy within a boundary class (real-estate, school district, city-political).
<br/><br/> Local geographies decompose further into areas oriented around neighborhoods in most metropolitan areas.  These local geographies are mainly a function of real-estate boundaries and socio-economic factors that partition populations within
cities.  As such, this hierarchy encodes important social context that enable a reasonably targeted automated key word search to prime content acquisition.  FIG. 5A depicts local hierarchy 500 and FIG. 5B depicts an example of local hierarchy 500 that
captures a neighborhood located in Austin, Tex.
<br/><br/> This hierarchy further qualifies where Rosewood neighborhood resides by providing the macro area, "East Side" as its parent.  "East Side" refers to a section of Austin that is distinct from other sections of Austin.
<br/><br/> In many cities, this macro-level decomposition reflects the compass directional (North, South East, West, etc.).  However, many cities may have districts that exist due to real-estate development or area history.
<br/><br/> The system can therefore be organized around places, each representing a named area where a user has a primary affiliation.  For cities this can be the neighborhood and for small towns this can be the town or municipality itself.  Place
affiliation can be a key to enabling effective content acquisition.  When a user provides the system with their address, the user is implicitly providing a rich context for the system to base automated content acquisition.  In some embodiments, these
places groups can be defined by local boundaries below the city level.  The system can be designed to operate best in the most specific local context.
<br/><br/> Currently, there is not a 100% reliable source for local boundaries (i.e., boundaries below the city level).  In order to drive content acquisition efficacy, the system can be connected with local information sources to compile local boundary
information for areas where the system is deployed.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, by applying the following algorithm an initial set of "bootstrap" content can be generated.  The content is referred to as "bootstrap" as it requires no a priori knowledge of an area, other than local geographic hierarchy.
<br/><br/>Example
<br/><br/>Geo-Place Key Word Generation Algorithm
<br/><br/> .A-inverted.(.rho.): .rho.  is a place group {.rho..epsilon.place groups below the city level}
<br/><br/> visit (.rho.)
<br/><br/> let keyword search terms=
<br/><br/> concat(name(.rho.), name(macro(.rho.)), name(city(.rho.))
<br/><br/> where .rho.  is a place group in the geo hierarchy
<br/><br/> where visit
<br/><br/> traversal through the geo-hierarchy to .rho.  with .rho.: (attributes of v: name level parent, children)
<br/><br/> where concat (a.sub.0, a.sub.1 .  . . a.sub.n)string concatenation of a.sub.0, a.sub.1 .  . . a.sub.n
<br/><br/> where macro(.rho.)the macro area group containing .rho.
<br/><br/> where city(.rho.)the city or municipality group
<br/><br/> containing .rho.
<br/><br/> With this initial set of local search terms, a set of keyword searches can be generated automatically for any place.  These initial terms enable a bootstrap content stream to be created for any given place where the system is deployed.
<br/><br/> Key word searches based on this algorithm enable an initial set of priming content (or corpus) to be created for the system (e.g., at stage 220).  This priming content establishes the initial body of content that the system will use to begin to
baseline content relevancy.  The system leverages Bayesian probability that local content for a place will have local entities with a higher relative probability.
<br/><br/> To generate a local corpus, the system first generates local content streams from each of the top-level content data sources and aggregators using the bootstrap keyword search terms.  Place-based keyword search and geo-spatial search based on
local boundaries allow the system to build up, for each place in the system, a body of content relative to the place (place corpus).
<br/><br/> This place corpus provides the system with an importance of "local terms" (local entities) associated with a given place relative to the entire body outside a given local area.  This importance can be determined using TFIDF (term
frequency-inverse document frequency) weighting.  The TFIDF weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus and can be used in information retrieval and text mining.  The importance
increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus.  One example of TFIDF weighting algorithm is as follows:
<br/><br/> .A-inverted.(.rho.): .rho.  is a place group {.rho..epsilon.place groups below the city level}
<br/><br/> .A-inverted.(cs): {cs: content source providing key word search} let content stream of .rho.=keyword search (cs, keywords of .phi.  .A-inverted.(t): {t: term in content stream--{st: stop words}}
<br/><br/> .times..times..function..times.  ##EQU00001## with |D|: cardinality of D, or the total number of documents in the place corpus |{d: t.sub.i.epsilon.d}|: number of documents where the term t.sub.i appears (that is n.sub.i,j.noteq.0).  If the term
is not in the corpus, this will lead to a division-by-zero.  It is therefore common to use 1+|{d:t.sub.i.epsilon.d}| Then (tf-idf).sub.i,j=tf.sub.i,j.times.idf.sub.i where .rho.  is a place group in the geo hierarchy.
<br/><br/> In order to classify content relative to place, the system enables near constant time O(1) automated classification of content.  This approach is based on a local entity weighting model approach for content classification.  In system 300, this
is implemented in entity analyzer 355.
<br/><br/> Document classification/categorization is a general problem in information science.  The task is to assign an electronic document to one or more categories, based on its contents.  Document classification tasks can be divided into two sorts:
supervised document classification where some external mechanism (such as human feedback) provides information on the correct classification for documents, and unsupervised document classification, where the classification must be done entirely without
reference to external information.  There is also a semi-supervised document classification, where parts of the documents are labeled by the external mechanism.  In one embodiment, the system is supervised and semi-supervised where content is tagged by
both internal content voting, external input from users and existing reference tagged corpus for named entity recognition.
<br/><br/> One example of a local entity weighting model may be a vector space model (or term vector model), which is an algebraic model for representing text documents (and any objects, in general) as vectors of identifiers, such as, for example, index
terms.  It is used in information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings.  In this case, documents (dj) and queries (q) are represented as vectors with entity weights (w1 .  . . t).  dj=(w1, j, w2, j, .  . . , wt, j) q=(w1, q,
w2, q, .  . . , wt, q)
<br/><br/> Each vector corresponds to a separate term.  If a term occurs in the document, its value in the vector is non-zero.  The entity weights are established through TFIDF weighting.  In one example, the system defines local entities as people, places
and things found in local content using named entity recognition.
<br/><br/> Vectorization can enable the system to highly compress and index the entire history of all content seen in (or associated) with a place by representing the history of content as a single large vector.  This vector is updated as new content is
discovered for or associated with a place and as product management selectively classifies sample documents by pre-defined classification.
<br/><br/> Each document that the system processes is mapped to a corresponding document vector by computing the CRC (cyclical redundancy check), one example of which is illustrated in FIG. 6.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 6, the CRC computation resembles a polynomial long division operation in which the quotient is discarded and the remainder becomes the result, with the important distinction that the polynomial coefficients are calculated
according to the carry-less arithmetic of a finite field.  A CRC for a given string of characters has a high probability for being unique within a given sequence of bits.  Using the CRC allows the system to create a hash that is unique for each term and
map that hash into the term vector.  The goal of using the hash is to insure that term vectors are both unique and highly orthogonal.  An example vectorization algorithm is as follows: .SIGMA..sub.vec term vectors in a document: .A-inverted.(.tau.):
.tau.  is a people, place, thing term in a document let term crc=CRC(.tau.) from above let term vector=crc=&gt;unique term vector
<br/><br/> These term vectors can then be plugged into a content history algorithm for a given document class to find the vector sum of all document vectors seen in that place:
<br/><br/> .A-inverted.(class): class is content category
<br/><br/> .SIGMA..sub.vec,class: term vectors for a place
<br/><br/> .A-inverted.(.tau.): .tau.  is a people, place, thing term in a document
<br/><br/> let term crc=CRC(.tau.) let term vector=crc=&gt;term vector
<br/><br/> To compute whether a document is similar to documents of a given class of documents within a place, the system computes the cosine similarity between a document and that given class.
<br/><br/> .function..times..times..times..times.  ##EQU00002##
<br/><br/> Those documents with higher cosine similarities computed against a place's term history are mathematically more relevant to that place than those documents with lower scores within document classes.
<br/><br/> In addition to the vectorization approach described above, other types of local entity weighting models may also be used.
<br/><br/> Now that the system has local content corpora (each representing a body of content that is local to a place), the system uses an indexing engine to build and index all the local content.  One example indexing engine is Elastic Search, a
distributed open source search server that supports the near real-time search of Apache Lucene.  Elastic Search can index data using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) over HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP).
<br/><br/> JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.  Provide an index name, a
type and an identifier of a typed JSON document to Elastic Search and it will automatically perform indexing using a unique identifier at the type level and return the actual JSON document used to index the specific data.  Each index in index database
340 can have its own settings which can override the master settings.  One index can be configured with a particular memory storage and have multiple (1 .  . . n) shards with 1 replica each, and another index can have a file based storage with 1 shard
and multiple replicas.  All the index level settings can be controlled when creating an index using a JSON format.
<br/><br/> Other suitable distributed search and index platforms may also be used, for example, Apache Solr, which is an open source enterprise search platform from the Apache Lucene project.  The system therefore can leverage features of Apache Lucene
which include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling.  Both Elastic Search and Solr architectures enable "wide-scaling" of the indexing system to
support virtually unlimited content queries.  As illustrated in FIG. 7, system 700 can deploy an instance of indexing engine 710 that is shared across the entire system architecture.
<br/><br/> These indexing engines enable the system to implement a customized neighborhood content ranking algorithm that determines the relevancy of documents contained in the index relative to a geo place.
<br/><br/> To reflect use bias to most local content, the system may implement a rank-boosting algorithm based on content geotagging.  Only a small percentage (e.g., .about.5%) of content found on the Internet is "hard tagged" with an originating location
encoded as latitude and longitude using the standard geo microformats.  Due to the low occurrence of hard geotagging, local boosting is a function of both local relevancy score by document classification and geotag data when available.  This allows
content to be soft geotagged by using the local entity weighting classifier when no geotag is available for the content.
<br/><br/> The boosting algorithm can be integrated into the indexing engine by implementing a custom ranking query, one example of which is as follows:
<br/><br/> P=probability that a story is in a given place, as determined by local entity weighting, where
<br/><br/> 0&lt;=P&lt;=1
<br/><br/> S=specificity of the place (low for large areas, high for small areas) where
<br/><br/> 0&lt;=S&lt;=1
<br/><br/> Thus, 0&lt;=SP&lt;=1 and SP gives us a measure of how likely it is that the story is locally relevant.
<br/><br/> The bigger SP is, the more locally relevant the story is likely to be.  The ranking function must work with hard geotagged data when soft geotagged data is not present.  This gives the soft geotagged data equal footing with the hard geocoding,
which is useful since all pages will have soft geotagged data while only a small percent will have hard geotagged data.
<br/><br/> If there is no hard geotagged data, let L=0.25 (arbitrary).  Otherwise, use previously calculated value of L: L=L^[2*(1-SP)]
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 depicts an example plot diagram showing values of S and P on the x- and y-axes and values of L on the z-axis.  This is for items with no hard geotagged data (so L starts with the base value of 0.1).  It can be seen that the system only
gets a high value for L if both P and S are high (that is, if the story has a high probability of being in a small region containing the user's neighborhood).  If SP&lt;0.5 then L is raised to a power greater than 1 which makes its value smaller.  This
way, if SP&gt;0.5, it boosts the locality, if SP&lt;0.5, it makes the locality smaller, and if SP=0.5 then the locality is unchanged.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 shows the distance as compared to the product of S and P for data with both hard and soft geocoding.  The z-axis is the value of locality L.
<br/><br/> The effect of applying this exponential boosting is creating shelves of very local data around places, making content very near to the user boosted with higher relevancy and data from external neighborhoods to be driven down the rank,
effectively being excluded or filtered from the results.  This allows strict partitioning of local data along the place hierarchy.  A key aspect of geo places ranking is to rank content based on both Euclidian distance and whether the content is pinned
inside a place boundary.
<br/><br/> A namespace may be utilized to represent a place boundary.  A namespace is an abstract container or environment created to hold a logical grouping of unique identifiers or symbols (i.e., names).  Neighborhood names can have a crowded namespace
due to their frequent re-use from locality to locality.  This neighborhood name collision, when ranking content can be addressed by negating search results using a custom query capability (configured for a suitable indexing engine of choice such as
Elastic Search or Solr).  Search results from the content index are negated when references to outside localities are encountered in the content.
<br/><br/> As an example, Hyde Park refers to a place in Chicago, England, and Austin, Tex.  The local content index allows search results to be filtered by applying Boolean negation to additional place references within the contents body.  By combining
geodatabase information and the content index, searches can be easily pruned for less relevant content by applying stop words (search filters) implicitly for queries within a locality.
<br/><br/> A sample custom search query from the system to an Elastic Search indexing engine is as follows:
<br/><br/> http://search.loku.com/news?type=feed-item%2Cdeal%2Cevent%2Cvideo%2Cbusin- ess&amp;take=20%2C5%2C5%2C 3%2C5&amp;broaden&amp;geo=30.4212235%2C-97.99917959999999%2C30.1128403%2C-97.4869-

<br/><br/> Output from the indexing engine in response to this sample search query is provided in Appendix A attached to this application.
<br/><br/> With a content index in place and an initial base line of local entity weights by place, the system can enable targeted web crawling for additional local content.  This can be done at a stage that is separate or in conjunction with other stages
(also referred to as post-indexing stages).  As illustrated in FIGS. 2, 3, and 10, a crawler (e.g., content acquisition 330) may be configured to continuously acquire content from Internet content sources 310 at stage 1020.  The system may process the
acquired content as described above and fine tune local content corpus 1010.  Index 340 can be updated to include additional content with local relevancy with respect to local content corpus 1010.  As will be described further below, the system may also
conduct supervised and/or semi-supervised content curation for local content corpus 1010 at stage 1030 and self-edit content in local content corpus 1010 at stage 1040.
<br/><br/> To enable the ongoing content polling at stage 1020, in one embodiment, the system utilizes an open source crawler such as Nutch.  FIG. 11 depicts a diagrammatic representation of an example Nutch architecture.  In one embodiment, crawler 1100
can provide the underlying system platform with the following capabilities: Highly scalable and relatively feature rich crawler.  Features like politeness which obeys robots.txt rules.  Robust and scalable--the system can run this crawler on a cluster of
100 machines.  Quality as the system can bias the crawling to fetch "important" pages first.
<br/><br/> The crawler can enable the system to crawl links from local content and keyword search and score newly discovered content through local entity weighting and other customized criteria as links are crawled.  This creates a targeted optimized
web-crawler for every place in the system.  This web crawler uses a place's "local taste" encoded in the place's entity weights to find content that place would likely find interesting.
<br/><br/> As discussed above, the crawler can also monitor content sources on an ongoing basis to determine if there are any updates, which enables large volumes of websites to be watched on a frequent basis.  Once the system finds a "good" local source
of content for a place, that local source will be continuously monitored for updates and those updates are placed into the local content index (e.g., index 340), stored in the indexing engine.  The crawler's continuous monitoring allows a set of
frequently updated content streams to be created from a set of low frequency, infrequently published sources.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 12, once content is acquired and indexed, product management or team of authorized users (collectively, curator 1201) can selectively categorize content based on target content categories, utilizing voting application
1295.  These categorization votes (category decisions 1225) can be stored in databases 350, 1270 and factored in a post-processing process (not shown).  Curator 1201 can vote on a current place's publication and the top of local content index 340 for a
given place.
<br/><br/> As an example, classifications may include neighborly (content reflecting `local flavor`), spam, sports, crime and other interest related categories.  Curator 1201 can add and remove categories based on editorial judgment.  These classifications
can be arbitrary and can be combined with one another through logical composition.
<br/><br/> Votes can associate entity weights with a particular classification and update existing entity weights that are used to automatically classify new documents.
<br/><br/> Further, category classification votes can be augmented based on user clicks to update the weights of each of the categories.  For example and also referring to FIG. 3, if a user clicks through a categorized content item (via any one of
categorized document streams 1205) based on category and does not page-bounce from that item, this viewing (content voting 395) can ascribe a weighted acceptance of a content's categorization.  This value (content classification data 1215) is weighted
due to the uncertainty in the information the viewing ascribes.  Votes, views, and "likes" may be stored in database 390 accessible by the indexing engine described above.
<br/><br/> Over time, as the system runs and more clicks and more votes are collected the categories and entity weight histories capture the place relative categorization.  These categories are place-relative due to the fact the entity weights vary from
place-to-place and reflect a place's tendency to contain local entities.  With these entity weights in place, any content can be scored for "place affinity" for any place in the system.
<br/><br/> Using with the local content index and automated content categorization based on local entity weighting, an automated editing process can be created.  FIG. 13 depicts a diagrammatic representation of an example of a supervised learning process
which draws from content in the index based on editing targets and optimizing based on "best available" content and content mixes.  As an example and also referring to FIG. 3, automated editing function or editor 360 may operate to review a curated piece
of content (step 1310), perhaps with place ranking data 345, and determine whether that content is local to a certain place (step 1320).  If so, the system may add to the local weight of entities in the curated content (step 1330).  If not, the system
may subtract from the weights of entities found in the curated document (step 1340).  Database 1270 is then updated to reflect any adjustment made to the local weighted entities (step 1350).
<br/><br/> Content mixes can enable editing targets to reflect available content.  This can be useful with respect to density in various places.  For example, urban centers often have a high amount of social content like Twitter and there are large numbers
of places of interest, which anchor content streams.  By contrast, suburban communities have sparser content streams driven by occasional posts from fixed content sources.  An optimization goal for the automated editor is to drive regular updates to each
content stream as available content allows.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, an automated editing process pulls from the content index and applies a customized collection algorithm based on content mix type.  The collection algorithm pulls from the index creating a rotation of content based on
geographic and content categories.  An example editing algorithm is provided below: Set the editing target of 10 articles, with a mix of interest types not over representing a content source within the stream.  Let filled(publication): {true, false}
where true when meeting content targets, by category, source attenuation, content type adjacency and length of overall publication .A-inverted.(.rho.): .rho.  is a place group {.rho..epsilon.place groups with active users} while not filled(publication)
.A-inverted.(level): {l.epsilon.{neighborhood(p), macro(p), city(p)}} pull from local content index (level(p)) apply editing targets, trimming (publication), push onto discard-queue re-check editing targets pulling from local content parent(level(p))
<br/><br/> The editing algorithm climbs the place hierarchy to meet content targets.  This allows the system to optimize for the most local relevant content available by each of the content categories.  Other suitable editing algorithms may also be
implemented.
<br/><br/> The system's knowledge increases with each pass of process 1300, strengthening the system's ability to dynamically rank local content that is highly relevant to a particular place and/or local favor.  Each place added in the geodatabase may also
increase the system's ability to further distinguish local entities.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 depicts a diagrammatic representation of an example user interface (UI) of a network site implementing an embodiment of the system disclosed herein.  FIG. 15 a diagrammatic representation of a network communication between a user device
and the network site, the system providing a user through the network site local content highly relevant to a place and/or subject of interest to the user.  Referring to FIGS. 3, 14, and 15, UI 1400 may provide user 1501 with access to network site 380. 
In response to a request about a particular place, system 300 may form a query to index 340.  In the example of FIG. 15, request 1502 is sent from a client device connected to system 300 which may have one or more server machines.
<br/><br/> As a specific example, in causing request 1502 to be sent, user 1501 may not need to proactively do anything other than opening an application.  If user 1501 is using a mobile device, this may be as simple as opening a mobile app. The mobile app
knows the location through internal GPS and time.  The mobile app may comprise client software of system 300, the client software capable of forming a query to search index 340 that essentially asks: "What is the most local place to eat or piece of news
content at this time and place." An example input (in JSON) to the search index is as follows:
<br/><br/> {document:&lt;body text&gt;//extracted to include only the body of article pins: [{lat,lng}, {lat,lng}, {lat,lng} .  . . ]//All geolocated references in document dates: [date1, date2, date3 .  . . ]//All dates extracted though date parsing
process entities: [ner1, ner2, ner3 .  . . ]}//All extracted NER from corenlp}
<br/><br/> As this example illustrates, the input may include features extracted by the system.
<br/><br/> In response, system 300 returns at least one stream 1504 of "most relevant" news articles and places to go at that time.  Stream 1504 may be presented to the user in various ways.  As a specific example, suppose the user is in the Bay Area,
opening an app implementing an embodiment disclosed herein may cause a client device running the app to display stream 1504 as a "thermal" image or media showing the most relevant (white hot) news articles and places to go in the Bay Area, as illustrated
in FIG. 16.  Local content relevant to the Bay Area may also be presented using a pinned map with each pin representing a geographic feature which can be either a point on the map (a street corner between Bay Street and Columbus Avenue in San Francisco,
Calif.) or a polygon (San Jose, Calif.).  Other ways to present local content relevant to a place may also be possible.
