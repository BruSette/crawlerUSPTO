       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A system and method are disclosed for controlling metadata associated
     with content on an electronic device that includes displaying interface
     screens for user entry of metadata control instructions, accepting user
     instructions, modifying metadata of applicable content, and associating
     the modified metadata with the applicable content. The system can export
     and/or store the applicable content along with modified metadata. The
     system can automatically modify metadata according to one or more
     profiles. Relevant profiles can be determined based on the export
     mechanism, destination or type of content. The system can add watermarks
     to indicate metadata modification. The system can display metadata for
     user modification. The content can include photos, videos or other
     content. The system can display metadata and geolocation indicators for
     each content item that indicate whether that item has associated metadata
     and geolocation information. The user can selectively modify meradata of
     selected content.

         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>I claim: <br/><br/> 1.  A system for controlling metadata associated with content items as directed by a user of an electronic device, the system comprising: a user interface comprising interface screens
displayed on a display of the electronic device;  an input mechanism on the electronic device, the input mechanism receiving user instructions through the user interface;  a plurality of content items accessible by the electronic device, one or more of
the plurality of content items having metadata associated therewith, the plurality of content items comprising original content items and modified content items;  an overlay component that places a geolocation overlay indicator on each of the plurality
of content items having associated geolocation metadata;  a content selection component that displays one or more of the plurality of content items on the display of the electronic device, and enables selection of one or more of the plurality of
displayed content items;  the content selection component displays the geolocation overlay indicator with each content items having associated geolocation metadata;  a plurality of content sharing mechanisms on the electronic device, each of the
plurality of content sharing mechanisms for at least one of receiving content items and sending content items over a network accessible by the electronic device;  a geotag profile accessible by the electronic device, the geotag profile including profile
instructions regarding geolocation metadata control and being directed to at least one of the plurality of content sharing mechanisms;  a sharing selection component for selecting a selected content item of the plurality of content items, and for
selecting a selected content sharing mechanism of the plurality of content sharing mechanisms, the selected content item having selected content metadata associated therewith;  a metadata modification component for modifying metadata associated with the
plurality of content items including modifying the selected content metadata before sharing the selected content items, the metadata modification component selecting the geotag profile based on the selected content item and the selected content sharing
mechanism, and modifying geolocation metadata of the selected content metadata in accordance with the profile instructions of the geotag profile when the geotag profile is selected;  a sharing component for sharing a sharing version of the selected
content item with a sharing version of the selected content metadata over a network accessible by the electronic device through the selected content sharing mechanism;  wherein metadata associated with the original content items has not been modified by
the metadata modification component and metadata associated with the modified content items has been modified by the metadata modification component, and wherein when the metadata modification component modifies selected content metadata before sharing a
selected content item and the geotag profile is selected, the metadata modification component modifies the selected content metadata associated with the selected content item in accordance with the profile instructions of the geotag profile to generate
the sharing version of the selected content metadata, and the metadata modification component does not modify the selected content metadata associated with the selected content item.
<br/><br/> 2.  The system of claim 1, wherein when the geotag profile is selected, the sharing version of the selected content metadata shared by the sharing component includes geolocation metadata of the selected content metadata modified in accordance
with the profile instructions of the geotag profile;  and when the geotag profile is not selected, the sharing version of the selected content metadata shared by the sharing component includes geolocation metadata of the selected content metadata not
modified in accordance with the profile instructions of the geotag profile.
<br/><br/> 3.  The system of claim 1, wherein when the metadata modification component modifies metadata associated with a particular content item, the metadata modification component generates an electronic copy of the particular content item, and
associates the modified metadata with the electronic copy of the particular content item.
<br/><br/> 4.  The system of claim 1, wherein when the geotag profile is selected, the metadata modification component generates the sharing version of the selected content metadata in accordance with the profile instructions of the geotag profile by
removing the geolocation metadata of the selected content metadata.
<br/><br/> 5.  The system of claim 1, further comprising: a marking component for marking the modified content items with a watermark;  and wherein the content selection component displays the watermark to identify the modified content items.
<br/><br/> 6.  The system of claim 1, wherein the sharing selection component uses the content selection component for selecting the selected content item of the plurality of content items.
<br/><br/> 7.  The system of claim 1, further comprising an add content component for adding additional content items to the plurality of content items accessible by the electronic device.
<br/><br/> 8.  The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of content items and the metadata associated with the plurality of content items are stored in memory of the electronic device.
<br/><br/> 9.  The system of claim 8, further comprising a plurality of profiles stored in memory of the electronic device, the geotag profile being one of the plurality of profiles.
<br/><br/> 10.  The system of claim 1, further comprising a plurality of profiles stored in memory of the electronic device, the geotag profile being one of the plurality of profiles.
<br/><br/> 11.  The system of claim 1, wherein when the selected content sharing mechanism is electronic mail, the metadata modification component generates the sharing version of the selected content metadata from the selected content metadata, and when
the geotag profile is selected and the selected content metadata includes geolocation information the metadata modification component removes the geolocation information from the sharing version of the selected content metadata;  and the sharing
component generates an electronic mail message with the sharing version of the selected content item and the sharing version of the selected content metadata for electronic mailing over a network.

<br/><br/> Smart phones are required to support global positioning system (GPS) capability by September of 2012.  Other mobile devices and televisions are required to support GPS capability by 2018.  Many mobile devices, for example mobile phones,
associate metadata with content generated or captured by the mobile device, for example photos.  For a photo taken by a mobile device, this metadata can include GPS data showing the location where the photo was taken, a date showing when the photo was
taken, the name of the owner of the mobile device, and other data such as comments or the names of the people in the photo.  Typically this associated metadata stays with the photo and can be retrieved by recipients/viewers of the photo, including
unintended recipients/viewers of the photo.  Users have limited control of this metadata, especially after the content is sent to other users or shared through social networking, photo sharing or other Internet sites.
<br/><br/> Privacy issues due to metadata associated with on-line content is a growing concern.  Electronic device makers and service providers, and many Internet sites provide varying capabilities to users to control metadata.  Many electronic devices
record and save metadata associated with content generated or stored on the device.  Some device makers and service providers allow a user to view all or part of this stored metadata, while others do not even allow the user to view the associated
metadata.  Some device makers and service providers allow limited editing of this stored metadata, for example associating a name or other comment with content on the device.  Social networking and photo sharing sites have different rules regarding
metadata associated with uploaded or generated content.  These sites maintain the metadata associated with content, some of these sites allow users to show metadata associated with content, and some allow users to edit some of the metadata associated
with content.
<br/><br/> The present system and method can be used to manage, control and organize metadata associated with content on various types of electronic devices.  These electronic devices can include but are not limited to mobile devices, smart phones, digital
cameras, computers, and consumer electronic devices.  The system can be part of the device operating system software, a stand-alone application, or part of an integrated component embedded in a GPS-capable device, a camera, a baseband or a system-on-chip
(SoC).  The system can be used with various types of content including but not limited to digital images and digital videos.  Many devices do not allow users to control personal information which is recorded as metadata and stored in content.  GPS data,
also known as geolocation data or a geotag, dates and name tags are examples of this metadata.  Current image capture devices, like mobile phones and digital cameras allow users to turn off geotagging/GPS for their cameras but this method is not ideal
for users who want to keep this metadata in their original photos but not include it when sharing their photos on the internet, text or email.  The present system enables users to have control over this metadata which is recorded and associated with
digital content, so they can remove personal information before sharing them on social networks, email, text and the internet, but let them keep this metadata in their personal copies of the content.
<br/><br/> A method is disclosed for controlling metadata associated with content on an electronic device.  The method includes displaying interface screens on a display of the electronic device for user entry of instructions regarding metadata control,
accepting user instructions regarding metadata control through an input mechanism, modifying metadata of applicable content in accordance with the user instructions, and associating the modified metadata with the applicable content.  Associating the
modified metadata with the applicable content can include making an electronic copy of original content, associating the modified metadata with the electronic copy, the electronic copy being the applicable content, and not modifying the metadata

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The embodiments of the present invention described below are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed in the following detailed description.  Rather, the embodiments are chosen and described so that
others skilled in the art may appreciate and understand the principles and practices of the present invention.
<br/><br/> The present system can be used to manage, control and/or organize metadata associated with content on various types of electronic devices.  These electronic devices can include but are not limited to mobile devices, smart phones, digital
cameras, computers (including pad, laptop and desktop computers running various operating systems), and consumer electronic devices.  The system can be embedded as part of the device operating system, a stand-alone application, or in an integrated
circuit (IC) chip that is part of a GPS-capable device, a camera, a baseband or a system-on-chip (SoC).  The system can be used with various types of content including but not limited to digital images and digital video in compressed or uncompressed
formats.
<br/><br/> Many devices do not allow users to control personal information which is recorded as metadata and stored in content, for example photos.  GPS data, also known as geolocation data or a geotag, dates and name tags are examples of this metadata. 
Current image capture devices, like mobile phones and digital cameras allow users to turn off geotagging/GPS for their cameras but this method is not ideal for users who want to keep this metadata in their original photos but not include it when sharing
their photos on the internet, text or email.  The present system enables users to have control over this metadata which is recorded and associated with digital content, so they can remove or modify personal information before sharing the content on
social networks, email, text and the internet, but let them keep this metadata in their personal copies of the content.
<br/><br/> The system can provide the capability to perform some or all of the following functions on various types of electronic devices.  The system can enable metadata removal, editing and viewing with the purpose of sharing or exporting content with
which the metadata is associated, for example through social networks, email, text, blogs, photo websites and etail (eBay, Craigslist, etc).  The system can enable watermarking via an overlay on the content, or a mark on a bottom corner or other location
of the content, for example a photo.  The watermark can signify that the metadata associated with the content has been removed/edited.  The system can save content to a designated folder or overwrite the original content for export to other applications. The system can be set to remove all metadata on sharing of content which will allow users to automatically remove metadata when sharing content on-line, for example photos/videos.  The system can be an embedded feature for a smartphone OS (for example,
Apple iOS, Google Android, Microsoft Win7, Java, Blackberry, Symbian, etc.).  The system can be an embedded application in chip components (ICs) for integrating into consumer electronics devices as embedded controls (for example, digital cameras, hard
drives, connected consumer electronics devices, smart TVs, etc.)
<br/><br/> Exemplary embodiments of the system implementing some of the above functionality are described below.  These embodiments are directed to a smart phone implementation, but cam also be implemented on computers or other electronic devices.  The
content discussed with these embodiments is generally photos, but other types of content having associated metadata can be managed by the system.  Exemplary user interface screens for these exemplary embodiments are shown and the associated functionality
is described.  The system can be used by various types of users including mothers with children, photographers, people that use singles sites and social networking sites, and people that use or provide content to social networking, news (eye on), or
blogger sites, etc. The system can be used for photos, videos and other content that is captured or stored by the electronic device, or content received from other devices or persons and forwarded.  The system can be used to view, edit and/or add
metadata.  The system can also be used to prepare content by removing or editing metadata before exporting, emailing or uploading to another user, or to a website.
<br/><br/> The system can overwrite original content or create a folder for edited content, content with the metadata removed or edited as desired by the user.  The system can include free-versions and paid-versions.  A free-version can enable a limited
number of photos to be processed, and then periodically ask the user, through pop-up windows or other methods, to upgrade based on a timer or the number of photos processed by the system.  The free version can disable some of the user-controlled
features, for example content watermarking A paid version can unlock more or all features and allow the user to have more control over the system settings.  The system can store anonymous usage data in a server database.  This usage data can include
number of application downloads, number of application starts, amount of time the application is open, number of application failures, number of photos added, number of photos processed, amount of hidden data removed, amount of GPS data removed, number
of thumbnails removed, number of dates removed, number of titles changed, number of times taken by data is changed, number of photos shared through email, number of photos shared through various social networking and photo sharing sites (for example,
<b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Flickr, Twitter, Picasa, Photobucket, WordPress etc.), or other data of interest.  This usage data can be sent to a metrics database created on a system server when an internet connection is detected, and otherwise stored locally until an
internet connection is detected.  Data reporting frequency can be set to a certain time period or usage amount or other parameter and can be changed through the system server or otherwise.

Cancel button 944.  No actual changes are made to the metadata for the photos selected on the modify photo interface 800 until the OK button 942 is selected.  When the OK button 942 is selected then the metadata for the selected photos is modified as
determined by the fields and checkboxes in the metadata selection section 902.  A confirmation window can appear indicating that the metadata was successfully modified for the selected photos, and then the user can be returned to the modify photo
interface 800 with system icons 844 added to the photos that were modified.  When the Cancel button 944 is selected then the metadata for the selected photos is not modified and the user is returned to the modify photo interface 800.
<br/><br/> The user can enter a filename in the Filename field 920 to be associated with all of the photos selected in the photo section 804 of the modify photo interface 800.  If only one photo is selected then that photo receives the name entered in the
Filename field 920.  If multiple photos are selected then a numerical suffix can be added to the filenames for each of the photos, for example Vacation_001, Vacation_002, etc. If the Filename field 920 is left blank, then no change is made to the
filename in the metadata.  The user can enter an author name in the Author field 922 to be associated with all of the photos selected in the photo section 804 of the modify photo interface 800.  If on the settings screen 600, the Include Author checkbox
602 is checked and an author name was entered in the Taken By field 604, then that author name can appear in the Author field 922.  If the remove date/time checkbox 924 is checked then the date/time fields are blanked out in the metadata for the selected
photos, otherwise no change is made to the date/time in the metadata.  If the remove location checkbox 926 is checked then the location and GPS fields are blanked out in the metadata for the selected photos, otherwise no change is made to the location
and GPS fields in the metadata.  If the remove all checkbox 928 is checked then all of the fields are blanked out in the metadata for the selected photos, otherwise no additional fields are changed in the metadata.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 shows an exemplary photo sharing or export interface 1000 that includes a parameter bar 1002, a photo section 1004 and a command bar 1008.  A free version of the system can also include an advertisement section.  The parameter bar 1002
includes one or more parameters of potential interest to the user, for example the number of photos currently selected for sharing or export.  The photo section 1004 includes photos that are currently managed by the system.  The command bar 1008 includes
icons for one or more commands that can be selected by the user.
<br/><br/> In this embodiment, the photo section 1004 shows an array of cells 1040 where each cell 1040 contains a thumbnail of a photo managed by the system or photos in the currently selected photo album.  The photos can be organized and displayed in
various other arrangements as would be obvious to those of skill in the art.  A check box 1042 in a cell 1040 indicates that the user has selected the photo in that cell 1040 for modification.  A system icon 1044 in a cell 1040 indicates that the photo
in that cell 1040 has already been modified by the system.  The system icon 1044 can indicate photos that have been modified in the current session, or can indicate photos that have been modified by the system whether in the current or prior sessions. 
In this embodiment, the command bar 1008 provides a share icon 1082, an all icon 1084 and a remove icon 1086.
<br/><br/> The user can select individual photos for sharing by selecting individual cells 1040, indicated by the check boxes 1042.  Alternatively, the user can select the all icon 1084 to select all of the photos in the photo section 1004.  If all of the
photos in the photo section 1004 are currently selected, then selecting the all icon 1084 can deselect all of the photos in the photo section 1004.  The share icon 1082 can bring up a sharing selection interface 1100 to select the methods for sharing the
photos selected in the photo section 1004.  The remove icon 1086 can remove the photos that are selected in the photo section 1004 as indicated by the check boxes 1042 in the cells 1040 so that those photos are no longer subject to sharing in this
session of the photo sharing interface 1000.  A confirm window can be brought up when the remove photo icon 1086 is selected asking for the user to select "yes" or "cancel" before actually removing the selected photos.  If the user selects "yes" then the
photos are removed and the user is returned to the photo sharing interface 1000, and if the user selects "cancel" then the photos are not removed and the user is returned to the photo sharing interface 1000.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 shows an exemplary sharing selection interface 1100 for user selection of methods for sharing selected photos.  The sharing selection interface 1100 can be reached in various ways including by selecting the share icon 284 of the active
system entry interface 200, selecting the share icon 514 of the command menu 510, or selecting the share icon 1082 of the photo sharing interface 1000.  Selecting the back device control 216 can return the user from the sharing selection interface 1100
to the photo sharing interface 1000.  The sharing selection interface 1100 includes options for the user to select in sharing selected photos.  In this embodiment, the options include electronic mail (Email) option 1102, multimedia messaging service
(MMS) option 1104, various social networking and photo sharing website options 1106 (<b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Flickr, Twitter, Picasa, Photobucket, etc.) and other options 1108 where the user can enter additional social networking and photo sharing websites.  The
options listed in the sharing selection interface 1100 can be tailored for a particular device so that unavailable options are not listed.  The user can be prompted to select photo file size before sharing, for example small, medium or large.
<br/><br/> If the user selects the Email option 1102, then the system can open the appropriate electronic mail client on the device, attach the photos and allow the user to enter the e-mail addresses of the intended recipients.  If the user selects the MMS
option 1104, then the system can open the appropriate messaging client on the device, attach the photos and allow the user to enter the phone numbers of the intended recipients.  When sending photos using the MMS option 1104, the system can automatically
reduce the photos to small file size.  If the user selects one of the various social networking, photo sharing or other website options 1106, 1108, then the system can open an Internet browser on the device accessing the user's home page on the selected
site and upload the selected photos.  The system can include user selectable default profiles to be applied to content based on the method selected for exporting/sharing of the content.  After exporting/sending/uploading the selected photos using the
selected sharing options, the user can be returned to the sharing selection interface 1100.  Alternatively, if the device or photo sharing client exits the user from the system, then when the user returns to the system, the system can return to the photo
sharing interface 1000 with the same photos selected for sharing.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 shows an exemplary camera interface 1200 for taking photos.  The camera interface 1200 can be reached in various ways including by selecting the camera icon 286 of the active system entry interface 200, or selecting the camera icon 330
of the add photos interface 300.  The camera interface 1200 includes a photo preview area 1202, a pull-down controls menu 1204, a zoom function 1206 and a system return button 1208.  When the camera takes a photo, it can record exchangeable image file
format (EXIF) metadata including location (GPS) data and store with the photos by default.  The photo preview area 1202 can show what the device sees in the lens before taking a photo.  The pull-down controls menu 1204 can pull down controls for the
camera, for example exposure, brightness, effects, settings, etc. The zoom function 1206 can zoom in and out on the subject and this can be shown by the change in the photo preview area 1202.  The system return button 1208 or the device back control 216
can return the user to the system interface screen where the camera was activated adding the captured photo or photos taken while in the camera interface 1200.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 13-15 show another exemplary embodiment of a system and method for controlling and organizing metadata that includes many of the features described above.  The system can be designed to integrate within the device operating system
settings, content viewer, web browser or stand-alone application for automatically or manually editing metadata in content that is to be shared from the device.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 shows a content selection screen 1300 with options for recording new image and video content.  The content selection screen 1300 includes an array of one or more types of content items including image content items 1302, video content
items 1304 and other types of content items 1306 which can include textual or other types of content.  The content items can be selected individually or as a batch.  New image content can be created and added to the system by selecting the camera icon
1310 and new video content can be created and added to the system by selecting the video icon 1312.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 shows an individual content item 1400 with selectable overlay indicators 1410, 1420 showing when metadata information is contained or associated with the content item.  The first overlay indicator 1410 can indicate whether the content
item 1400 includes metadata information.  The metadata information can include, for example, Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF), International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) and/or Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) format metadata
information.  The second overlay indicator 1420 can indicate whether geolocation metadata is associated with the content item 1400.  By selecting the overlay indicators 1410, 1420 when they indicate that metadata information is associated with the
content item 1400, the metadata information of various formats can be displayed for viewing and/or modification by the user.  Selecting the second overlay indicator 1420 when it indicates geolocation metadata is associated with the content item 1400 can
display a map showing the location indicated by the metadata with street address, latitude/longitude/altitude or other geolocation information.  When the metadata is displayed by selecting the overlay indicators 1410, 1420, the system can enable the user
to modify fields of the displayed metadata.
<br/><br/> Before sharing/exporting selected content, the user can elect to modify or remove the metadata information associated with a content item manually or by using predetermined profiles or both.  Manual modification of the metadata information for
an individual content item 1400 can be done when the metadata information is displayed for that content item using the overlay indicators 1410, 1420.  Users can also create any number of customized profiles for metadata modification.  These customized
metadata profiles can include, for example, a custom location for all shared content, preset taken by information, comments, website address, copyright and other metadata information available in EXIF, IPTC, XMP or other metadata fields.  The
geolocation, directional and altitude data can also be modified or added manually or by using customized profiles.
<br/><br/> FIG. 15 illustrates an individual content item 1500 and its associated metadata.  In this example, the content item 1500 has associated geolocation metadata 1510, associated EXIF format metadata 1520, associated IPTC format metadata 1530 and
associated XMP format metadata 1540.  The latitude and longitude data can be modified or added by manipulating a pin 1512 to a specific location on a map and/or by entering a specific street address 1514.  The altitude and other geolocation information
can also be modified or deleted.  Specific EXIF metadata fields 1522 can be modified or deleted, or a complete removal option 1524 can be selected to remove all metadata in all fields of the EXIF file 1520 and/or to delete the entire EXIF file 1520. 
Specific IPTC metadata fields 1532 can be modified or deleted, or a complete removal option 1534 can be selected to remove all metadata in all fields of the IPTC file 1530 and/or to delete the entire IPTC file 1530.  Specific XMP metadata fields 1542 can
be modified or deleted, or a complete removal option 1544 can be selected to remove all metadata in all fields of the XMP file 1540 and/or to delete the entire XMP file 1540.  A visual watermark 1502 can be added to the content item 1500 indicating that
associated metadata information has been modified by the system.  The visual watermark 1502 can be an option controllable by the user, and the user can be enabled to customize graphic or text to be used as the watermark 1502.
<br/><br/> When selected content items are shared/exported, if no modification profile has been selected then the content will be shared with no further metadata modification.  A profile can be created to modify specific metadata fields automatically or
manually.
<br/><br/> A default profile can be selected or created for the system to remove or modify all, or specific metadata fields associated with content items before they are shared.  For example, a standard profile for removing all metadata for any shared
content can be the default profile option.  Other standard profile options can include, but are not limited to, removing geolocation data, removing date and time data, adding or overwriting taken by data and/or adding copyright data.  An unlimited number
of profiles can be created or selected by the user to be automatically applied to any content that is shared from the device or application, and different profiles can be used for different types of content or in different situations.  In other words,
once an automatic profile has been selected, it can be applied to all content as it is shared, unless the profile has been set to show a decision prompt when content is shared.
<br/><br/> A common use for modifying or adding geolocation metadata as an automatic profile is for sharing artwork and photography on photo sharing and social network sites and automatically providing business address information.  Automatic profiles can
be created for EXIF, IPTC, XMP or other format metadata that include automatically modifying and removing specific metadata fields, or deleting the entire metadata file and its contents.  Geolocation metadata is often stored in EXIF metadata fields, so
use of an automatic profile to remove all geolocation data from content as it is shared would include deleting any geolocation metadata in an associated EXIF metadata file.  When a profile has been implemented by the system, it will automatically apply
to all content items to which it is associated when that content is selected and/or exported and/or shared from the device.  For example: text, instant message, email, internet, website, online storage, social network, local storage, file transfer and
other methods for transferring digital content.
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 shows an exemplary profile control flow diagram 1600 for an embodiment of the metadata control and management system.  At block 1602 the user has selected content to be shared or content for metadata modification using an input mechanism
of the system.  At block 1604, the system determines if there is a profile for the particular situation.  If there is an applicable preselected profile for the situation, then at block 1606 a metadata modification component applies the situation profile
to the content and at block 1620 the content is shared, exported and/or saved with the modified metadata.  If there is not an applicable preselected profile for the situation, then control moves to block 1608.
<br/><br/> At block 1608, the metadata modification component determines if there is a profile for the particular content type to be shared.  If there is an applicable preselected profile for the content type, then at block 1610 the metadata modification
component applies the content type profile to the content and at block 1620 the content is shared, exported and/or saved with the modified metadata.  If there is not an applicable preselected profile for the content type, then control moves to block
1612.
<br/><br/> At block 1612, the metadata modification component determines if there is a preselected general default profile to be applied to content before it is shared.  If there is a preselected general default profile, then at block 1614 the metadata
modification component applies the default profile to the content and at block 1620 the content is shared, exported and/or saved with the modified metadata.  If there is not a preselected general default profile, then control moves to block 1616.
<br/><br/> At block 1616, the metadata modification component allows the user to manually modify the metadata associated with the selected content or to select one or more profiles to be used on the content.  At block 1618, the metadata modification
component applies any user selected profiles to the metadata associated with the content.  Then at block 1620 the content is shared, exported and/or saved with the modified or unmodified metadata.
<br/><br/> FIG. 17 illustrates an exemplary environment for use of the metadata control and management system.  A plurality of electronic devices, including a computer 1704 and a smart phone 1702 can communicate with one or more server systems 1720.  Each
of the user devices 1702, 1704 includes input and output mechanisms.  For example, input mechanisms can include keyboard, mouse, touch screen, pointing device, etc.; and output mechanisms can include display screen, printer, etc. The server systems 1720
can be phone system service providers, internet service providers or other types of service providers enabling access to other electronic devices and networks.  The smart phone 1702 stores and creates content 1712 stored in memory, and the computer 1704
stores and creates content 1714 stored in memory.  Some of the content 1712, 1714 can contain or be associated with metadata information.  The devices 1712, 1714 can share content with one another through the server 1720.  The server 1720 can also
communicate with wide area networks 1730, such as the internet.  Other servers, such as the server 1740 can also communicate with the wide area network 1730 and with a local device 1750.  The devices 1702, 1704 and 1750 can share content through the wide
area network 1730.  The metadata control and management system can be used to control the metadata that accompanies the content shared between these devices.  This is only one exemplary environment, and this metadata system can be used in numerous
environments known by those of skill in the art.
