<br/><br/> New methods and systems for storing personal media content, such as personal images and videos, are being developed.  For example, many different third party services provide users with access to local or online services or repositories for
storing personal information.  Therefore, users can store personal media content on a variety of different local or online repositories simultaneously.  However, such repositories often utilize different systems for user identification.  In many
circumstances, this may make it difficult for users to easily access and utilize their personal media content, since the media content may be spread out across multiple repositories with multiple different corresponding usernames and passwords. 
Moreover, a vast number of online repositories provide users with access to a multitude of media content.  However, locating specific media content that is spread out across multiple online repositories make become burdensome for the user in the absence
of a centralized method for accessing such repositories.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Embodiments disclosed herein set forth a method and system for inserting media content into a document, presentation, or Website, or any combinations thereof, from any of a number of repositories.  The media content may include, for example,
photos, videos, or audio content.  The repositories may include local repositories that may be located within a user device or online repositories that may be accessed by the user device through a network, or any combinations thereof.  Moreover, the
repositories may be powered by third party services.  As an example, the current method and system may be used to insert a user's personal image from a social media repository into a local document on the user's computer.
<br/><br/> The method and system disclosed herein may be implemented through the use of a user interface, wherein the user interface may be provided to the user device by a repository management service.  A user of the user device may authorize the
repository management service to access any of a number of personal repositories.  Then, the user may obtain and insert personal media content into a location without logging in to any of the individual repositories.  Instead, the user may log in to the
repository management service through a particular program or application located within the user device, and the repository management service may utilize tokens to access the desired repositories.  This may reduce the burden on the user by allowing the
user to select and insert desired media content from various local or online repositories through one user interface, instead of obtaining the desired media content by logging in to every repository separately.
<br/><br/> As a preliminary matter, some of the figures describe concepts in the context of one or more structural components, variously referred to as functionality, modules, features, elements, etc. The various components shown in the figures can be
implemented in any manner, for example, by software, hardware (e.g., discreet logic components, etc.), firmware, and so on, or any combination of these implementations.  In one embodiment, the various components may reflect the use of corresponding
components in an actual implementation.  In other embodiments, any single component illustrated in the figures may be implemented by a number of actual components.  The depiction of any two or more separate components in the figures may reflect different
functions performed by a single actual component.  FIG. 1 provides details regarding one system that may be used to implement the functions shown in the figures.
<br/><br/> Other figures describe the concepts in flowchart form.  In this form, certain operations are described as constituting distinct blocks performed in a certain order.  Such implementations are exemplary and non-limiting.  Certain blocks described
herein can be grouped together and performed in a single operation, certain blocks can be broken apart into plural component blocks, and certain blocks can be performed in an order that differs from that which is illustrated herein, including a parallel
manner of performing the blocks.  The blocks shown in the flowcharts can be implemented by software, hardware, firmware, manual processing, and the like, or any combination of these implementations.  As used herein, hardware may include computer systems,
discreet logic components, such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and the like, as well as any combinations thereof.

<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is an embodiment of a system 200 for media content insertion from multiple local or online repositories.  The system 200 may include a user device 202, a repository management service 204, and third party services 206, among others.  In
some embodiments, the user device 202 may be included within a client platform (not shown).  The client platform may include any number of centralized servers connected to multiple user devices, as well as any number of databases for storing digital
media content or other information.  The user device 202 may include any type of computing device which is capable of storing or displaying digital media content, such as a mobile device, laptop computer, desktop computer, gaming device, or television,
among others.  Moreover, the repository management service 204 and the third party services 206 may include any number of servers or other computing devices, wherein the servers may include, for example, cloud servers or Web servers.
<br/><br/> The user device 202, the repository management service 204, and the third party services 206 may be coupled to each other through a network (not shown).  The network may include any type of network or combination of networks that provide access
to the servers or other computing devices included within the system 200.  In some embodiments, for example, the network may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless wide area network (WWAN), or the Internet, among
others.  In addition, the user device 202, the repository management service 204, and the third party services 206 may be colocated and physically coupled to each other.
<br/><br/> The user device 202 may be communicably coupled to the repository management service 204 through a wired or wireless connection, as indicated by the arrow 208.  The user device 202 may also be communicably coupled to the third party services 206
through a wired or wireless connection, as indicated by the arrow 210.  The third party services 206 may be configured to support any of a number of local or online repositories.  The user of the user device 202 may access such repositories through the
third party services 206 by creating a user account for each of the third party services 206 that host a desired repository.  The user may then use the repositories to store personal media content, such as audio files, video files, or image files, or any
combinations thereof.
<br/><br/> The user of the user device 202 may gain access to the repository management service 204 through the creation of a user account for the repository management service 204, or through the entering of log-in information if the user is already
registered with the repository management service 204.  Moreover, the user of the user device 202 may authorize the repository management service 204 to access the media content stored within any number of the repositories hosted by particular third
party services 206.  The authorization may be performed for a particular repository by a user entering personal log-in information or other account information for the third party service 206 hosting the desired repository into a user interface provided
to the user device 202 by the repository management service 204.
<br/><br/> Once the user has entered such personal log-in information for any number of the third party services 206, the repository management service 204 may retrieve tokens from the third party services 206, as indicated by the arrow 212.  The tokens
may be used to provide authorized access to particular repositories hosted by the third party services 206.  When the user device 202 communicates with the repository management service 204, the repository management service 204 may send the tokens to
the user device 202, as indicated by the arrow 208.  The user device 202 may then use the tokens to directly access the third party services 206 via the user interface, as indicated by the arrow 210.  In various embodiments, the user device 202 may
download specific media content from particular local or online repositories via the user interface and insert such media content into a location or file within the user device 202.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a method 300 for media content insertion within a computing environment.  The method begins at block 302 with the displaying of indicia corresponding to a number of repositories within a user interface.  The indicia
may include, for example, links to each of the repositories or displayed media content from each of the repositories.  In various embodiments, the repositories may include specific repositories that have been authorized to interact with the user
interface on behalf of a user of a user device.  The repositories may include a local repository on the user device, as well as an online repository accessed by the user device via a network.  Moreover, the repositories may also include multiple local
repositories or multiple online repositories, or any combinations thereof.  The user interface may be a Web user interface that is provided to the user through the user device by a repository management service.  The user of the user device may gain
access to the repository management service by logging-in to the repository management service using specific account information, such as a username and password.  In various embodiments, the repository management service may provide the user interface
to the user device through a network in response to a user's click on a media content insertion icon displayed on the user device.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, the user of the user device may authorize the repository management service to interact with the repositories by inputting user identification information for each of the repositories via the user interface.  The user
identification information may include, for example, a username and password for a particular third party service that hosts a selected repository.  Moreover, once the user enters the user identification information for a specific repository into the
user interface, the repository management service may gain access to a token relating to the user identification information for the repository.
<br/><br/> The token may specify the access rights of the repository management service with regard to the selected repository.  For example, the token may provide the repository management service with permission to access a user's personal media content
that is stored on the particular repository.  Moreover, the repository management service may use a separate token for authorizing an interaction with each of the repositories.  Furthermore, the tokens for the repositories may be generated using any of a
variety of different authorization techniques, including, for example, an open standard for authorization known as "Open Authorization" (OAuth).  In an embodiment, OAuth may allow for the easy sharing of private resources stored on one Website with
another Website through the use of private, encrypted tokens to authorize the interaction between the two Websites.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, if a selected repository is a local repository, the repository management service may access the repository without authorization by the user.  Such local repositories may include memory or storage locations within the user
device, wherein the memory or storage locations are configured to store the user's personal media content.  Such media content may include any form of audio, video, or imaging content generated or uploaded by the user, as well as any form of audio,
video, or imaging content that is accessible by the user device through any type of external device that is communicably coupled to the user device.  Such external devices may include, for example, digital cameras, mobile phones, tablets, Universal
Serial Bus (USB) devices, or external hard drives, among others.
<br/><br/> At block 304, media content may be obtained from any of the number of repositories at the user interface.  The repositories may be chosen by the user from the number of possible repositories displayed within the user interface.  In various
embodiments, the user of the user device may obtain the media content from a selected repository via the user interface by clicking on a search icon for the selected repository.  The search icon may be a link to a specific authorized location or group of
locations within the selected repository, wherein the specific authorized location or group of locations may include personal media content of the user.  Moreover, each authorized repository may have an associated search icon.  Therefore, specific media
content may be independently chosen and obtained from each selected repository according to the preferences of the user.  Moreover, the user interface may also include icons for any number of unauthorized repositories, wherein the icons may include links
to the third party services that host the particular unauthorized repositories.  In an embodiment, if a user clicks on an icon for an unauthorized repository, the user may be prompted to authorize the repository management service to access the
particular unauthorized repository by entering user identification information for the corresponding third party service.  Thus, the user may continuously add additional repositories to the list of selected repositories from which the repository
management service may obtain media content through the user interface.
<br/><br/> At block 306, the obtained media content may be inserted into a location via the user interface.  The location may include, for example, a document, presentation, or file stored on the user device, as well a Website accessed by the user device
through the network.  The obtained media content may be inserted into the location in response to a user's click on a media content insertion icon within the user interface.  Moreover, in an embodiment, the user interface may divide the obtained media
content into categories based on specific types of media content, and the user interface may include separate pages or tabs for the insertion of each type of media content.  According to this embodiment, the media content insertion icon may be
represented by a video content insertion icon, an audio content insertion icon, or an imaging content insertion icon, or any combinations thereof, based on the specific type of media content that is supported by the currently-opened page or tab of the
user interface.
<br/><br/> The blocks 302, 304, and 306 of the method 300 are intended as exemplary embodiments of the steps of the media content insertion method disclosed herein.  However, the block diagram of the method 300 is not intended to indicate that the steps of
the method 300 are to be executed in any particular order or that all of the steps are to be included in every case.  Furthermore, any number of steps may be added to the method 300 according to the specific application.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is an illustration of an embodiment of a user interface 400 for media content insertion that may be displayed by a user device.  The user interface 400 may be a Web user interface hosted by a repository management service.  The user
interface 400 may be provided to the user device by the repository management service and displayed on a screen of the user device in response to a user's click on a media content insertion icon.  The media content insertion icon may be located within
any of a number of specific programs or applications located within the user device.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the user interface 400 may be displayed within the Microsoft.RTM.  Office program and may be directed to the insertion of image content into a Microsoft.RTM.  Office document 401.  Moreover, the user interface 400 may present
the user of the user device with options of multiple repositories from which images may be selected, including, for example, a local image repository 402 on the user device, a Web-based image repository 404, or a Microsoft.RTM.  Office "Clip Art" image
repository 406.  The user of the user device may then click on a "Browse" icon 408 if the user desires to search for images in the local image repository 402, a "Search Web Images" icon 410 if the user desires to search for images in the Web-based image
repository 404, or a "Search Clip Art" icon 412 if the user desired to search for images in the Microsoft.RTM.  Office Clip Art image repository 406.  In an embodiment, the "Search Web Images" icon 410 and the "Search Clip Art" icon 412 may include
search boxes, and the user may input search criteria into the search boxes in order to directly search for specific images within the corresponding repositories.  Furthermore, if the user desires to authorize the repository management service to access
other online repositories through the user interface, the user may click on a repository management service sign-in icon 414.  In an embodiment, the repository management service sign-in icon 414 may display a message for the user, such as "Sign In and
Connect to Your Personal Services." Once the user clicks on the repository management service sign-in icon 414, the user may sign in to the repository management service using a username and password, or any other suitable form of personal
identification.  The user interface 400 may then be updated to provide the user with additional options for the insertion of media content into the Microsoft.RTM.  Office document, as discussed further with respect to FIG. 5.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is an illustration of an embodiment of a user interface 500 for media content insertion that may be displayed by a user device in response to a log-in to a repository management service by a user.  Like numbered items are as described
with respect to FIG. 4.  The user interface 500 may be generated from the user interface 400 in response to a user's sign-in to the repository management service.  The user interface 500 may display any online repositories that have already been
authorized by the user.  For example, a "User Name's Social Media Account" repository 502 may represent an authorized online repository that is powered by a specific third party service.  The user interface 500 may display images 504 from the "User
Name's Social Media Account" repository 502.  Moreover, if the user desires to view more images from the "User Name's Social Media Account" repository 502, the user may click on a "See More" icon 506 that is associated within the images 504 from the
repository 502.  Once the user clicks on the "See More" icon 506, the user interface 500 may be updated to provide the user with a larger number of displayed images from the "User Name's Social Media Account" repository 502, as discussed further with
respect to FIG. 6.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, the user interface 500 includes an "Add a Service" feature 508 in order to provide the user with the opportunity to authorize the repository management service to access additional online repositories through the user
interface 500.  For example, the user may click on the icon 510 or 512 to sign-in to the "Social Media Account A" or the "Social Media Account B", respectively.  Furthermore, once the user signs in to one of the social media accounts, the user may be
prompted to give the repository management service permission to access specific media content within the social media account, and a token may be used to provide the repository management service with a method for verifying the access permission granted
by the user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is an illustration of an embodiment of user interface 600 for media content insertion that may be displayed by a user device in response to a selection by a user of a repository from which to obtain media content.  Like numbered items are
as described with respect to FIGS. 4 and 5.  The user interface 600 may be generated from the user interface 500 in response to a user's click on the "See More" icon 506 that is associated with the images 504 from the "User Name's Social Media Account"
repository 502 described with respect to FIG. 5.  The user interface 600 may display any number of the photo albums 602 stored within the "User Name's Social Media Account" repository 502.  In addition, the user interface 604 may include a search box
604, which may allow the user to specify search criteria for the displaying of the photo albums 602 or the individual photos within the photo albums 602.  In an embodiment, the search box 604 may display a message for the user, such as "Search My
Photos."
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, the user interface 600 displays information 606 pertaining to the media content within the currently-opened repository.  The information 606 may include, for example, the number of albums in the repository or the date
that the repository was last updated.  Furthermore, the user interface 600 may include an "Insert" icon 608 for inserting a selected image into the Microsoft.RTM.  Office document, as well as a "Cancel" icon 610 for cancelling the image insertion
procedure and exiting the user interface 600.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a block diagram showing a tangible, computer-readable medium 700 that stores code adapted to allow for the insertion of media content from multiple repositories into a location through a user interface.  The tangible, computer-readable
medium 700 may be accessed by a processor 702 over a computer bus 704.  Furthermore, the tangible, computer-readable medium 700 may include code configured to direct the processor 702 to perform the steps of the current method.
<br/><br/> The various software components discussed herein may be stored on the tangible, computer-readable medium 700, as indicated in FIG. 7.  For example, a media content insertion module 706 may be configured to allow for the insertion of media
content form multiple local or online repositories into a document, presentation, or Website.  The media content may include photos, videos, or audio content, or any combination thereof.  Moreover, the media content insertion module 706 may be hosted
within a program or application on a user device, wherein the user device may be any type of computing device capable of supporting such media content.  Furthermore, the tangible, computer-readable medium 700 may include any number of additional software
components not shown in FIG. 7.
