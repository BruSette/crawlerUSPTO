<br/><br/> The following relates generally to establishing communication connectivity between two persons.  More specifically, the following relates to establishing communication between two persons when a selected method of communication is unsuccessful.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Many individuals have more than one telephone number, email address, instant messaging identifier and other communication identifier (ID).  Quite commonly, a user or the sender of a communication will unsuccessfully attempt to connect with a
recipient using one or more such identifiers.  This commonly occurs with telephone communication; however, failure to connect via email is also common due to invalid email addresses or out-of-office settings.  For example, a sender may fail to connect
with a recipient via a home phone number and will have to spend time locating alternative phone numbers or email addresses to make subsequent attempts to reach that recipient.
<br/><br/> When a sender unsuccessfully attempts to communicate with a recipient, most commonly by phone, most existing redial options generally redial the same phone number that was previously attempted.  Selecting another number is generally a long
process whereby the sender must: (a) exit the existing ID screen for the recipient; (b) find and select another ID for the recipient; and (c) re-perform the previous steps to attempt to establish a connection.  Further, manual selection of another ID may
not result in the best choice for desired connection due to timing, invalid numbers or emails, etc.
<br/><br/> An issue with existing redial methods is that it is time consuming for the sender to connect with recipients.  In addition, existing redial methods lack a systematic approach to reaching or connecting with a recipient.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Embodiments will now be described with reference to the figures.  It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration, where considered appropriate, reference numerals may be repeated among the figures to indicate
corresponding or analogous elements.  In addition, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments described herein.  However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments
described herein may be practised without these specific details.  In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the embodiments described herein.  Also, the description is not
to be considered as limiting the scope of the embodiments described herein.
<br/><br/> It will also be appreciated that any engine, unit, module, component, server, computer, terminal or device exemplified herein that executes instructions may include or otherwise have access to computer readable media, such as, for example,
storage media, computer storage media, or data storage devices (removable and/or non-removable) such as, for example, magnetic disks, optical disks, or tape.  Computer storage media may include volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media
implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as, for example, computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data.  Examples of computer storage media include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other

<br/><br/> The following provides a system and method for intelligent redial.  The system comprises an intelligent redial application or service executable or accessible on a computing device.  Many individuals have more than one telephone number, email
address, instant messaging identifier and other communication ID.  Quite commonly, a sender will unsuccessfully attempt to connect with a recipient using one or more such IDs.  A sender may update her contact information locally, using a contact
management application on a computing device, or via a contact management service available as a cloud service.  The contact information is used to attempt to communicate with a recipient and comprises recipient IDs.
<br/><br/> An illustrative embodiment comprises a plurality of definitions for determining that a connection has been made depending on the method used to establish communication.  For example, when attempting connection via telephone, connection may be
defined as being able to speak with or hear the recipient in real time and, conversely, failure of connection may defined as when a busy tone or notification of a disconnected phone is received, or voicemail is reached by the sender attempting
connection.  When attempting connection via email or short messaging service (SMS), connection may be defined as an email or SMS being received by the recipient and, conversely, failure of connection as the recipient not having received the email or SMS
due to a message delivery failure, notification of a disconnected number or out-of-office notification.
<br/><br/> In the following, "sender" refers to any person who desires to connect with a recipient; "recipient" refers to any individual the sender has recipient IDs for; "contact information" refers to all aspects of recipient IDs including, but not
limited to, phone number, fax number, email address, instant messaging ID, proprietary messaging medium ID, social network ID, etc. for the recipient; and "recipient detail" refers to one specific contact information ID including, but not limited to, one
phone number, one fax number, one email address, one instant messaging ID, one proprietary messaging medium ID, one social network ID, etc.
<br/><br/> It will be appreciated that several approaches for enabling a sender to select a first item of recipient detail for a recipient are provided in the art.  These include typical "address book" applications and services accessible via mobile phone
devices.
<br/><br/> In the present disclosure, a sender may provide instructions to an address book, or an application that utilizes an address book, or the like to initiate communication with a recipient.  As provided herein, the user selects a recipient listed in
the address book.  The intelligent redial application subsequently determines a medium of communication with the recipient by selecting one or an ordered list of one or more recipient details for the recipient and causes the sender's device to address
any communication to the recipient at the first recipient detail.  The intelligent redial application initiates communication using one of the recipient details as determined by the order.  Once the sender has transmitted the communication to the
recipient at the first recipient detail, the intelligent redial application determines whether the communication has been received by the recipient.  In the case that communication failed between the sender and the recipient, the intelligent redial
application may either suggest to the sender a subsequent recipient detail to reinitiate communication with the recipient, automatically select a subsequent recipient detail to reinitiate communication with the recipient, or present a plurality of
recipient detail options to the user to enable sender selection of one recipient detail to reinitiate communication with the recipient.
<br/><br/> Referring first to FIG. 1, an exemplary intelligent redial application is illustrated as executable upon a computing device (100).  The computing device (100) may be, for example, a PC, laptop, tablet, smartphone or other device having a
processor (102) and memory (104), the memory (104) having stored thereon computer instructions which when executed by the processor (102) cause the following operations to be performed.  The intelligent redial application further stores and retrieves
contact information and recipient clusters to the memory (104).
<br/><br/> A recipient cluster is a collection of data including connection and communication attempt information, recipient tendencies, and rules for ideal connection paths, and may be continuously updated by the intelligent redial application.  The
intelligent redial application may update the recipient cluster based on successful or failed attempts at connection or communication.  Updating may comprise storing: time of attempted communication, reason for failed attempted communication, recipient
detail used for successful communication attempt, etc. For example, details stored in the recipient cluster may include for a specific recipient (a) the number of recipient details stored for that recipient and the types of recipient detail; (b) the time
zone and area code associated to each recipient detail; (c) any indications as to whether the recipient detail is for home, work, mobile, etc.; (d) schedule information related to a recipient; (e) history of any reasons for which any of the recipient
details were not able to be reached in prior attempts, etc.
<br/><br/> In further embodiments, the recipient cluster may include data attached to specific recipient details.  For example, details stored in the recipient cluster may include for a specific recipient detail (a) the phone number is for a home, (b) the
home phone number was tried at 5:00 pm and during regular office hours, (c) the phone number has been successfully connected with 4 times out of 8 attempts, etc.
<br/><br/> In still further embodiments, the recipient cluster may include social relationship contact data for specific recipients as another way to reach a recipient may be by attempting to connect with the spouse, child, parent, administrative
assistant, employment head office, etc. For example, details stored in the recipient cluster may include for a specific recipient (a) the phone number of their spouse, (b) the phone number of their administrative assistant, (c) the phone number of their
business partner, etc. Alternatively, the intelligent redial application may be linked by network to one or more social networks from which the application can determine other contacts with which the recipient is related socially, and can attempt to
contact socially related persons as a proxy for contacting the intended recipient.
<br/><br/> In an aspect, the recipient cluster may be populated with social relationship contact data collected from social media or public data sources.  When social relationship contact data is unavailable for a given recipient, the system may search for
various relationships online.  For example, in attempting to communicate with the recipient, the system may search social networks to determine who is the spouse, child, parent, administrative assistant, employment head office, etc., of the client.  Upon
obtaining this information, the application may either (a) determine that it has a recipient cluster for that person; (b) establish a recipient cluster for that person and link the original recipient's cluster to this recipient cluster; or (c) add the
person's contact detail to the original recipient's cluster.  Relationships and details such as phone number, social media handle, address, etc. may be extracted from online sources employing natural language processing rules.
<br/><br/> In a further aspect, each social relationship contact may be extracted from the recipient cluster and stored as an individual recipient in the sender's address book.  Furthermore, where a sender has recipient details for two distinct recipients,
the system may populate the respective recipient cluster with relationship contact data obtainable from online sources.  For example, where the sender attempts to communicate with recipient A, the system may identify that recipient A is married to
recipient B, for which the sender may or may not have recipient details for.  The system may either populate recipient details for recipient B using data found online or may already be in possession of recipient details for recipient B and automatically
attempt to communicate with them upon failing to communicate with recipient A.
<br/><br/> The recipient cluster may include an indication as to the time of day the social relationship contact may be with or in communication with the recipient.  Like recipient details, social relationship contact data may include details such as the
best contact details to use for the social relationship contact based on time of day or day of the week, etc.
<br/><br/> Social relationship contacts may be stored in levels depending on how closely related the social relationship contact is to the intended recipient.  For example, where the intended communication is for business purposes, the first and closest
level to the intended recipient may include the administrative assistant or business partner of the recipient.  Similarly, a second level to the intended recipient may include the spouse of the administrative assistant or the spouse of the business
partner of the recipient.  In a further example, where the intended communication is for social purposes, the first and closest level to the intended recipient may include spouse or sibling of the recipient, whereas, the second level to the intended
recipient may include the administrative assistant of the spouse or the spouse of the sibling.  It will be appreciated that the examples of relationships mentioned herein are for illustrative purposes alone and may be substituted with any other type of
relationship appropriate for attempting communication with the recipient.  In another example, where the intended communication is to establish communication with the recipient as soon as possible, the appropriate social relationship contact may be
selected based on level and time or day.  Levels may be configured by the sender or automatically implemented by rules for ideal connection paths.
<br/><br/> In further embodiments, the intelligent redial application may continuously re-order the recipient details in the recipient cluster to determine the ideal order for attempting communication.  The intelligent redial application allocates a score
for how likely it will be to reach the recipient detail based on the time of day, past connection attempt history, etc. As these scores will change based on the factors known, available and relevant at given times on given days, the application may
re-order recipient details in real-time.
<br/><br/> The computing device (100) further comprises a user interface (106) comprising an input device (110) such as a keyboard, mouse, speaker, or touchscreen and an output device (108) such as a monitor or other display, for example a touchscreen.
<br/><br/> The intelligent redial application enables the sender to (a) attempt to connect with a recipient across a plurality of communications platforms using an intelligent redial application interface, which enables the sender to select from contact
information including a plurality of phone numbers, email addresses, instant messaging addresses, fax numbers, social media handles, website addresses, etc.; (b) receive notification of the outcome of attempted connection; and (c) select or provide
instructions to attempt another connection approach when the prior attempt has failed.
<br/><br/> The intelligent redial application exchanges communication requests and approvals by communicating via a network connection, such as the internet, with corresponding contact management applications or message composition applications, each of
which may operate a respective contact management application or message composition application providing similar functionality.  Communication between senders and recipients may be accomplished via peer-to-peer communication between their respective
computing devices and/or specifically via their respective intelligent redial applications, or through a hosted communication exchange (e.g., through a server).  Alternatively, communication may be enabled via SMS, preferably equipped with code exchange
for authentication, including by a public or private key infrastructure.  In embodiments where a server host is used, the server may provide caching and/or scheduled delivery of updates and requests, for example for load balancing or in cases where the
target computing device is not available/online.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, intelligent redial may be provided via an intelligent redial service hosted in the cloud.  Communications in this embodiment can be handled by any protocol, including proprietary, operative on the service.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary workflow for intelligent redial information is provided.  In block 200, a sender has accessed their intelligent redial service and selected a recipient to attempt to establish a connection with.
<br/><br/> In block 202, the sender may further initiate a request to communicate with her recipient using recipient detail A. In block 204, the intelligent redial application attempts to establish connection with the recipient's device.  In block 206 a
message may be generated by the recipient identifying that connection was not established using recipient detail A. The failed attempt is stored in memory as part of the recipient cluster indicating that the recipient detail A has failed for connection
at that time 208.  In further embodiments, where an attempt is successful, it will be stored as part of the recipient cluster corresponding to the relevant recipient detail.
<br/><br/> In further embodiments, rather than the sender initiate a request to attempt to establish a connection with her recipient using recipient detail A, as in block 202, the sender may simply specify the recipient and the intelligent redial
application may automatically select recipient detail A from the recipient cluster.
<br/><br/> In embodiments, the sender may configure whether they would like communication attempts to be made exclusively through telephone, email, SMS or a combination thereof.  The intelligent redial application stores the preference by adding it to the
recipient cluster.
<br/><br/> In further embodiments, the sender may configure whether communication attempts should include social relationship contact data for specific recipients as well as how many levels of social relationship contact data should be included in order to
attempt communication.  The sender may also configure which specific social relationship contacts should be attempted to make communication with the recipient.
<br/><br/> In block 210, the sender's intelligent redial application presents the sender via the output device with a prompt to either cease attempting connection or continue attempting to connect with the recipient.  If the sender approves the
continuance, the recipient cluster stored in memory is accessed by the intelligent redial application 212, recipient detail B is suggested to the sender 214 and blocks 204-210 are to be repeated.
<br/><br/> In still further embodiments, rather than using the intelligent redial application to attempt connection with recipient detail B, the sender may manually select the subsequent recipient detail to use for attempted connection.
<br/><br/> A sender may initiate communication or approve continuance by communicating with the user interface verbally, through a touch screen interface, or any other means of input supported by the user input device.  The sender may verbally communicate
by speaking.  For example the sender may say "Retry same recipient detail", "Try suggested recipient detail", "Try home", "Try work", "Try email", "Try text", etc. In still further embodiments, the sender may select from a menu presented to the sender on
the user interface using touch or other sensory commands.  In still further embodiments, the intelligent redial application may be configured to include smart press commands.  In aspects, a letter, numeral, or combination of letters and/or numerals may
be configured to initiate communication or approve continuation when said letter, number or combination is selected.  For example, the sender selecting "R" on the keypad may retry the same recipient detail, "RM" may attempt to establish a connection with
the recipient mobile, "RH" may attempt to establish a connection with the recipient home, etc.
<br/><br/> In further embodiments, the sender may configure the order in which they would like to attempt connection for a given recipient.  At any time, the sender may provide instructions to the intelligent redial application using the user interface
indicating the order in which a recipient's recipient details should be attempted.  For example, the sender may give the following voice command: "Call Bob at home then work, then work email, then home email, then text, then <b><i>Facebook</i></b> chat."
<br/><br/> In further embodiments, the recipient may configure the order in which they would like to be reached using a contact management system.  The recipient may communicate a preferred order to through any of the computing device connections mentioned
above.
<br/><br/> In further embodiments, the sender may configure the intelligent redial application to perform the redial automatically and continuously.  The sender may provide instructions to the intelligent redial application using the user interface to
continuously attempt to establish a connection with a recipient indefinitely or until the sender provides a stop command.
<br/><br/> It will be appreciated that a sender may use the intelligent redial application to attempt connection with a single recipient or a plurality of recipients where such connection is supported by the method of communication.  For example, if
attempting a conference call, a sender may attempt to establish a connection with a plurality of recipients and each may be intelligently redialed.  In a further example, an email or group SMS may make use of the aforementioned batch communication
method.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 3, an illustrative embodiment of a system whereby the sender has configured the intelligent redial application to perform the redial automatically is presented.
<br/><br/> In block 300, the intelligent redial application may be instructed to attempt to establish a connection with recipient A or a plurality of recipients.  In block 302, the intelligent redial application accesses the recipient cluster for that
recipient.  In block 304, the intelligent redial application selects the ideal recipient detail to attempt first based on the recipient cluster ordering at that moment.  In block 306, intelligent redial application communicates with the computing device
belonging to recipient detail A. In block 308, the intelligent redial application receives a notification that a connection has not been made.  In block 310, the intelligent redial application selects a subsequent recipient detail to attempt.
<br/><br/> In block 310, the intelligent redial application updates the recipient cluster as described in more detail above.
<br/><br/> Although the invention has been described with reference to certain specific embodiments, various modifications thereof will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as outlined in the
claims appended hereto.  The entire disclosures of all references recited above are incorporated herein by reference.
