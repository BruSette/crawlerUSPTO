       <p> Systems and methods of rendering a three-dimensional (3D) virtual
     environment rendering are disclosed. The system comprises a central
     processing device, a plurality of user devices in data communication with
     the central processing device, a plurality of application servers in data
     communication with the central processing device, and software executing
     on the central processor. The software creates and renders a 3D virtual
     environment, receives user data from each of the plurality of user
     devices, renders the user data received from each of the user devices in
     the 3D virtual environment, receives application data from each of the
     application servers, renders the application data received from each of
     the application servers in the 3D virtual environment, and outputs the
     rendered 3D virtual environment to each of the user devices. The 3D
     virtual environment serves as a direct user interface with the Internet
     by allowing users to visually navigate the world wide web.

<br/><br/> This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No.
     61/717,457 filed Oct. 23, 2012 and entitled "Three-Dimensional Virtual
     Environment," the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated
     herein by reference.
         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>The invention claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A three-dimensional (3D) virtual environment rendering system, comprising: a central processing device;  a plurality of user devices in data communication with the
central processing device;  a plurality of application servers in data communication with the central processing device;  and software executing on the central processing device, wherein the software: creates and renders a 3D virtual environment; 
receives user data from each of the plurality of user devices;  renders the user data received from each of the user devices in the 3D virtual environment;  receives application data from each of the application servers;  renders the application data
received from each of the application servers in the 3D virtual environment;  and outputs the rendered 3D virtual environment to each of the user devices;  wherein the 3D virtual environment serves as a direct user interface with an Internet by allowing
users to interact and simultaneously visually navigate a world wide web;  and wherein the user views the 3D virtual environment through a heads up display (HUD) adapted to interface with the user's user device, cloud-based computing services, the central
processing device, and the 3D virtual environment, wherein the HUD is overlaid on the 3D virtual environment and displays applications that at least one of allow the user to interact with the 3D virtual environment, provides the user with information
pertaining to the 3D virtual environment or the real world, and allows the user to access data on the user's device or cloud storage associated with a user's account.
<br/><br/> 2.  The system of claim 1, wherein application data rendered in the 3D virtual environment affects each user's interactions with the 3D virtual environment.
<br/><br/> 3.  The system of claim 2, wherein at least a portion of the application data rendered in the 3D virtual environment creates one of a virtual store, a user's avatar, a user's virtual storage, virtual scenery, another structure, a product,
functions or scripts that affect the 3D virtual environment, applications or collections of scripts, objects that represent applications, objects that represent functions, structures with applications and functions as a package, a representation of a
real world object or combinations thereof.
<br/><br/> 4.  The system of claim 1, wherein the application data is metadata directing the central processing device to an executable application for rendering in the 3D virtual environment.
<br/><br/> 5.  The system of claim 4, wherein the metadata includes at least one of where the source application exists, who can execute the application, and what events trigger the execution of the application.
<br/><br/> 6.  The system of claim 1, wherein the data received from each user includes at least one of the users IP address, the type of device the user is accessing the 3D virtual environment from, the operating system and version of the user's device,
the browser and version of the user's device, the peripheral components connected to the user's device, and real world location information of the user.
<br/><br/> 7.  The system of claim 1, wherein the central processing device renders a unique view of the 3D virtual environment for each user that is based on the location of the user within the 3D virtual environment and changes as the user navigates
though the 3D virtual environment.
<br/><br/> 8.  The system of claim 1, wherein the 3D virtual environment is divided into a plurality of zones, wherein each zone is associated with at least one application that dictates the ability of users to interact the 3D virtual environment within
the zone.
<br/><br/> 9.  The system of claim 8, wherein each zone covers at least a portion of the 3D virtual environment or is associated with an object within the 3D virtual environment.
<br/><br/> 10.  The system of claim 8, wherein at least a portion of the users control portions of the 3D virtual environment and the users are presented with the option of creating and editing zones in the portions of the 3D virtual environment within

<br/><br/> 1.  Field of the Invention
<br/><br/> The invention is directed to systems and methods of creating, hosting, and accessing a three-dimensional (3D) virtual environment.  Specifically, the invention is directed to systems and methods of creating, hosting, and accessing an on-line 3D
virtual environment.  More specifically, the invention is directed to systems and methods of creating, forming, expanding, and displaying a 3D virtual environment, and to portraying, identifying, and accessing websites on the internet.  The invention is
additionally directed to systems and methods for enabling the public to create, host, and access on-line 3D virtual environments and 3D content, and to systems and methods enabling individuals to directly participate in societal activities within a 3D
virtual environment.
<br/><br/> 2.  Background of the Invention
<br/><br/> The Internet has evolved to include, among other aspects, communication tools, images, videos, gaming, commerce, and social media.  The Internet is currently evolving toward the next generation of capability which will be able to more fully
exploit the advantages of 3D virtual environments and content.  Furthermore, the availability of 3D content is growing exponentially.  The number of smart TVs, mobile devices, and other electronics which can connect to the Internet and exploit 3D
capabilities is also growing exponentially.
<br/><br/> The current systems and methods of accessing websites on the Internet are typically based on traditional two-dimensional (2D) website displays and textual addresses (such as a URL representing an IP address).  The number of people who visit a
particular website are usually counted and tallied into a number which is characterized as the website's "traffic".  Additionally, people may "move" between two different websites via webpage links in a nearly instantaneous time frame.  This internet
"traffic" is invisible to the website's viewers and other website owners.  While it is possible to track and tally the traffic between a specific pair of websites, the invisible traffic data is unavailable to individuals and owners of other websites due
to the direct and nearly instantaneous nature of internet connections.
<br/><br/> When visiting current 2D websites, visitors are able to interact with the various services the website offers, such as information, shopping, socializing, email, or limited computational services.  However, interaction with current 2D websites
is often not intuitive and the processes offered are not similar to normal everyday experiences and actions of humans and society in general.  In other words, current interfaces with a 2D websites require some specific user skills or experience to fully
benefit from all that the website offers.  The actions required to access and interact with the websites are not necessarily natural actions that people perform on a regular basis in real life.  Many people find it difficult to understand and efficiently
navigate the Internet and the World Wide Web.  Users may find it difficult to utilize the various non-standard interfaces of connected computers and devices and often may find it difficult to understand what service or product options the websites are
presenting to them.  Additionally, users may find it difficult to understand the structure, the organization of information and services, and the location of products as they navigate from one website to another since each website has its own manner of
sorting and presenting the information.  An unfortunate fact is that many people have limited abilities to access or relate to Internet websites due to a lack of knowledge of the necessary processes or some other experience limitation that reduces the
effectiveness of their time spent.  Thus, many people are unable to realize all of the benefits of the Internet because the actions required by existing 2D interfaces do not mimic the actions they would take in the real world to achieve the same result. 
Current 2D websites are inherently limiting in that a user requires a level of experience and web savvy to fully benefit.
<br/><br/> There have been a number of strong pushes to build vast 3D virtual environments.  All attempts have been based on a centralized system architecture and a static engine operated by a single host, whereby businesses, organizations, and individuals
are confined to the host environment.
<br/><br/> Access to current centralized 3D environments is limited to a direct visit by an internet user.  Once connected to the website visitors are limited to the environment created and hosted by the website owner.  Visitors are represented by an
avatar which has a range of basic and optional abilities, and, through user input, can be moved to various locations in the environment.  Virtual structures and locations represent places to visit within the environment, but what is possible at these
virtual locations is limited to user capabilities provided by the website host and is normally identical to any other location within the environment.  Using this model, existing 3D environment builders have not created practical traffic flows to attract
businesses nor the commerce tools to enable user-friendly and effective transactions in the 3D environments.  Broadly speaking, they have not yet generated 3D environments which enable users to execute the full range of internet potential.
<br/><br/> There are some 3D websites which offer the possibility to purchase or otherwise acquire new items to expand the number of objects within the 3D environment or change the look of an avatar or object.  However, no known 3D environment offers
individuals and organizations the ability to directly create and apply new technologies to the environment itself or to create completely new applications and capabilities that add to, alter, and advance the 3D environment itself and its overall
productivity.  Such an approach is inherently self-limiting since improvements to the existing 3D environments, such as entirely new capabilities, are limited to and wholly dependent on items or capabilities directly offered by the resources and
capabilities of the website host.  Thus, greater creativity and innovation within the website is limited because users cannot directly create new advancements or alter the 3D environment without host involvement.  Such user participation has been the
primary driver behind the evolution of the internet to date and is the key to enabling a fully capable 3D internet to evolve.
<br/><br/> The current 3D environments do not incorporate other website 3D content in a networked, cooperative manner and do not enable open expansion of 3D content beyond the website itself.  The existing 3D environments additionally do not open expansion
of the environment boundaries beyond the website itself, or efficient and open development of new capabilities across the board.  By not being networked, other existing 3D environments are not visible to users while they are traversing the host 3D
environment.  The inability to identify other websites or environments from within the 3D environment means current 3D environments cannot act as an effective interface to the larger internet.  By not being able to visualize the internet (able to observe
visible representations of other websites simultaneously from within the 3D environment) users do not have a way to interface with the internet itself other than navigating away from the website hosting the closed 3D environment they are visiting.
<br/><br/> Attempts so far to spark evolution of the 2D internet into a 3D internet have not kept the 2D interface advantages in mind (such as instantaneous access to information and navigation).  While in a single existing 3D environment website, users
are often unable to take full advantage of several other common internet enabled services (such as email, social media, and search functions), because the 2D interfaces within the 3D environments do not effectively and fully integrate these services into
the 3D environment.  Instead, the 2D interface, if available within the environment is generally a standalone action and causes users to trade off some 2D web advantages in order to operate in the 3D environment.  In the process, they do not effectively
integrate with the 3D environment and retain full 2D internet effectiveness.
<br/><br/> Thus there is a need for a 3D world wide web comprised of a system of networked 3D virtual environments which operate together as a single larger integrated 3D virtual environment.  There is also a need for a "Visual Network Environment" that
can display a representation of multiple internet websites simultaneously as a single, large, and integrated 3D virtual environment.  A 3D virtual environment will provide an intuitive structure and spatial organization to the many websites available now
and in the future.  The need is for a decentralized 3D virtual environment that is not just another website on the Internet, but rather a 3D environment serving as a user interface for the entire Internet, and which, for all practical purposes,
represents both the internet websites and the internet users.  Such an integrated 3D environment will enable individuals to take advantage of internet capabilities using the same intuitive actions they execute every day in the physical world.
<br/><br/> There is also a need for a method within a system of networked 3D virtual environments comprising a 3D World Wide Web that will allow individuals and organizations to include, control, protect, and advance their 3D content and operations within
the single larger integrated environment.
<br/><br/> Likewise, there is a need for a visual interface which integrates 2D website advantages and tools with 3D environment tools and capabilities without leaving the 3D environment.  Such an interface is preferably not simply another browser display
that makes 2D websites available from the 3D environment but rather an interface, fully integrated into the 3D environment display, which retains 2D advantages within the 3D environment.
<br/><br/> Additionally, there is a need for a system and method to provide an inherent capability for individuals and organizations to directly participate in the expansion and technological advancement of the 3D visual network environment content and to
directly create, add to, alter, or otherwise improve user capabilities within the environment in a manner consistent with the real world environment.

<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> As embodied and broadly described herein, the disclosures herein provide detailed embodiments of the invention.  However, the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. 
Therefore, there is no intent that specific structural and functional details should be limiting, but rather the intention is that they provide a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ
the present invention
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 1, an exemplary system includes at least one general-purpose computing device 100, including a processing unit (CPU) 120 and a system bus 110 that couples various system components including the system memory such as read
only memory (ROM) 140 and random access memory (RAM) 150 to the processing unit 120.  Other system memory 130 may be available for use as well.  It can be appreciated that the invention may operate on a computing device with more than one CPU 120 or on a
group or cluster of computing devices networked together to provide greater processing capability.  The system bus 110 may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any
of a variety of bus architectures.  A basic input/output (BIOS) stored in ROM 140 or the like, may provide the basic routine that helps to transfer information between elements within the computing device 100, such as during start-up.  The computing
device 100 further includes storage devices such as a hard disk drive 160, a magnetic disk drive, an optical disk drive, tape drive or the like.  The storage device 160 is connected to the system bus 110 by a drive interface.  The drives and the
associated computer readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computing device 100.  The basic components are known to those of skill in the art and appropriate
variations are contemplated depending on the type of device, such as whether the device is a small, handheld computing device, a desktop computer, a computer server, a handheld scanning device, or a wireless devices, including wireless Personal Digital
Assistants ("PDAs"), tablet devices, wireless web-enabled or "smart" phones (e.g., Research in Motion's Blackberry.TM., an Android.TM.  device, Apple's iPhone.TM.), other wireless phones, a game console (e.g, a Playstation.TM., an Xbox.TM., or a
Wii.TM.), a Smart TV, a wearable internet connected device, etc. Preferably, the system is technology agnostic.
<br/><br/> Although the exemplary environment described herein employs the hard disk, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data that are accessible by a computer, such as magnetic
cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, cartridges, random access memories (RAMs), read only memory (ROM), a cable or wireless signal containing a bit stream and the like, may also be used in the exemplary operating environment.
<br/><br/> To enable user interaction with the computing device 100, an input device 190 represents any number of input mechanisms, such as a microphone for speech, a touch-sensitive screen for gesture or graphical input, keyboard, mouse, motion input,
speech, game console controller, TV remote and so forth.  The output device 170 can be one or more of a number of output mechanisms known to those of skill in the art, for example, printers, monitors, projectors, speakers, and plotters.  In some
embodiments, the output can be via a network interface, for example uploading to a website, emailing, attached to or placed within other electronic files, and sending an SMS or MMS message.  In some instances, multimodal systems enable a user to provide
multiple types of input to communicate with the computing device 100.  The communications interface 180 generally governs and manages the user input and system output.  There is no restriction on the invention operating on any particular hardware
arrangement and therefore the basic features here may easily be substituted for improved hardware or firmware arrangements as they are developed.
<br/><br/> For clarity of explanation, the illustrative system embodiment is presented as comprising individual functional blocks (including functional blocks labeled as a "processor").  The functions these blocks represent may be provided through the use
of either shared or dedicated hardware, including, but not limited to, hardware capable of executing software.  For example the functions of one or more processors presented in FIG. 1 may be provided by a single shared processor or multiple processors. 
(Use of the term "processor" should not be construed to refer exclusively to hardware capable of executing software.) Illustrative embodiments may comprise microprocessor and/or digital signal processor (DSP) hardware, read-only memory (ROM) for storing
software performing the operations discussed below, and random access memory (RAM) for storing results.  Very large scale integration (VLSI) hardware embodiments, as well as custom VLSI circuitry in combination with a general purpose DSP circuit, may
also be provided.
<br/><br/> Embodiments within the scope of the present invention may also include computer-readable media for carrying or having computer-executable instructions or data structures stored thereon.  Such computer-readable media can be any available media
that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer.  By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic
storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures.  When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications
connection (either hardwired, wireless, or combination thereof) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a computer-readable medium.  Thus, any such connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium.  Combinations of the above
should also be included within the scope of the computer-readable media.
<br/><br/> Computer-executable instructions include, for example, instructions and data which cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. 
Computer-executable instructions also include program modules that are executed by computers in stand-alone or network environments.  Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, and data structures, etc. that perform
particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types.  Computer-executable instructions, associated data structures, and program modules represent examples of the program code means for executing steps of the methods disclosed herein.  The
particular sequence of such executable instructions or associated data structures represents examples of corresponding acts for implementing the functions described in such steps.
<br/><br/> Those of skill in the art will appreciate the preferred embodiments of the invention may be practiced in network computing environments with many types of computer system configurations, including personal computers, hand-held devices,
multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like.  Networks may include the Internet, one or more Local Area Networks ("LANs"), one or more Metropolitan Area
Networks ("MANs"), one or more Wide Area Networks ("WANs"), one or more Intranets, etc. Embodiments may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by local and remote processing devices that are linked (either by
hardwired links, wireless links, or by a combination thereof) through a communications network, e.g. in the "cloud." In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.
<br/><br/> Augmented 3D (A3D)
<br/><br/> Augmented 3D (A3D) is preferably comprised of three components: (1) the visual network environment, (2) a heads up display (HUD) type user interface, and (3) augmented virtual reality (AVR) information overlaid on the virtual environment.  The
components, when combined, preferably result in a single integrated user interface for web interfacing, interaction between users, and personal computing activities delivered as an immersive and unified user experience.
<br/><br/> (1) The visual network environment (VNE) is preferably comprised of a network of distributed servers which may be geographically separated and/or on a local area network, some of which may be independently owned and operated (for example as
shown in FIG. 2).  Preferably, each server contains 3D object data, environment data, and other web data or information, which may when rendered as a whole comprise a larger virtual environment.  Preferably, the virtual environment is centrally rendered
(e.g. in the cloud) with a common engine and is streamed to users as a single interactive virtual environment (or a holistic 3D web interface).  Preferably the content of the VNE is distributed across the web and can be accessed and rendered as a whole
to visualize the network content.  The VNE preferably visualizes the web and the web traffic as a single virtual environment that users navigate through by controlling an avatar.  For example, the virtual environment may be comprised of virtual
structures and each virtual structure in the environment may represent the IP address of a server in the network or web at large.  Throughout the this document the term "virtual environment" (VE) or "environment" refer to the Visual Network Environment
(described herein), however no use of the term "VE" is intended to apply only to the term "VNE" and any components or inventions contained herein may apply to virtual environments in general.
<br/><br/> (2) The HUD is preferably the user's 2D interface for applications and information.  The HUD integrates the user's personal computing activities and allows them to interface with web applications pertaining to the virtual environment, their
personal storage, and the world wide web, at large.  Applications (apps) on a user's HUD may have been purchased from an app store and may be designed specifically for HUD use to provide information about the virtual environment and provide accessibility
options for other applications and information.  For example, a Twitter app may provide interactive Twitter feeds on the HUD, or a Pandora app may provide station control buttons on the HUD to control a user's music.  The HUD is the user's cloud based
desktop for their cloud computer, or user instance with associated storage space.
<br/><br/> (3) Augmented Virtual Reality (AVR) preferably is information created by property owners throughout the environment can be seen by users as translucent, floating, interactive information in the virtual environment.  Such information can be
overlaid on the environment and pertain to avatars, objects, or places in the environment using the "AVR/AR Editor" described herein.  AVR is similar to augmented reality (AR) in the real world.  An example of real world AR is interactive, translucent,
floating information viewable to a person in the real world using an AR device, such as AR glasses or camera phones with appropriate apps.
<br/><br/> The VNE, HUD, and AVR, when combined and delivered as a single user experience, can be called "A3D".  It creates a unique interface that integrates 2D and 3D web interfacing and exploration, personal computing activities and user collaboration
and interaction.  A3D enables users to, for example, simultaneously move through the 3D virtual environment, visit businesses and other web presences, interact with other users in the virtual environment, interface with 2D applications and information
pertaining to the virtual environment, interface with the web at large, and perform personal computing activities.
<br/><br/> System Infrastructure
<br/><br/> Throughout this document, the use of the terms "stream(s)," "streaming" and "transmit(s)" regarding data and other terms regarding data communications between components may be representative of the "routing" of data in the system.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, a switch board server detects each user, collects and/or compiles the user's data in a user data package (UDP) and transmits the UDP to an assignment server.  The switch board server preferably also receives the
location of an assigned user instance from the assignment server and redirects the user to that location.  A UDP is preferably an electronic file or package containing data about a user.  For example, the UDP can contain the IP address of the user's
device, the type of device, the operating system and version, the browser and version, any connected peripheral components, a GPS location of the device, the elevation, horizontal direction and vertical angle of the device, and/or other collected data. 
The assignment server, in communication with the render bank (a collection of user instance processing units), preferably processes the information contained in the UDP, identifies an available user instance in the render bank (a collection of user
instance processing units), and transmits the location of the available user instance to the switchboard server which then redirects the user to the assigned user instance in the render bank.
<br/><br/> Preferably, a user instance is the single or set of processing units in the render bank that users communicate with via the internet.  The user instance preferably streams data to a directory grid server, receives data from "multiple servers" in
the local area network, world wide web, or other network, and processes the data (or "renders" the data) as a graphical virtual environment.  "Multiple servers" may include property servers described herein or servers containing source applications,
source object data and other source data on other servers.  The virtual environment is preferably streamed to the user's device in the form of HD (high definition) streaming video.  Data streamed from the user instance to the directory grid server may
include, for example the user's position on the grid (using a coordinate system), location on the local area network of the user's user instance, and other user inputs.  User inputs may include, for example, video from a web camera, keystrokes on a
keyboard connected to the user's device, mouse inputs, voice inputs from the device's microphone, or other user initiated inputs.  The grid is the coordinate system for the environment, and the objects, data and locations in it; and preferably defines
the dimensions, on an x, y, z axis, of the virtual environment and subsections therein.
<br/><br/> The directory grid server preferably receives data from the user instance, contains or accesses the grid, compiles and tracks data pertaining to the dimensions of properties and zones throughout the environment from other servers, as well as,
data pertaining to what servers contain or are "responsible" for the data associated with the zones and properties.  The directory grid server preferably also streams user data to the servers responsible for the zones and properties that the user is in.
This data may include, for example, user instance location on the network, position of the user on the grid, user inputs, and other information.
<br/><br/> For example, when a user visits a website on the world wide web that has a corresponding 3D property within the virtual environment and the user chooses to view the 3D version, the user is redirected to the virtual environment website.  When the
user connects with the virtual environment website, the switchboard server detects the new IP address of the user's device and the IP address of the website from which the user was redirected, as well as, other UDP data.  The switchboard server transmits
the UDP to the assignment server (which may be a separate server from the switchboard server) on a local area network.  The assignment server processes the UDP and assigns an appropriate available user instance in the render bank for the user to be
redirected to.  The assignment server then transmits the location on the network of the assigned user instance to the switchboard server, which, in turn, redirects the user to the assigned user instance.
<br/><br/> The user instance may contain a suite or set of applications or access cloud based application(s) that receive data from "other servers" on the world wide web or on a local area network that is then rendered as a virtual environment on the user
instance and streamed to the user's device in the form of HD streaming video.  "Other servers" may include property servers described herein or servers containing source applications, source object data and other source data on other servers.  The
location on the grid where the user is introduced into the virtual environment is preferably determined by the assignment server and is based on information obtained in the UDP.  The assignment server may contain or access a database of IP addresses of
websites corresponding with properties in the virtual environment and may match the IP address of the website from which the user was redirected to the virtual environment with a location on the grid.
<br/><br/> The user inputs that enable the user to navigate the environment through the use of an avatar are preferably processed by the user instance to determine in real time where the avatar "is" in the environment and streams the user's position to the
directory grid.  Other data that is streamed to the directory grid server may include the location of the user instance on the network and user inputs.  The directory grid server preferably receives the data from the user instance and may contain or
access the grid and a database of the locations and dimensions of properties in the virtual environment and the locations of the servers containing data pertaining to the properties which may be called "Property Servers".  The directory grid server then
preferably streams the user position on the grid, the location of the user instance on the network and user inputs to the property servers.
<br/><br/> The property servers may contain or have access to a suite or set of applications that enable the administrator of the property server (owner of the property) to create and store zones and to associate applications with the zones, as well as
perform other development activities on the property that effect the user's experience.  In all cases, a user is preferably on at least two properties: the virtual environment property and the individual property owner's property.  This allows for
developments throughout the environment (on all properties) by the virtual environment administrator.  In certain embodiments, when a property is "sold" the virtual environment administrator has no ability to develop functionality accessible on that
property that was sold.  The property server may transmit data to the user instance based on the user's position on the grid and user inputs.  The property server may transmit data pertaining to the user to other servers, which may include servers
containing source applications, source object data and other source data pertaining to the property.  Those other servers may then transmit data to the user instance.  The user instance processes data received from the servers, renders the environment,
and streams video to the user device.
<br/><br/> For example, the complete data or "source" of applications, objects, information and other data that may be on a property, in a property server, or be associated with a property may in some or all cases be contained on servers that are separate
from the property server and the property server may contain only metadata for these.  The user position, location of user instance, and user inputs may be pushed or streamed to these sources from the property server.  The sources may then transmit or
stream data to the user instance to be rendered and streamed to the user device.
<br/><br/> The directory grid server may access or contain a database of the locations (on the grid as well as source of files on the network) of visual items such as structures and objects and may push user data to those object sources based on user
location on the grid (for example as shown in FIG. 3).  These sources may transmit data to be rendered by the user instance.  In this way, even though a user may not have entered a property and the property server may not be sending data, the user may
still see a virtual structure or objects and information on the property as a part of the virtual environment.  In certain embodiments, both the user instance and the directory grid server may have access to a cloud based grid.  In such embodiments, the
user instance preferably tracks the user position and sends this data to the directory grid server to process and communicate to the property servers.  The functions of both the assignment server and switchboard may be performed by a single unit or
separate units.  In certain embodiments, the functions of the assignment server and switchboard may be performed by the render bank and the user may be directed straight to the render bank from 2D websites on the world wide web.  In other words, the
render bank may receive the user, assign the instance, collect and compile the user data package.
<br/><br/> The system and method in which these servers (which may be on a local area network or throughout the world wide web) containing data pertaining to a larger virtual environment communicate and are rendered and streamed to a user allows the
content of a network to be rendered as virtual environment (i.e. a visual network environment).  Additionally, in the above embodiment, the users' inputs that enable their interaction with the environment are transmitted or "routed" throughout the system
and reach source data pertaining to applications, objects and other information which then transmit or "route" data streams to be rendered as the environment and interface on the user instance.  The user instance streams video of the environment and the
results of user interactions in real time.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the grid directory server may redirect a user device or a user instance directly to a property server which may result in two-way communication between the user device or user instance and the property server.  In this
embodiment, the property server may contain source data of applications, objects and other information, and the property server may transmit data as appropriate to the user device or user instance which may render the environment for the user.  In this
case, a property server may be independently owned and operated, and may be independent of the network.
<br/><br/> Zones
<br/><br/> In the preferred embodiment, the virtual environment is divided and sectioned into zones.  Zones are established spatial areas in the virtual environment that have associated applications and storage space where metadata of other applications
and/or data which provide functionality within the zones are stored.  Each time a zone is created a zone manager application is preferably duplicated from a source application in the deed and is stored as a sub-directory under a property directory on a
property server.  Zone managers preferably manage the data in this sub-directory that pertains to the specific zone's dimensions on the grid.  Each zone preferably has its own zone manager application and associated storage space.  The zone manager
preferably stores metadata of apps that are clicked and dragged from the app store to the zone that the zone manager manages.  The apps are preferably stored in the zone's subdirectory.  In a preferred embodiment, metadata is stored because the
executable application is not downloaded by the owner when the app is purchased or otherwise acquired.  Preferably, access to the executable source application is granted for use.  However, in other embodiments the executable application is downloaded
upon purchase or otherwise acquired.  Metadata may include, for example, where the source application exists, who can execute the application, and what events trigger the execution of the application (e.g. a specific user input is received).
<br/><br/> The zone manager preferably receives data from the property manager application regarding the users.  For example the data received by the zone manager may include user inputs, user position on the grid, and user instance location on the
network.  The zone manager preferably transmits user data to source applications associated with that zone.  The apps, in turn, transmit data to the user instance.  Data transmitted to source applications may include user inputs, user position on the
grid, and user instance location on the network.
<br/><br/> Associated apps, whose metadata is stored and managed by the zone manager, preferably determine what can and cannot be done within that zone.  For example, an app may be a jump app that allows an avatar to jump.  Once an owner has clicked and
dragged a jump app to a zone and a user enters the zone, the zone manager accesses the application at its source location.  When the appropriate user input, such as pressing the space bar, is received by the source application as an event trigger the
source application executes and output data is sent to the user instance to process and stream the animation and camera movement of the avatar jumping.  In another embodiment the zone manager application may only transmit data to the application source
and does not receive data from the application source.  In this example, the transmitted data may include user inputs, user location on the grid and user instance location.  When the user leaves the zone they will preferably no longer be able to jump.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, the zone manager may allow, or an app associated with the zone may allow, owners to change which user input triggers an app's execution or features.  For example, an owner may have two apps that are by default
triggered by the same input (e.g. the user pressing the space bar), the owner may change one app to be triggered by another user input (e.g. the user clicking a mouse button).  Other settings may be able to be changed as well.
<br/><br/> Property owners can create zones by, for example, selecting an "add zone" option.  The selection preferably triggers a "development mode" that presents an overhead view of the virtual property and a set of basic shapes (e.g. square, rectangle,
circle, oval, triangle, and trapezoid).  User can then select a shape which may remove the other shapes as options and prompt the owner to click and drag on the overhead view of their property in the location where they would like to place the zone.  The
user can then click and drag the shape to the desired size.  Once the shape has been created on the overhead view, the user may be prompted to select anywhere on the perimeter of the shape to manipulate the shape to cover the precise area that the user
desires.  The user can then add additional shapes that may or may not overlap the previous shape.  When the user has created the areas to be made into a zone the user can then select, for example a "create zone" icon.  The selection preferably
establishes the area(s) defined by the shape(s) as a single zone, ends the "development mode," and reverts back to a first person view.  The user can then continue to interact in the environment.  The user can repeat the process to create additional
zones that may overlap previously created zones.
<br/><br/> Additionally, users can edit zones.  In an edit zone mode, the view may change to an overhead view and display the shapes of the various zones that have been created.  The user can select the zone to be edited and manipulate the shape of the
selected zone or delete it entirely.  The user can click and drag applications from the app store onto the zone to associate that app with the zone.  Preferably, any number of apps can be associated with the zone and/or later removed from the zone.
<br/><br/> Zones on a property that have been created by the property owner preferably cannot exceed the boundaries of their property, however properties may fall within a zone established by the environment administrator where functionality applications
and rules may supersede functionality apps and rules of zones within a property.
<br/><br/> In preferred embodiments, virtual objects can be "converted" to zones.  This enables owners to associate applications with objects and create events that trigger the application to execute.  For example, a user may select an "add zone" option. 
Development mode may then begin in an overhead view with standard shapes presented.  The user can then select a "convert object" option (as opposed to selecting a shape).  The user may choose to return to a "first person" view and navigate to the desired
object.  The user can then select the object, which may become highlighted, and select to create a zone.  The user can then associate a desired application and edit trigger events to execute the application upon, for example a "double click".  A visitor
can thereafter double click the object to launch the associated application on their HUD.  For example, the virtual object may be a radio and the application associated with it may be Pandora.  As another example, a file or folder containing many files
may be associated with a file cabinet that when double clicked presents the user's stored files and folders.
<br/><br/> Additionally, some apps associated with zones may be developed for the purpose of limiting the functionality of the zones or of the avatars to ensure the delivery of the desired user experience.  Zones may be developed by associating
applications that may limit or enable functionality of the zones or of the avatars in the zones.
<br/><br/> Preferably the environment administrator and property owners may associate applications with zones to apply certain characteristics/capabilities which may include sets of human and/or programmed rules and regulations that may be enforced or
abided by.  This may result in multiple zone types including, but not limited to, property zones (including residential, commercial, knowledge, and gaming zones), and hyperlink zones.  Preferably zones and zone types are tools that enable the environment
administrators and property owners to create and maintain areas that deliver specific user experiences and in some cases, limitations.
<br/><br/> Preferably, property zones determine the types of properties that can be constructed within the property zone.  For example, as depicted in FIG. 4, residential zones are preferably maintained for users' "houses" or virtual representations of the
user's computer (as described herein).  Preferably, businesses cannot build stores within residential zones, however users may be able to sell items from their homes under certain, predetermined circumstances.  Residential zones may include both
individual houses and smaller "apartments" or other dwellings.  Property within each zone may be for rent or purchase.
<br/><br/> Similarly, a commercial zone, as depicted in FIG. 5, is preferably maintained for commercial use.  Many types of structures can be built on a commercially zoned property including stores, concert halls, theaters, offices or other structures used
for commercial, community, or organizational purposes.  Stores, for example, can sell products and/or services to users who enter the property.  Preferably, a business can have a number of sales people controlling avatars in the store to communicate with
users.  Furthermore, multiple stores can be located within the same property as in a virtual shopping mall.
<br/><br/> Knowledge Zones are preferably maintained for research and educational purposes.  For example, knowledge zones may be limited to museums, libraries, universities, encyclopedia providers, and the like.  Knowledge zones may exist within
residential and commercial zones.  FIG. 5 also depicts a knowledge zone.
<br/><br/> Zones associated with a hyperlink application may create what would be called a hyperlink zone.  A hyperlink zone is preferably a tool for the developers of properties.  Each hyperlink zone is preferably assigned a hyperlink by developers. 
Hyperlink zones may enable users to activate the hyperlinks, which will direct or link the user to a 2D webpage.  For example, an electronics store may have a hyperlink zone for each product.  When an avatar is within the hyperlink zone and the user
activates the hyperlink, the system may direct the user to the 2D webpage for a product's description and specifications.  Preferably, when directed to the website outside of the environment, a user can toggle back and forth between the 3D environment
and traditional 2D web browsing.  Furthermore, if a user navigates to another web page in the 2D web browser, and toggles to the 3D virtual environment, the user's avatar may "transport" to the location in the 3D environment corresponding to the 2D
webpage.  Thus, navigation in the 3D environment and the 2D browser correlate.  Preferably, developers can add as many or as few hyperlink zones as desired.  If more than one hyperlink is associated with a particular zone or two zones overlap, the user
will preferable be provided with an option of which hyperlink to follow.
<br/><br/> Preferably, there are two ways for the user to activate a hyperlink in a hyperlink zone.  The first is to toggle in and out of the environment, that is, back and forth from the environment and the corresponding 2D website or webpage.  In this
situation the user "toggles" out of the environment, leaving for example the system's website, and going to an entirely different website.  The user can from that point toggle back into the system's website.  The other option is for the user to open the
2D interface/browser on the HUD (as described herein) which will display the website associated with the hyperlink that the avatar is in. The 2D interface on the HUD (browser) can be resized and repositioned on the HUD.  The browser can be "locked" so
that as the avatar moves through the environment the site displayed on the 2D interface will not change without user interaction such as clicking a link on the website displayed in the 2D interface/browser.  The user can surf the web within this 2D
interface as if they were using safari, internet explorer, chrome, etc. If the user navigates away from the site in the 2D interface associated with the hyperlink zone their avatar is in, they can then transport to the structure in the virtual
environment associated with the new website they are viewing in the 2D interface (browser).  The User can "unlock" the browser as well, which will allow the browser to change as they move through hyperlink zones in the virtual environment, displaying the
2D site or page associated with the avatar's position in the virtual environment.
<br/><br/> Zones created in the virtual environment may be associated with and may correspond to an area in augmented reality digital dimension space in the real world.  In other words, when a zone is created in the virtual environment, GPS coordinates may
be applied or merged with the grid coordinates of the virtual environment zone.  Associated application(s) (or metadata of other data) that enable accessibility or parameters for that zone then apply to both and may be visible to an individual using an
augmented reality (AR) device in the real world.
<br/><br/> For example, a user may have, in the real world, an augmented reality device such as AR glasses, which may present the wearer with the user's virtual environment HUD overlaid on the real world.  A store owner in the virtual environment, who owns
a store in the real world, may associate a zone in their virtual environment store, and its associated apps and HUD display information, with a zone in the real world defined by GPS coordinates.  In this way, if a user enters the store in the real world,
their AR glasses will present similar information and applications that are displayed on the user's HUD when they enter the virtual store in the virtual environment.  As an example, an owner can establish a zone within their virtual store and "associate"
or "merge" the zone with GPS coordinates in the real world.  Using a HUD editing application, the owner can then develop a HUD presentation delivering core value propositions of their business that is triggered when a user walks into the zone in the
virtual store.  When a user enters the GPS "zone" in the real world wearing AR glasses, the same HUD display, delivering core value propositions of the business, is also presented to the user.  To create and edit zones, and perform other development
activities that affect the property, the owner can use development applications and tools existing in the deed suite of applications (as described herein).
<br/><br/> AVR/AR Editor
<br/><br/> Augmented virtual reality (AVR) is information throughout the environment that may appear as translucent, floating information and may be stationary and have a set size relative to the environment.  This is similar to augmented reality (AR) in
the real world.  With AVR, when a user is within range of the object (i.e. in its zone), but further away from the object, the information may appear but will be a distance away from the user.  As the user moves closer, the information, along with the
object itself, may get closer.  Users may be able to adjust what AVR information is visible in the environment.  For example, users may, using an application on the HUD, cause certain types of information to be visible that has been created as AVR
throughout the environment by other users.
<br/><br/> An application called, for example, the AVR/AR Editor may enable the owner of a property to create floating text, images, videos, links, and other information that can be seen by users when they enter properties, zones, select products, select
other objects in the virtual environment, or otherwise interact with the virtual environment.  The owner can create this information by creating floating "mini-websites" and associating them with an object or zone.  The owner may be able to then position
the mini-website as desired within the virtual environment.  For example, an owner of a property may open their AVR/AR Editor and use tools in the application to select an object.  The owner may then be presented with an option to create an AVR display. 
The AVR display may be a small "blank page" floating in the virtual environment above the object.  The owner may be presented with options to resize, reshape, and move the AVR display.  The owner may be able to create or paste HTML script into the blank
page.  The script may produce the effect of a floating piece of information relevant to the object (e.g. the object's price) when a user visiting the property selects the object; or the effect can be more interactive.  For example, the effect may bring
up a presentation of value propositions when a user enters the associated zone, the effect may provide images or buttons that can be clicked to provide more information or purchase options for a product, or the effect may be to enable a user to click
"play" on a floating window that will play a video from somewhere else on the web.
<br/><br/> The purpose of the AVR/AR Editor is preferably to enable property owners to effectively deliver interactive information to visitors, or to provide temporary access to tools, services or functions that a user may not have acquired on their HUD or
another zone on the property.  The effect preferably creates floating, translucent information that can be interactive and may be a component of the augmented 3D landscape throughout the virtual environment.  The effect may mimic advanced concepts of
augmented reality in the virtual environment.  In the preferred embodiment, files and images created in typical web development applications and graphics editing programs are able to be placed and interacted with throughout the virtual environment to
provide an interactive augmented reality effect.  In the preferred embodiment, the data pertaining to the "mini-websites" associated with the objects and areas in the virtual environment are stored on storage space associated with the user's account
(e.g. in the property server, personal cloud storage, or other associated storage).
<br/><br/> Preferably the system employs actuators, or objects that avatars can interact with within the virtual environment.  Such objects preferably display interaction options when selected or otherwise triggered by the user (e.g. via a mouse over,
mouse click, or as the object enters the avatar's spheres (as described herein).  FIG. 13 displays an example of an actuator object.
<br/><br/> 2D and 3D Web Traffic--Shared Traffic Market
<br/><br/> Preferably locations within the virtual environment correspond to existing, traditional websites or web-pages on the World Wide Web and represent a traffic inlet for the virtual environment.  However, each virtual property may not have a
corresponding 2D website.
<br/><br/> Each property preferably has a file that contains a standard HTML script containing a unique hyperlink to the property in the virtual environment.  When a property is purchased, the file is provided (e.g. via email or another electronic
transmission) to the new owner.  The owner may then copy the script into the HTML source code of their standard 2D website(s).  When the 2D website is visited, the visitor may be given the option to view the site in 2D or 3D.  If the visitor selects 2D,
they will proceed to the 2D web site.  However, if the visitor selects 3D, they will preferably be redirected to the property in the virtual environment.  When a user originating from a corresponding 2D website is detected, the first view is preferably
of an aerial perspective that reveals the larger virtual environment and moves in to the property and finally to the view of a basic/generic avatar created for the user to navigate in the 3D environment.
<br/><br/> Additionally, script files are provided to owners for use on various social networks.  Such script files may enable users who have property in the virtual environment to offer visitors to their profiles on other social networks the option to
view their 3D property such as a store or personal virtual home.
<br/><br/> In the preferred embodiment, businesses will desire to purchase or rent property within the virtual environment that experiences a high degree of traffic.  For example, if two large retailers have stores located within the same "street" in the
virtual environment, users will be likely to move their avatars between the two stores.  Property between the two stores will be desirable because the users' avatars will pass by those properties while navigating between the two large retailers' stores. 
Such location based demand is similar to real world real estate.  More desirable properties may cost more to buy or rent.  In certain embodiments, the system is able to expand the number of properties thereby creating more properties in desirable
locations.  In other embodiments, the system may only add more properties at the edges of the virtual environment.
<br/><br/> The combined traffic of all inlets preferably creates visual flows of network traffic within the virtual environment that adds value to properties that are among or exposed to the traffic.  The combined "hits" of all of the properties in the
virtual environment are users visualized as avatars.  They are what populate virtual environment with visual traffic flows and add value to the virtual real estate.  This consolidation of web traffic from thousands of websites, now visualized as avatars
in an "open world environment," can move through the virtual environment from store to store.  Properties exposed to this traffic are attractive to businesses and increase in value.  Each new structure brings with it the traffic of its corresponding
standard 2D website which, in turn, increases the population density in that area, attracting new businesses, new structures, new traffic, more value, and so on, thereby creating a cycle of growth.
<br/><br/> Preferably, this "Shared Traffic Market" is a compounding and exponential growth model, essentially self populating; even at very low point of critical mass.  The shared traffic market is the combination of a virtual environment made up of
properties owned by businesses and individuals that enables direct links to those properties from corresponding web presences (existing 2D websites) of the businesses and individuals that own the properties, resulting in the effect of extending the
business' or individual's existing 2D web presence into the 3D open world environment.  The result is the redirection and consolidation of the web traffic of those web presences into the virtual environment.  The generation of graphical representations
(avatars) of each redirected user that users control to navigate through the virtual environment (open world environment) generates visual flows of traffic exposed to the virtual properties.
<br/><br/> The shared traffic market preferably generates more traffic than any one website would produce on its own.  The visible traffic flows through virtual streets and can be marketed to by businesses with window displays, signage, curb appeal and
other brick and mortar marketing techniques.  Properties can be priced and purchased based on traffic count.  Properties preferably have value that can be purchased and sold.  The concept enables the equivalent of purchasing a domain name that has a
steady flow of traffic to begin with.
<br/><br/> Heads Up Display (HUD)
<br/><br/> The HUD is preferably the user's personal and customizable 2D user interface for the user's applications.  Currently, on typical personal computing devices a desktop or home screen is a location for the user to place icons representing
applications, folders, files, and the like.  Typically, there is a desktop image background (i.e. wallpaper) that users can customize.  The wallpaper is a background layer and the icons are on a layer on top of the background.
<br/><br/> The HUD, on the other hand, is a translucent second display overlaid on the virtual environment that provides a location to place HUD tools and the user's applications.  These applications may enable the user to interact with files and folders
stored in storage space associated with the user's account, such as a property server, personal cloud storage, or other associated storage.  The applications may have been purchased by the user from an app store or may have otherwise been obtained and
stored in the storage space.  Some applications may be web applications that present information about the virtual environment to the user.  For example, a map HUD tool may show a user where they are in the virtual environment.  The applications may be
sourced on other servers and the user's storage space may contain metadata pertaining to the application and its location.
<br/><br/> The HUD preferably produces a desktop-like effect on the virtual environment or the VNE that moves with the user throughout the environment.  Preferably, the HUD is fixed in the user's field of view and moves with the user as they move
throughout the virtual environment.  Preferably there is no background.  Instead, the virtual environment is the "wallpaper." The HUD may also have control options that affect the HUD visually.
<br/><br/> The HUD experienced by a visitor or user of the virtual environment comprises the HUD, a variety of HUD tools (including, but not limited to, system menus, an applications store, a map, a compass, a communication and collaboration center, a
search and web-surfing tool, a help center, and a desktop viewer), and potentially a plurality of other applications that may have been obtained by the user from the app store or otherwise acquired.  Preferably, the system has speech recognition
capabilities and has input shortcuts for quicker control of HUD tools.
<br/><br/> As depicted in FIG. 6, the HUD is an interactive and translucent display layer superimposed on top of a user's current view of the virtual environment.  The HUD provides a location to place HUD tools that deliver access to a variety of
information and control options for the user.  Preferably, a user can decide which HUD tools are displayed and can customize their HUD display as desired.  In certain embodiments, at least one tool displayed on the HUD is fixed or set in position by the
system.  Furthermore, certain areas on the HUD may be reserved for displaying tools.
<br/><br/> HUD tools preferably allow a user to quickly access a variety of information and control options.  An embodiment of a HUD display is depicted in FIG. 7.  Preferably, HUD tools can be resized and positioned as desired by the user.  Additionally,
HUD tools may have brightness and opacity settings to alter the brightness and opacity of the HUD tools against the background of the 3D environment.  HUD tools preferably can be expanded, closed entirely, or minimized to take up a smaller portion of the
screen.
<br/><br/> One example of a HUD tool is a system menu, an embodiment of which is depicted in FIG. 8.  The system menu can be activated by selecting an icon in the HUD.  The system menu may include information, interactive settings, and controls for a
variety of system settings (e.g. audio, video, control, and graphic settings).  Additionally, the system menu may allow users to edit account information or profile settings, and review purchased items.
<br/><br/> Another example of HUD tools are maps and compasses.  FIGS. 14a and 14b display two embodiments of the virtual environment maps and compasses.  The map preferably shows a user their avatar's location within the virtual environment.  The map can
be a 2D aerial street view (as in FIG. 9a) or a 3D angled aerial view with terrain and buildings projecting from the street level (as in FIG. 9b).  Preferably, selecting a point on the map will teleport the avatar to the location selected.  The compass
preferably shows a user the direction their avatar is facing.  The map and compass may be positioned together or apart on the HUD.
<br/><br/> The HUD may also have a communications tool that provides a variety of communications features.  For example the communications tool may provide access to email, text, and/or voice and video calling.  Additionally, the system may provide access
to social media (e.g. Twitter or <b><i>Facebook</i></b>) for sharing a user's thoughts, photos, videos, links, files, and the like.  In other embodiments, the system itself is a social media site that would compete directly with other social media sites.  Social media
activities will take place within the virtual environment.  For example, users would login to the virtual environment to view messages, posts, images, etc. The communications tool will preferably be constantly updated as the user navigates the virtual
environment.  Additionally, if one avatar approaches another avatar, the users of the two avatars are preferably able to communicate directly using a device's microphone and speakers or via instant messaging.  Users are preferably able to exchange files. For example, one user could "give" a business card to another user.  This card would look like a real world business card and may be scripted to update the recipient's contact list with the new information.  Documents, files, and applications are
preferably transferable from one avatar to another.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the HUD may have a search and web surfing tool to allow a user to browse the internet in a traditional 2D interface.  Preferably, when a user views a 2D site in the 2D interface, the user can go directly to the corresponding 3D
site in the virtual environment.  Likewise, if a user opens the 2D interface while in a 3D site, the 2D version that corresponds to the 3D site will open in the HUD.
<br/><br/> The HUD may also allow users to access their desktop, for example as displayed in FIG. 10.  For example, users can select an icon, which activates a window within the HUD that displays the user's desktop.  Users can then, for example, drag items
(e.g. photos, videos, files, or applications) from their hard drive into the virtual environment.
<br/><br/> Other features that may be available to users may include, but are not limited to hotkeys (which can be set to perform specific functions), speech recognition (which provides voice control for tool and actions), and help tools.  Help tools may
include instructional videos, documents, tutorials, and/or workshops.  Workshops may include live instruction and collaboration with system employees or an independent business' employee.  Help topics may be browsable or searchable.
<br/><br/> Apps (Applications and Objects)
<br/><br/> In the preferred embodiment, users have access to an app store (or another database of applications) through the HUD (as displayed in FIG. 11), where user can browse and search for apps available to purchase.  While the term purchase is used,
apps may be free or have a specific cost.  The app store is preferably a marketplace for developers and users to sell and purchase apps, respectively.  The integration of applications and information into the virtual environment occurs as new apps are
developed, purchased, downloaded, and used.  The apps can be developed by individuals, developers, and/or businesses.  In certain embodiments, apps have to go through an approval process prior to becoming available in the app store.  In the store, apps
are preferably categorized and searchable.  In the app store, users can select an app to obtain more information about the app and decide whether or not to purchase the app. Users may be able to rent or try apps as well.  When a user clicks and drags an
item from the app store, the system preferably knows "who" wants to place "what" and "where" they want to place it.  The system can then generate the transaction and perform the desired function.
<br/><br/> Object apps are things that can be seen and have a three dimensional form such as a structure (e.g., a house, store, library, theater, etc.), or an item (e.g., virtual sofa, lamp, piece of art, tree, car, a football, etc.).  Examples of
structures include a store (which can sell virtual and/or real world products) or a house.  Functions, can be, apps that contain lines of script that allow avatars to jump, run, or do other actions in the virtual environment.  Applications are of three
types: service, functional, or utility.  A service app, for example, may be file storage or sharing services, payment services, and the like.  The system may also be able to run separate operating systems within the virtual environment.  For example, a
user accessing the virtual environment through a Windows based system may be able to purchase an application that runs a Mac operating system in the virtual environment (or vice versa).  Another example of a separate operating system running within the
virtual environment is a gaming system (e.g. Playstation, X-Box, or Wii), where users can play games, which only run on the proprietary gaming system, through the virtual environment.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the system may have functional applications.  For example, there may be a 3D virtual football, which, when in possession of an avatar, allows the avatar to run, throw, tackle, or other movements.  Another example of a function
application is a virtual phone, which may allow users in the virtual environment to call real-world phone numbers.  In another embodiment, the system may be able to allow users to view and interact with another computing device.  For example, a user
accessing the virtual environment on their computer may be able to access, use, and/or view programs or files on their tablet computer or smart-phone.
<br/><br/> A utility application is an application that assists a user or the system in accomplishing a certain task.  For example, a calculator HUD tool, a calendar, a spreadsheet, a dictionary, etc.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, specific applications will only be accessible or useable in specific locations within the virtual environment.  For example, a 3D modeling application may only be accessible in a modeling studio, a video playing
application may only be accessible in a virtual theater, or a game may only be accessible in a virtual arcade.
<br/><br/> The integration of the app store creates an environment where people and businesses can create and integrate applications, objects, and functions into the virtual environment.  Thus, integrating web traffic, websites, applications, and
information into a single collaborative, intuitive, and constantly evolving environment on the internet.
<br/><br/> Some objects may have their own interface or operating system separate from or within the operating system of the virtual environment (e.g. a windows based virtual computer).
<br/><br/> The collection of apps available in the store preferably populate the virtual environment with objects and provide additional functionality to the virtual environment, as displayed in FIG. 12.  Each icon preferably represents a file containing
metadata pertaining to the actual source file of the app which is preferably stored on a separate server from the app store database.  When an app is clicked and dragged onto a user's property, zone or HUD, the app's metadata is transferred to the
storage location pertaining to the desired location (i.e. where the HUD, zone or property data is located).  Apps can be, for example, 3D objects, structures, functions or scripts that have an effect on objects and zones, applications or collections of
scripts, objects that represent applications, objects that represent functions, structures with applications and functions as a package, or combinations thereof.
<br/><br/> Users
<br/><br/> In the preferred embodiment, anyone with access to the internet can become a visitor to the virtual environment.  However, in order to be able to fully interact with the virtual environment (e.g. buying and selling property, product, and
services), users (both individuals and businesses) are preferably required to set up an account with the system.  In setting up an account, users may be required to provide contact information, credit or debit card information, and other information. 
Such information will preferably be used for purchases within the virtual environment and for levels of access to the virtual environment.
<br/><br/> Additionally, users may be prompted to set up a profile.  The profile is preferably visible to other users, although users may be able to opt out of having their profiles be publicly visible.  In setting up a profile, a user may be able to
provide contact information, upload pictures, videos, and/or personal information (e.g. birthday, age, gender, tastes, and/or hobbies).  Furthermore, users may be able to link their accounts to social media accounts (e.g. Twitter or <b><i>Facebook</i></b>).  Moreover,
users can preferably customize their avatars.  An avatar's clothing, appearance (i.e. skin tone, hair color, or eye color), and other aspects may be able to be chosen by the user.  Certain customizations may only be available by purchase.  Profiles or
accounts may be linked with a dedicated amount of storage space.  The storage space may include a property server in which the user can store data and/or metadata pertaining to properties acquired in the virtual environment.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, the system may award users experience points and/or promote users to higher levels.  For example, when users accomplish tasks and/or use functions, the user can accumulate experience points in a variety of categories
and once a predetermined number of experience points are accumulated, the user can be promoted to a higher level.  Preferably, levels and experience points will be visible to other users.  Additionally, the system and/or other users may award trophies or
other awards upon completion of certain tasks.  For example a business may award a user a trophy for connecting the business with a customer.  Trophies may also be awarded based on votes from other users (e.g. for best structure or most creative avatar).
<br/><br/> Property
<br/><br/> As described herein, users may be able to purchase or rent (or otherwise control) land (or other portions of the virtual environment) within the virtual environment.  The system can encompass one or more pricing schemes to sell and/or rent
property.  A virtual environment comprised of consolidated traffic (shared traffic market model described herein) from a multitude of websites and visualized as avatars that move through the environment from business to business passing properties
produces a market of virtual properties which fluctuate in value based on exposure to traffic flow and further developments in the environment that attract users, i.e. points of interest or popular retailers.  A specific and market stabilizing pricing
model that is adaptive to market fluctuations is needed.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, the system tallies a property's exposure to traffic (i.e. a user who passed the store on the virtual street but did not enter the property) and calculates a fee based on the number of users exposed to the property. 
The system may then calculate the sum total of the amount of time spent by users in or on the property at a rate of Y per unit of time.  The system may then apply a "commission" or "fee" on completed sales as a percentage of total sales.  The system
preferably tallies each component fee into a single fee for each property resulting in pricing (which may be daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) that may be unique to each property and reflect the fluctuating value of the individual properties in the shared
traffic market, the flows of traffic in the virtual environment and the behavior of the users in it.  Additionally, this single pricing model of three separate components keeps pricing in balance with demand.
<br/><br/> When a user obtains property, the user can purchase pre-designed structures to place on the property, hire developers to create a structure, or create their own structure with proprietary developer tools.  Structures include stores, homes,
buildings, and the like.  When a user builds a store, for example, the user can present products for sale and interact with customers.  Additionally, employees of a business may place productivity applications in a private office within the store to
facilitate their online work.  For example, conference rooms may provide fully collaborative zones for employee meetings, private meetings with customers, or full presentations to a group.  In certain embodiments, the virtual properties can be purchased,
sold, rented, leased and traded between users, businesses, and/or other entities.
<br/><br/> In the preferred embodiment, when a property is obtained a suite or set of applications (for example, called a "Deed") pertaining to the property coordinates on the grid has also been obtained and is then stored in the user's property server. 
In the case of a rented property only access to the deed is available for the renter.  When a party sells a property to another party, preferably the deed is electronically removed from the seller's property server and transferred to the buyer's property
server.  The new owner of the property now has access to the deed and the seller can no longer access the deed.  The applications in the deed preferably enable the owner to effect change to that specific property and that property only.  For example, the
owner can place structures on the property, create and edit zones on the property, place objects on the property, store and/or associate applications and metadata pertaining to applications, store files, edit HUD displays that are viewable by visitors to
the property, and other changes that effect the property or the property visitors' experience.
<br/><br/> The deed and applications comprising the deed suite of applications preferably compile and maintain files, applications and other data and metadata resulting from the owner's property development activities and stores this data in a directory
pertaining to that property on the property server.  For example, when a user clicks and drags a virtual object from the app store, the object data or metadata (e.g. location of the source of the data) is filed in the directory associated with that
property.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment when a visiting user enters the property, the property server preferably receives the user data from the directory grid server.  The property server then routes that data to the appropriate deed on the property server. 
The deed by default routes the data to the property manager in the deed's directory.  Preferably, for each property that is purchased, a new deed is moved to the property server and the applications associated with the deed manage a new directory and
associated property
<br/><br/> When a deed (or property) is sold, in the preferred embodiment, the items and data in the directory can be sold with the deed or the seller can move items out of the directory to other properties before selling the property.  Additionally, the
seller can preferably store items on the property server that are not in a property directory for the occasion in which a seller wants to keep an object, application, or some other data but does not want it on another property yet.  In a preferred
embodiment, a directory can be "shared" with other users (e.g. in the case of a rented property).  In such situations, the owner of the property can select what is available to the tenant and what is locked or not viewable.
<br/><br/> A deed preferably contains the directory and sub-directories of data and metadata pertaining to the property.  It may also contain a property manager application that contains or accesses the portion of the grid that the property covers.  The
property manager maintains a directory which may be a sub-directory of the deed.  The property manager preferably receives routed data from the deed and routes data to appropriate items in the property manager's directory.  Items may be applications such
as a zone manager application with its own sub-directory of app metadata, etc.
<br/><br/> A deed may contain a deed card.  The deed card is preferably an application in the deed suite with an interface that can be displayed on the owner's HUD.  Deed cards may contain important analytics for the owner regarding the property.  For
example the deed card may display real time traffic count on the property, traffic count on the street that the property is connected to, demographics of the visitors, average time spent on the property, and other information concerning the property,
visitors, and the surrounding virtual environment.  Deed cards may also provide comparable property pricing based on averages of similar properties for sale.  The data on deed cards can preferably be selected to provide more detailed information and
interactive information.  For example, the owner may select the traffic count to present a graph that shows traffic count over specified time periods to reveal fluctuations in traffic based on periods of high traffic (e.g. "rush hour").  An owner may
rent property to other users or businesses.  In such situations, the deed cards may be shared with the occupant.
<br/><br/> Properties may be sold, rented, or otherwise exchanged with or without the structures, objects, and applications associated with the property.  By selling a property with a business on it and including the directory, turn key businesses, with
existing clients and supply chains included, may be sold.  Deed cards may also provide important information pertaining to a business on the property that is associated with the owner's account, such as historical sales, pending transactions, and the
like.  Deed cards may have a "sell" and/or "rent" button that can be clicked and later confirmed, which will post general property and/or business information to a searchable database available to users and businesses, who can search and browse for
properties to purchase or trade.  The searchable database may allow users to search by price, traffic count, proximity to a specific point in the environment, brand, demographic concentration, or other property attributes.  Property auctions may also be
possible where users bid to obtain properties.  Deeds for businesses may be associated with real world businesses and appropriate legal purchase agreements of the corresponding real world businesses.
<br/><br/> Homes
<br/><br/> When a user is authorized to develop a residentially zoned property, one of the structures that can be built is a house.  Purchasing a residential property is preferably the equivalent of purchasing a piece of a secured network.  The property
and the home on it are, for example, a graphical representation of the user's cloud computer (in the same way the user's avatar is a graphical representation of the user).  The residential property and home are preferably the personal property of the
owner, as is the objects and data in them.  However, in other embodiments, users rent the property and home from the system.  In rental properties, preferably, the objects and data may be still owned by the user.  Houses can store email, productivity
applications, social network data, and other personal functions, applications and activities.  Preferably, the owner of the property can decide who can enter the property and home.  In the preferred embodiment, the system maintains the data of each
user's house on a local server.
<br/><br/> In the preferred embodiment, users may be able to sell items from their houses.  For example, individuals can sell things through their "garage sale" store at their home.  Users can connect directly with the sellers via the communication tools
to discuss products.  A garage search will allow all users to see all available products that other users are selling (similar to online classified ads).  The system may require users to purchase commercial space once a predetermined threshold of sales
is met or a covenant is broken.
<br/><br/> Users can purchase pre-designed houses to place on the land, hire developers to create a house, or create their own house with proprietary developer tools.  Rooms and floors can preferably be added provided the dimensions of the house do not
exceed the dimensions of the property.  Additionally, once built, a house can be decorated with virtual art, music, furniture, or other decorative features.
<br/><br/> Developing a home using the app store to click and drag objects and applications into the home and property, gives the user their own "place in cyberspace," a familiar place to make their own and visit from anywhere in the world to access their
files &amp; apps.  It's their "home" on the web.
<br/><br/> The owner of a residential property and its associated storage space, such as its property server, may create and develop their properties in the same ways as other properties are developed in the environment (such as a store).  For example, the
owner of a residential property can create zones on the property and in the home and associate applications with those zones.
<br/><br/> Rooms are intuitive storage locations for the user's digital personal property such as their applications, files, folders and the like.  For example, a room in a home may be developed into an office by storing productivity related applications,
files and folders in that room.  That room and the applications, files, folders and objects in it may be stored in the property server as a sub-directory called "Office" in the directory "Home" which may exist under the property manager directory for
that property.  An object in that room, such a virtual 3D file cabinet may be stored as a sub-directory "File Cabinet" under the sub-directory "Office." "File Cabinet" may be a directory of the owner's folders and files in those folders.  Preferably,
when a user clicks and drags the file cabinet virtual object from the App Store into the office, the file name "File Cabinet" is added to the sub-directory "Office." Preferably when the user drags a file, which may have been created using an application
such as a word processor on the HUD, onto the file cabinet object in the virtual office the user may specify the name the file will be saved as.  This would save the file under the sub-directory "File Cabinet" because the user clicked and dragged the
file onto the file cabinet.
<br/><br/> Another example of a room may be one that is developed into a "Living Room." A user may develop a living room by storing objects and applications such as a virtual TV that connects with streaming video services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube,
or a bookshelf to store e-books.  These applications and objects, again, are organized in the directory system on the property server pertaining to that property.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment a user may, on their HUD, be able to interface in a familiar 2D manner with the files and folders in their storage space organized in their directory.  Additionally, a user may be able to see and interface with this 2D
directory while viewing the 3D virtual room and selecting an item in the directory, which may "highlight" the item, also selects the object in the environment and may "highlight" that object.  Similarly, selecting an object in the environment may
highlight the object and also highlight the associated item in the directory.
<br/><br/> The movement of files in the directory effects movement in the environment.  For example, if a user selects an item in the directory which may be the sub-directory "Bookshelf" under the sub-directory "Office" and moves the directory item to
sub-directory "Living Room" the virtual object in the environment would no longer be found in the office but would be found in the living room.  The user would then position the bookshelf in the living room as desired using the 3D interface as opposed to
the 2D directory interface on the HUD.  Similarly, an object moved in the virtual environment relocates that object accordingly on the property server.  (This type of organizing and interfacing preferably applies to all properties in the virtual
environment).
<br/><br/> Users may affect sharing settings for properties, structures, rooms, objects, applications, folders, files and documents.  These settings may allow public access, specific user access or only private access.  A room may be public.  A file
cabinet in the room may allow only the user's friends to access its contents while certain files in the cabinet may be for the owner's private access only.  In this way, a user may make the property and the living room in their home public while making
all other rooms private.  A user may add another user to a private room to allow them to enter.  For example, if the owner of the property has a child they may allow the child to access a child's room that stores the child's games, homework, objects,
movies, etc., while not providing the child access to specific private rooms such as an office where work and productivity related objects, applications and files are stored.  Additionally, rooms may have one or more closets which can be used to store
files and applications out of sight.
<br/><br/> Because the user's home exists in the visual network environment, it preferably becomes an immersive social media location where the user's friends, family, and colleagues can visit and interact with each other as well as interface with shared
applications, photos, videos, etc. Applications associated with zones in the home may allow collaborative activities such as white boarding in an office.  Multiple users can meet in an office to conduct collaborative activities.
<br/><br/> The user instance and the user's associated storage, comprised of their property server, personal cloud storage and any other associated storage represents a cloud computing capability for that user.  It is their cloud computer.  The home, rooms
and objects, as well as the HUD with its ability to interface with applications and documents and any integrated AVR that the owner has incorporated throughout their property, together are preferably the visual interface user for their cloud computer. 
The home is preferably the location where the user places objects acquired that represent any cloud based computing services or other web services acquired or subscribed to by the owner.  It's a place for the user to consolidate all of their digital
possessions in a private visual environment.
<br/><br/> Commerce
<br/><br/> To facilitate the purchase of apps, property, and real-world products, the system preferably accepts a variety of electronic payments on behalf of the users and stores.  Preferably, the system will act as a liaison between purchasers and
sellers, thereby allowing purchases without purchasers being required to enter their personal banking information for each transaction or purchase.  Preferably, when a buyer purchases a product, the item request and shipping information is electronically
sent to the seller and the system charges the buyer for the product and credits the seller's account.  FIG. 14 displays a flow chart of the purchasing process.
<br/><br/> Preferably, the system acts as a third party to all sales.  No merchants receive a user's private banking information.  Shopping in the environment is preferably safe and secure.  Users preferably don't have to enter payment and shipping
information every time they purchase a product.  Transaction facilitation is inherent throughout the virtual environment.  Users can preferably buy and sell both digital and real world products online without the hassle and expense of merchant software,
payment card processing, and PCI compliance.  Straight money transfers may also be able to be processed.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the online transaction process of crediting and debiting user accounts may enable more complex transactions.  For example, when a user purchases a product or service in the virtual environment, the purchasing user's account may be
charged and multiple accounts may be credited.
<br/><br/> A user or business with a real world product for sale may create, commission the creation of, or use a preexisting virtual likeness of the product in the form of a virtual object.  That virtual object may be priced and be associated with the
seller's account.  The object can be submitted to the app store or can be placed in the virtual environment upon property owned or occupied by the seller.  When a user approaches the object, associated AVR may provide a purchase option for the user. 
When a user selects "purchase" the online transaction process performs the transaction and supplies the seller with shipping information for the real world product.
<br/><br/> Virtual objects that may represent a real world product and may be found throughout the virtual environment and/or in an associated digital marketplace or the app store may also represent an associated supply chain.  The virtual object
representing the real world product may be proliferated to other virtual retailers throughout the virtual environment via the app store.  A second business may click and drag the virtual object, representing the real world product, from the app store
into their virtual structure for their visitors to see and purchase.  This second business may associate the product with their account and re-price the object as they desire.  When a user purchases the product from this second store the purchaser's
account is charged the new price and the "purchase" is forwarded to the seller who has the actual real world product, crediting their account and providing shipping information to complete the sale.  The difference in cost from the original seller and
the new cost from the second seller is credited or debited to the second seller's account.  (It is assumed that the second seller would re-price to accommodate a profit.)
<br/><br/> The owner of a virtual object that represents a product may edit values of the product to apply commissions on the sale of the product.  For example, a user or business selling a product in hopes of proliferating the object as a purchase point
throughout the virtual environment, may offer a 10% commission on the sale of the product when purchased via the virtual object.  Thus incentive can be added for stores throughout the virtual environment to place the virtual object in their stores.  This
allows businesses to click and drag virtual objects that represent the supply chain of the seller of the physical product.
<br/><br/> A user may create an event to trigger a purchase of real world products that are sold in the environment.  For example, a bulk order of one hundred units of a product, i.e. 100 digital cameras.  That user may create a virtual object representing
one digital camera for sale.  The user may place this virtual object representing the digital camera in a virtual store.  Other users, who may understand, for example via AVR information associated with the virtual object, that a purchase of one or more
units allows them to participate in the bulk order, may select "purchase." The original user may have set the purchase event to trigger the bulk order when a predetermined number of units have been sold.  When triggered the system will preferably charge
and credit all appropriate accounts and provide shipping information to appropriate parties.
<br/><br/> Individuals and businesses may be able to use a Universal Product Code (UPC) scanner to scan product codes or manually enter the numerical codes with a keyboard of real world products.  A subsystem may receive this input, accesses the national
UPC system to pull product information and accesses the app store database to pull corresponding 3D objects.  Both the product information and 3D object are preferably delivered to the individual or businesses for the purpose of populating virtual stores
with 3D objects that represent the real world products for sale or for the general population of the virtual environment with objects, decor, etc. Additionally, the product information may be used to attach information to the object using an AVR/AR
editor that may be an application in the deed suite of applications.
<br/><br/> Once the objects are placed, the owner of the property can select the object in the virtual environment.  Any information associated with the UPC by the manufacturer of the product, such as product specifications and descriptions, would then be
displayed as AVR in the environment.  The owner may be able to format this information and add, subtract and change information as needed to create the experience they desire for their visitors.  These changes can be stylistic to create a visual
experience.  They can also include links, pricing, purchase options etc.
<br/><br/> A person can put an item on layaway for a set period of time at which point the system will force the purchase.  During that period, all individuals and/or stores in the virtual environment who are selling that product can elect to be notified
that an anonymous user has put that product on layaway at a certain price and the sellers will have the opportunity to beat the price for the purchasing user.  The purchasing user can accept the new bid and complete the transaction, which would cancel
the original offer, or accept the new bid as a layaway repeating the process.  Likewise, the seller may sell the product to another user who is willing to pay the original price while the buyer is waiting for lower bids.  The process preferably ends when
the purchasing user completes a purchase from a new seller or the purchase is forced due to no new bids.
<br/><br/> Development Tools
<br/><br/> The objects, functions, and applications available to users are creatable by users and developers.  The system preferably offers a virtual research and development complex for users to create and test applications, objects, and functions.  The
system will provide users with a variety of development tools.  Users may be able to send requests to the system for new applications, objects, and/or functions that another user may attempt to develop.  Requests may be rated by other users to give
developers a sense of what the market wants.  Preferably the system will have an open source code to facilitate development of new applications, objects, and functions.
<br/><br/> Users are able to create 3D object files in a virtual development studio through the system's 3D modeling and rendering software.  Preferably, once a user has created an object, the user is able to drag the object from the studio into a database
of files via the HUD.  Once in the database, files may be named and provided with a description.  Additionally, files may be private (password protected) or public (available to all users).  Additionally, users may be able to package objects to be sold
in the app store.  Preferably users can use a virtual facility to develop and test, for example, an object's physics, collision detection and response, sound, scripting, animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management,
treading, localization support, and/or scene graph.
<br/><br/> Other development tools include, but are not limited to floor planning and architectural tools, terrain and landscaping tools, 3D imaging tools, software creation tools, HUD development tools, and game creation tools.
<br/><br/> In the preferred embodiment, the system is capable of converting or translating a traditional 2D website into a 3D virtual structure.  Preferably, the system is able to parse the 2D website's HTML code, extract necessary components, and create
and/or locate a corresponding 3D object to populate the 3D virtual structure with.  For example, if the owner of a 2D website selling products desires to convert the 2D website into a 3D virtual store, the system may parse the HTML of the 2D website,
determine what products are for sale, replace 2D images with 3D renderings of the products and position them in the virtual structure, extract the associated text for each product, and display the text within the 3D virtual store adjacent to the 3D
rendered product.  The 3D renderings of products may be stored in a general database of 3D renderings, be provided by the 2D website's owner, or be generated from 2D images by the system.
<br/><br/> In the preferred embodiment, the deed suite of applications contains applications users can interface with via their HUD that provide a variety of property development and other development tools.
