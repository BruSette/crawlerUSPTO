<br/><br/> The present disclosure relates generally to a user comment system and, more particularly, to synchronization and moderation of user comments.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system.  The social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a user profile, in
connection with the user.  The user profile may include a user's demographic information, communication channel information, and personal interest.  The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user's relationship with other users
in the social networking system (e.g., social graph), as well as provide services (e.g., wall-posts, photo-sharing, or instant messaging) to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system.
<br/><br/> Users of a web site may post comments to contents of the web site.  The web site may store user comments as well as moderate user comments such as deleting user comments determined to be irrelevant or inappropriate.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments relate to a user comment system that assigns one or more privacy settings to a user comment associated with a content object hosted by a third party system, and stores the user comment in a data store of user comments in
association with an identifier for the content object.  These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures. <br/><br/>BRIEF

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The invention is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.  In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding
of the present disclosure.  It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details.  In other instances, well known process steps and/or structures have not been
described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure.  In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the
disclosure to the described embodiments.  To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.
<br/><br/> A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it, and with each other through, the system.  Typically, to become a registered user of a social networking system, an entity, either human or
non-human, registers for an account with the social networking system.  Thereafter, the registered user may log into the social networking system via an account by providing, for example, a correct login ID or username and password.  As used herein, a
"user" may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.
<br/><br/> When a user registers for an account with a social networking system, the social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a "user profile", in connection with the user.  The user profile may include information
provided by the user and information gathered by various systems, including the social networking system, relating to activities or actions of the user.  For example, the user may provide his name, profile picture, contact information, birth date,
gender, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, and other demographical information to be included in his user profile.  The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user
considers to be his friends.  A list of the user's friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user's profile.  Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction.  For example, if Bob and Joe
are both users and connect with each another, Bob and Joe are each connections of the other.  If, on the other hand, Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam's posted content items, but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob, a one-way connection may be
formed where Sam is Bob's connection, but Bob is not Sam's connection.  Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections (e.g., friends of friends).  Connections may be added
explicitly by a user, for example, the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend, or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users (e.g., users who are alumni of the same educational
institution).  The user may identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user's profile.
<br/><br/> The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user (such as contact information and interests) at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time.  The user may also update his or her profile information at
any time.  For example, when the user moves, or changes a phone number, he may update his contact information.  Additionally, the user's interests may change as time passes, and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time.  A
user's activities on the social networking system, such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system, may also provide information that may be included in the user's profile.  Again, such information may be updated from time to time to
reflect the user's most-recent activities.  Still further, other users or so-called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user's profile.  For example, a contact may add the user as a friend (or
remove the user as a friend).  A contact may also write messages to the user's profile pages--typically known as wall-posts.  A user may also input status messages that get posted to the user's profile page.
<br/><br/> A social network system may maintain social graph information, which can generally model the relationships among groups of individuals, and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds.  A social network
may be represented using a graph structure.  Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network.  Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users.  In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is
defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other.  A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.
<br/><br/> A social networking system may support a variety of applications, such as photo sharing, on-line calendars and events.  For example, the social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities.  For example, the social networking
system may allow users to post photographs and other multimedia files to a user's profile, such as in a wall post or in a photo album, both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system.  Social networking system may also
allow users to configure events.  For example, a first user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event, location of the event and other users invited to the event.  The invited users may receive invitations to the event
and respond (such as by accepting the invitation or declining it).  Furthermore, social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar.  Similarly to events, the calendar entries may include times, dates, locations and identities of
other users.
<br/><br/> The social networking system may also support a privacy model.  A user may or may not wish to share his information with other users or third-party applications, or a user may wish to share his information only with specific users or third-party
applications.  A user may control whether his information is shared with other users or third-party applications through privacy settings associated with his user profile.  For example, a user may select a privacy setting for each user datum associated
with the user and/or select settings that apply globally or to categories or types of user profile information.  A privacy setting defines, or identifies, the set of entities (e.g., other users, connections of the user, friends of friends, or third party
application) that may have access to the user datum.  The privacy setting may be specified on various levels of granularity, such as by specifying particular entities in the social network (e.g., other users), predefined groups of the user's connections,
a particular type of connections, all of the user's connections, all first-degree connections of the user's connections, the entire social network, or even the entire Internet (e.g., to make the posted content item index-able and searchable on the
Internet).  A user may choose a default privacy setting for all user data that is to be posted.  Additionally, a user may specifically exclude certain entities from viewing a user datum or a particular type of user data.
<br/><br/> A social networking system may support a news feed service.  A news feed is a data format typically used for providing users with frequently updated content.  A social networking system may provide various news feeds to its users, where each
news feed includes content relating to a specific subject matter or topic, and/or other users.  Various pieces of content may be aggregated into a single news feed.  In some implementations, a social networking system may provide a news feed that
includes selected entries corresponding to activities of a user's first-degree contacts and/or pages or topics that a user has indicated an interest.  Individual users of the social networking system may subscribe to specific news fees of their interest. U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,669,123, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes, describes a system that can be used to dynamically provide a news feed.  A group of related actions may be presented together to a user of the social networking system
in the same news feed.  For example, a news feed concerning the event organized through the social networking system may include information about the event, such as its time, location, and attendees, and photos taken at the event, which have been
uploaded to the social networking system.  U.S.  application Ser.  No. 12/884,010, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes, describes a system that can be used to construct a news feed comprising related actions and present the news
feed to a user of the social networking system.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example social networking system.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store user profile data and social graph information in user profile database 101.  In particular embodiments, the social
networking system may store user event data in event database 102.  For example, a user may register a new event by accessing a client application to define an event name, a time and a location, and cause the newly created event to be stored in event
database 102.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store user privacy policy data in privacy policy database 103.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store media data (e.g., photos, or video clips) in
media database 104.  In particular embodiments, databases 101, 102, 103, and 104 may be operably connected to the social networking system's front end 120 and news feed engine 110.  In particular embodiments, the front end 120 may interact with client
device 122 through network cloud 121.  Client device 122 is generally a computer or computing device including functionality for communicating (e.g., remotely) over a computer network.  Client device 122 may be a desktop computer, laptop computer,
personal digital assistant (PDA), in- or out-of-car navigation system, smart phone or other cellular or mobile phone, or mobile gaming device, among other suitable computing devices.  Client device 122 may execute one or more client applications, such as
a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera, etc.) or special-purpose client application (e.g., <b><i>Facebook</i></b> for iPhone, etc.), to access and view content over a computer network.  Front
end 120 may include web or HTTP server functionality, as well as other functionality, to allow users to access the social networking system.  Network cloud 121 generally represents a network or collection of networks (such as the Internet or a corporate
intranet, or a combination of both) over which client devices 122 may access the social network system.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a user of the social networking system may upload one or more media files to media database 104.  For example, a user can upload a photo or a set of photos (often called a photo album), or a video clip to media
database 105 from a client device 122 (e.g., a computer, or a camera phone).  In particular embodiments, the one or more media files may contain metadata (often called "tags") associated with each media file.  For example, a photo shot by a digital
camera may contain metadata relating to file size, resolution, time stamp, name of the camera maker, and/or location (e.g., GPS) coordinates.  A user can add additional metadata values to a photo, or tag a photo, during an upload process.  Some examples
of tags of a media file are author, title, comments, event names, time, location, names of people appearing in the media file, or user comment.  In particular embodiments, a user may tag a media file by using a client application (e.g., a photo or video
editor), or entering one or more tags in a graphical user interface of a media uploading tool that uploads a user's one or more media files from a client device 122 to the social networking system.  A user may also tag a media file after an upload at a
later time in the social networking system's web site.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may also extract metadata from a media file and store the metadata in media database 104.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, news feed engine 110 may access user profile database 101, event database 102, and media database 104 for data about a particular user of the social networking system, and assemble a list of one or more activities as
news items for a user or a set of users.  In particular embodiments, news feed engine 110 may access privacy policy database 103 and determines a subset of news items based on one or more privacy settings.  In particular embodiments, news feed engine 110
may compile a dynamic list of a limited number of news items in a ranked or sorted order.  In particular embodiments, news feed engine 110 may provide links related to one or more activities in the news items, and links providing opportunities to
participate in the activities.  For example, a news feed can comprise wall posts, status updates, comments, and recent check-ins to a place (with a link to a web page of the place).
<br/><br/> In other embodiments, news feed engine 110 may access user profile database 101, event database 102, and media database 104 and compile a dynamic list of a limited number of news items about a group of related actions received from users of the
social networking system (i.e., a news feed).  For example, a news feed can comprise an event that a user may schedule and organize through the social networking system (with a link to participate the event), messages about the event posted by the user
and other participants of the event, and photos of the event uploaded by the user and other participants of the event.
<br/><br/> Users of a social networking system can access other websites or third party websites (e.g., ESPN.com, www.youtube.com).  In particular embodiments, a user using client device 122 may connect to and communicate with third party website 130
through network cloud 121.  Third party website 130 may comprise web server 131 operatively connected to one or more data stores 132 storing user data and web page information.  User data may include, for example, user name, user profile picture, and
user profile information (e.g., location, affiliation, interest).  Web page information may include, for example, page layout information, scripts, web page content such as text (e.g., ASCII or HTML), media data (e.g., graphics, photos, video clips), and
executable code objects (e.g., a game executable within a browser window or frame).  In particular embodiments, a user may use a web browser or special-purpose client application hosted on client device 122 to access their party website 130 by sending an
HTTP request to web server 131, causing web server 131 to access the one or more data stores 132 and construct one or more web pages or frames displayed in the web browser or the special-purpose client application.
<br/><br/> A social networking system may communicate and access third party website 130, and vise versa, through network cloud 121.  For example, a web page constructed by third party website 130 for a user of a social networking system can contain
information from the social networking system, such as a frame displaying profile pictures of the user's first-degree friends who are currently active on third party website 130.  For example, a user's user profile page of a social networking system can
contain an embedded video clip that the user posted on third party website 130.  In some embodiments, a web page constructed by a first web site may include one or more inline references that cause the client device 122 to access and display content from
a second website by incorporating in the web page's HTML document Uniform Resource Locations (URLs) and/or script code (e.g., JavaScript, PHP, AJAX) that causes a client application hosted on the client device 122 to access the second website to
dynamically provide content specified by the script code (e.g., profile pictures).  In some embodiments, a browser cookie installed by a second website on client device 122 can be used to facilitate accessing the second website.  For example, requests
transmitted to the social networking system for a particular user may include a browser cookie or other token to enable automatic authentication and access to the social networking system for the particular user (e.g., to access and display profile
pictures of the particular user's first-degree friends), without the particular user having to manually enter user ID and password information of the social networking system.
<br/><br/> Individuals viewing a web page containing particular web content (e.g., an article, a blog post, a photo, a video clip, etc.) can post one or more comments about the particular content on the web page.  FIG. 2 illustrates an example web page of
an article and associated comments.  In the example of FIG. 2, the web page displays comments 201 and 202 about an article (a blog) 200, and in-line comments 203 and 204 responding to comment 201.  A viewer of the web page can add a new comment in
comment box 210 and select post comment icon 211 to submit the new comment, causing all or part of the web page to refresh and update with the new comment by the viewer.  Ordinarily, third party website 130 stores comments in the one or more data stores
132, and displays comments in chronological order (e.g., most recent is displayed first) in a web page.  However, comments on the top of the list in a web page may not be most relevant to a viewer of the web page.  Particular embodiments herein describe
methods in that a social networking system hosts a user comment system for a third party website, and presents user comments to a first user based on the first user's social graph information and, in some instances, one or more privacy settings. 
Particular embodiments herein can be implemented by a comment hosting process hosted by one or more computing devices of the social networking system.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a user comment may be a comment associated with particular web content in a web page constructed by third party website 130.  For example, a comment associated with an article can be a comment made by a first person to
the article, and can be a comment made by a second person to the article, and can be a comment made by a third person to the comment made by the first person to the article.  In particular embodiments, a user comment may comprise content information and
author information.  For example, content information can be content of the comment (e.g., a text string) and a time stamp.  Author information can be a name of the author of the user comment (e.g., a user name, a screen name, etc.) and a profile picture
of the author.  In some instances, if an author of a user comment prefers to remain anonymous, or information about the author is not available, a default name (e.g. "anonymous user") and a default profile picture may be assigned to the user comment.  In
particular embodiments, a user comment may further comprise review information.  For example, review information can be how many up or down votes the user comment has received from viewers of the user comment.  For example, review information can be how
many "like" counts the user comment had received from viewers of the user comment.  For example, review information can also include the author's reputation score derived from votes, likes or other feedback received by other users across a set of
comments (e.g., an author can be a popular commentator if he has received positive reviews in ten other comments he made).  In particular embodiments, a user comment may further comprise or be associated with one or more privacy settings.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the comment hosting process may store one or more user comments associated with the particular web content in comment database 105 illustrated in FIG. 1.  In particular embodiments, comment database 105 may be operably
connected to system front end 120, and news feed engine 110.  In particular embodiments, the comment hosting process may store and access user comments based on a common thread comprising one or more user comments associated with the same web content. 
In some embodiments, the comment hosting process may store and access user comments based on a unique thread identifier.  For example, a thread identifier can be a combination of URL address of third party website 130 and a web content identifier for the
particular web content.  FIG. 3 illustrates an example data structure of user comments stored in a comment data store.  In the example of FIG. 3, user comments to a web content "article_1234" at web site "www.example.com" are programming objects linked
to a common thread identifier "www.example.com/article_1234" (320), and each programming object can comprise content information (e.g., a text string, a time stamp), author information (e.g., a name, a user profile picture thumbnail), review information
(e.g., up/down vote count), and/or one or more privacy settings.  Another example data structure of user comments stored in a comment data store can be each comment object containing a thread identifier field 330 as illustrated in FIG. 3A.  In such an
implementation, the comment hosting process can store and access the comment objects based on a value of the thread identifier field.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the comment hosting process may add/adjust one or more privacy settings of a user comment stored in comment database 105 based on the user comment author's privacy settings stored in user profile database 101.  For
example, a first user can configure and store in user profile database 101 a particular privacy setting for his comments on any web content of third party website 130 as only viewable to his first- and second-degree friends.  The comment hosting process
can add the particular privacy setting to a user comment made by the first user at third party website 130 when storing the user comment in comment database 105.  In other embodiments, the comment hosting process may apply a default privacy setting to a
user comment that is global to social networking system, e.g., viewable to everyone.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, web server 131 of third party website 130 may include in structured documents transmitted to client applications HTML or other code objects that cause the client applications to transmit requests to the comment hosting
process for user comments associated with the particular web content.  The request causes the comment hosting process to access comment database 105 and provide the requested user comments.  For example, web server 131 may construct a web page containing
the particular web content and the requested user comments associated with the particular web content.  In some embodiments, web server 131 may construct a web page of the particular web content (e.g., an article, a photo, or a video clip), including an
inline frame for user comments associated with the particular web content by using an HTML iframe tag referencing social networking system and a unique identifier for the particular web content or comment thread.  FIG. 4 illustrates an example web page
using an inline frame for user comments.  In the example of FIG. 4, web server 131 of website "www.example.com" constructs a web page 400 in HTML of an article about a college football game (401), including an inline frame 402 using a HTML iframe tag
referencing the social networking system and a unique identifier for the article www.example.com/article_1234, such as:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 &lt;iframe src="http://www.facebook.com/comment.php?href=http://www.example.com/artic- le_1234 width="600px"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;
<br/><br/> The foregoing iframe element causes a client application hosted on a client device 122 to transmit a request causing the comment hosting process to access comment database 105 based on the unique identifier.  The comment hosting process provides
a response including user comments associated with the article to be displayed in the inline frame.  In some implementations, the response also includes Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) code, or alternatively a combination of JavaScript and
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) code, that allows users to post comments, either new comments and/or in-line replies to existing comments.  For example, an individual can add an additional comment by entering a text string in comment box 420 and
selecting Add Comment icon 421.  The AJAX or JSON code of the inline frame transmits a message to social networking system, causing comment hosting process to store the additional comment in comment database 105 and refresh content in inline frame 402 to
include the additional comment.  In some implementations, the user viewing the content and submitting comments can be identified based on browser cookies including a user identifier that are appended to various requests transmitted to social networking
system.  As discussed below, the comment hosting process, when receiving a comment, may also configure a news feed item for processing by news feed engine 110.  Still further, the comment entry interface may also allow a user to configure a privacy
setting for that particular comment or all comments of the user associated with the particular web content.  For example, the user may specify that only a custom set of users can access the content, or that only those users having a first degree
relationship can see the comment whether in a news feed item or displayed in connection with the third party web site.  If no particular privacy setting is configured, the comment hosting process may apply a default setting that is global to social
networking system or a default specified by the user and stored with the user's profile information.
<br/><br/> Additionally, a user's comment about the particular web content at third party website 130 may appear in the user's news feed in the social networking system, or in a news feed of a friend of the user in the social networking system.  The news
feed object may include a short snippet of the particular content, a thumbnail image, and a hypertext link to the particular content hosted by third party website 210.  In addition, comments to the news feed at the social networking system about the
particular web content and comments to the particular web content at third party website 130 may be synchronized since the comments are stored in the same comment database 105.  In some instances, the comments are stored based on the same unique thread
identifier as described above.  In particular embodiments, news feed engine 110 may access comment database 105 to include in a news feed one or more comments made by the first user, or by a first-degree friend of the first user, about the particular web
content at third party websites 130.  In particular embodiments, the first user or a second user, when viewing the comments thread from a news feed, may add one or more additional comments about the particular web content by adding the additional
comments to the news feed item, causing news feed engine 110 to store the additional comments about the particular web content in comment database 105.  In particular embodiments, news feed engine 110 may access comment database 105 and include the
additional comments about the particular web content in the news feed.  In particular embodiments, web server 131 may construct a web page containing the particular web content and associated user comments, causing the comment hosting process to access
comment database 105 for user comments associated with the particular web content, including the additional comments made by the first user or the second user to the news feed item.  Accordingly, the comment thread for a particular web content item may
include comments entered in connection with the third party web site and the social networking system.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 4A, 4B, and 4C, in addition to FIG. 4, illustrate example synchronizations of user comments between the social networking system and a third party website.  For example in FIG. 4, a first user "user2" posts comment 403 to an article about
a college football game (401) in a third party website "www.example.com", causing the comment hosting process to store comment 403 in comment database 105.  News feed engine 110 can access comment database 105 to include comment 403 and information about
the article (e.g., title and web site of the article) in the first user's news feed, as illustrated in FIG. 4A.  For example, a second user can add a comment to the article by typing in his comment in comment box 410 and selecting a submit icon 411
("Post comment to www.example.com") in the news feed (e.g., on the first user's user profile page), causing news feed engine 110 to store the second user's comment in comment database 105, and display the second user's comment (404) in the news feed, as
illustrated in FIG. 4B.  Web server 131 may refresh the web page in FIG. 4, causing the comment hosting process to access comment database 105 and updating the user comment inline frame 402 including the second user's comment 404, as illustrated in FIG.
4C.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments described above on synchronization of user comments associated with a same web content may not be limited to the social networking system and a third party website.  Two or more websites may share particular web content,
for example, multiple newspapers can share a news article provided by a news service agency (e.g., Reuters).  In particular embodiments, two or more websites may synchronize user comments for a particular web content by storing and accessing user
comments for the particular web content in comment database 105 using the same comment identifier.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates an example method of ordering user comments based on social graph information and privacy settings.  The ordering process may be initiated when a request for comments including a comment thread identifier is received by the
comment hosting process.  In particular embodiments, the comment hosting process may receive a user comment event for the particular web content (501).  For example, a user comment event can be a user request for comments associated with a particular
content of third party website 131.  Another user comment event can be that news feed engine 110 constructs a news feed of a particular user, including user comments on the particular web content by the particular user and other users.  For example, a
user comment event can be that a new user comment about the particular web content is submitted at the web page containing the particular web content and/or existing user comments associated with the particular web content.  In particular embodiments,
the comment hosting process may access comment database 105 for user comments associated with the particular web content (502).
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the comment hosting process may generate a list of user comments weighted by recency (503).  For example, the comment hosting process can generate the list of user comments from all user comments associated with the
particular web content, and place the comments in the list in chronological order (e.g., most recent first).  In particular embodiments, the comment hosting process may adjust the list of user comments based on social graph information of a first user
associated with the request (504).  As discussed above, the first user may be identified in a browser cookie appended to the request.  In particular embodiments, the comment hosting process may access user profile database 101 and adjust the order of the
list of user comments based on social graph information of the first user.  For example, the comment hosting process can place comments from the first user's first-degree friends at the beginning of the list of user comments.  In particular embodiments,
the comment hosting process may further adjust the order of the list of user comments based on user attributes (e.g., locality, trustworthiness, affiliation) and comment attributes (e.g. voting reputation).  In some embodiments, the comment hosting
process may assign a weighting score to each of the user comments in the list of user comments based on social graph information, user attributes and comment attributes.  For example, the comment hosting process can assign a weighting score of 1.0 to
comments made by the first user's first-degree friends.  The comment hosting process can assign a weighting score of 0.5 to comments made by users in the same neighborhood (i.e., Sunset District, San Francisco, Calif.) as the first user.  For example,
the comment hosting process can assign a weighting score of 0.8 to comments made by users with the same affiliation as the first user or close affinity to the first user (e.g., went to the same collage during the same school year).  A system for
measuring user affinity is described more generally in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 11/503,093, filed on Aug.  11, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.  For example, the comment hosting process can
assign a weighting score of 0.7 to comments made by users having a high level of trustworthiness or a reputation score above a threshold.  An example process of determining the level of trustworthiness of a user based on user actions is described more
generally in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 11/701,744 filed on Feb.  2, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.  The comment hosting process can assign a weighting score of 0.8 to comments with positive
voting reputation (e.g., more up votes than down votes).  For example, the comment hosting process can assign a default weighting score (e.g., 0.2) to rest of the comments in the list of user comments.  In some embodiments, the comment hosting process
may adjust the order of the list of user comments based on the weighting score of each comment, for example, ranking comments with higher weighting scores ahead of comments with lower weighting scores.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the comment hosting process may adjust the list of user comments based on one or more privacy settings (505).  For example, the comment hosting process may access user profile database 101, determine one or more
privacy settings for each comment of the list of user comment (e.g., as set by each comment's author), identify one or more comments that the first user does not have permission to access based on the privacy settings of the commenting users, and remove
the one or more identified comments from the list of user comments.  As discussed above, one or more of the comments may include privacy settings specifically configured for the user comment.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the comment hosting process may present the adjusted list of user comments to the first user (506).  For example, the comment hosting process can present the adjusted list of user comments to the first user accessing a
web page containing the particular web content by displaying the adjusted list of user comments in an inline frame.  For example, the comment hosting process can present the adjusted list of user comments to the first user accessing a web page containing
a news feed by passing the adjusted list of user comments to news feed engine 110 to be included in the news feed.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, an administrator of third party website 130 or the social networking system may moderate comments.  In one implementation, the comment hosting process may allow administrator access to comment threads associated with a
third party web site.  In some implementations, the comment thread identifiers may also include, or be associated with, information identifying a web domain.  The social networking system may allow administrators associated with a given web domain to
access comment threads associated with the web domain.  For example, a third party website administrator may modify one or more privacy settings of a user comment in comment database 105.  In particular embodiments, an administrator of third party
website 130 or the social networking system may moderate user comments of a particular web content of third party website 130 by modifying privacy settings of user comments of the particular web content.  In this manner, a third party administrator may
be able to individually control which comments can be accessed by users generally as opposed to a more limited set of users.  In some embodiments, the administrator may delete a particular user comment from public view by modifying the privacy setting of
the particular user comment as only viewable to first-degree friends of the author of the particular user comment.  In other embodiments, the administrator may delete a particular user comment from public view by modifying the privacy setting of the
particular user comment as only accessible to the administrator.  In particular embodiments, the administrator can black list a particular user by modifying privacy settings of every user comments by the particular user as only accessible to the
particular user.  In some implementations, comments submitted by a first user may by default be viewable only by first degree friends of the first user until a third party web site administrator has had a chance to review the comment and make the comment
accessible to all users.  In this manner, comments which may not be appropriate for a more public or general audience can nevertheless be made available to first degree friends of the user.  In other implementations, comments by default may be accessible
to everyone.  An administrator may change the privacy setting of the user comment to be viewable only by the commenting user or the first degree friends of the user.
