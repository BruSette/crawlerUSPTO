<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Example methods and systems to provide a personal shopping experience are described.  In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example
embodiments.  It will be evident however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.
<br/><br/> When a consumer shops at a mall, the consumer may access a mall kiosk and indicate a category of items of interest to the consumer.  In response, the mall kiosk may present a list of mall items located in the mall to the consumer.  The list of
items may also be categorized into various categories.  At the mall kiosk, the shopper may make a selection of items from the list of items.  Once the selection is made, the mall kiosk may present to the shopper a diagram of the mall.  The diagram may
include a path from one item selected by the user to another item selected by the user.  The mall kiosk may also provide to the shopper discounts for the items selected by the shopper.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, the shopper may interact with the mall kiosk using a mobile device.  The shopper may indicate an item preference using the mobile device.  The mall kiosk may also provide the discounts to the mobile device of the shopper. In various embodiments, the mall kiosk may display a promotional code to the shopper to be used at a store within the mall.  In various embodiments, the mall kiosk may send a coupon to a store within the mall to be redeemed by the shopper.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a network diagram depicting a client-server system 100, within which one example embodiment may be deployed.  A networked system 102, in the example forms of a network-based marketplace or publication system, provides server-side
functionality, via a network 104 (e.g., the Internet or Wide Area Network (WAN)) to one or more clients.  FIG. 1 illustrates, for example, a programmatic client 108 executing on client machine 112.  FIG. 1 also illustrates, for example, a shopping
experience kiosk 110 in communication with the network 104.  The shopping experience kiosk 110 may be a mall kiosk that exists within a shopping area and provides a shopper with a personalized shopping experience.  The shopping experience kiosk 110 may
comprise a display that presents information to the shopper.  The shopper may also interact with the shopping experience kiosk 110 via the display.
<br/><br/> An Application Program Interface (API) server 114 and a web server 116 are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers 118.  The application servers 118 host one or more marketplace
applications 120 and payment applications 122.  The application servers 118 are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more databases servers 124 that facilitate access to one or more databases 126.
<br/><br/> The marketplace applications 120 may provide a number of marketplace functions and services to users that access the networked system 102.  The payment applications 122 may likewise provide a number of payment services and functions to users. 
The payment applications 122 may allow users to accumulate value (e.g., in a commercial currency, such as the U.S.  dollar, or a proprietary currency, such as "points") in accounts, and then later to redeem the accumulated value for products (e.g., goods
or services) that are made available via the marketplace applications 120.  While the marketplace and payment applications 120 and 122 are shown in FIG. 1 to both form part of the networked system 102, it will be appreciated that, in alternative
embodiments, the payment applications 122 may form part of a payment service that is separate and distinct from the networked system 102.
<br/><br/> Further, while the system 100 shows in FIG. 1 employs a client-server architecture, the present invention is of course not limited to such an architecture, and could equally well find application in a distributed, or peer-to-peer, architecture
system, for example.  The various marketplace and payment applications 120 and 122 could also be implemented as standalone software programs, which do not necessarily have networking capabilities.
<br/><br/> The web client 106 accesses the various marketplace and payment applications 120 and 122 via the web interface supported by the web server 116.  Similarly, the programmatic client 108 accesses the various services and functions provided by the
marketplace and payment applications 120 and 122 via the programmatic interface provided by the API server 114.  The programmatic client 108 may, for example, be a seller application (e.g., the TurboLister application developed by eBay Inc., of San Jose,
Calif.) to enable sellers to author and manage listings on the networked system 102 in an off-line manner, and to perform batch-mode communications between the programmatic client 108 and the networked system 102.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 also illustrates a third party application 128, executing on a third party server machine 130, as having programmatic access to the networked system 102 via the programmatic interface provided by the API server 114.  For example, the
third party application 128 may, utilizing information retrieved from the networked system 102, support one or more features or functions on a website hosted by the third party.  The third party website may, for example, provide one or more promotional,
marketplace or payment functions that are supported by the relevant applications of the networked system 102.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a shopping experience system 200, according to various embodiments.  The system 200 may be implemented as hardware or as software executed by hardware (e.g., by one or more processors) comprises an identification
module 205, a receiver module 210, a shopping experience module 215, and a presentation module 220.  Various modules of the shopping experience system may exist at a mall kiosk such as the shopping experience kiosk 110.  Alternatively, various modules of

<br/><br/> Modules, Components and Logic
<br/><br/> Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components, modules, or mechanisms.  Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code embodied (1) on a non-transitory machine-readable medium or (2) in a
transmission signal) or hardware-implemented modules.  A hardware-implemented module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner.  In example embodiments, one or more computer systems
(e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more processors may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware-implemented module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, a hardware-implemented module may be implemented mechanically or electronically.  For example, a hardware-implemented module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a
special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations.  A hardware-implemented module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as
encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations.  It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware-implemented module mechanically,
in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, the term "hardware-implemented module" should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired) or temporarily or transitorily configured (e.g.,
programmed) to operate in a certain manner and/or to perform certain operations described herein.  Considering embodiments in which hardware-implemented modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware-implemented modules need
not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time.  For example, where the hardware-implemented modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different
hardware-implemented modules at different times.  Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware-implemented module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware-implemented module at a
different instance of time.
<br/><br/> Hardware-implemented modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware-implemented modules.  Accordingly, the described hardware-implemented modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled.  Where multiple
of such hardware-implemented modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the hardware-implemented modules.  In embodiments in which multiple
hardware-implemented modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware-implemented modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the
multiple hardware-implemented modules have access.  For example, one hardware-implemented module may perform an operation, and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled.  A further hardware-implemented
module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output.  Hardware-implemented modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of
information).
<br/><br/> The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations.  Whether
temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions.  The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise
processor-implemented modules.
<br/><br/> Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented.  For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor-implemented modules.  The performance of
certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines.  In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single
location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.
<br/><br/> The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a "cloud computing" environment or as a "software as a service" (SaaS).  For example, at least some of the operations maybe performed by a group of
computers (as examples of machines including processors), these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., Application Program Interfaces (APIs).)
<br/><br/> Electronic Apparatus and System
<br/><br/> Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them.  Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product, e.g., a computer program
tangibly embodied in an information carrier, e.g., in a machine-readable medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus, e.g., a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple computers.
<br/><br/> A computer program can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use
in a computing environment.  A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
<br/><br/> In example embodiments, operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output.  Method operations can also be performed by, and
apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).
<br/><br/> The computing system can include clients and servers.  A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network.  The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs
running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.  In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system, it will be appreciated that that both hardware and software architectures require consideration. 
Specifically, it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware (e.g., an ASIC), in temporarily configured hardware (e.g., a combination of software and a programmable processor), or a
combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice.  Below are set out hardware (e.g., machine) and software architectures that may be deployed, in various example embodiments.
<br/><br/> Example Machine Architecture and Machine-Readable Medium
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 illustrates an example diagram of a representation of a machine in the example form of a computer system 1800 that may be used, according to some embodiments.  In alternative embodiments, the machine operates as a standalone device or
may be connected (e.g., networked) to other machines.  In a networked deployment, the machine may operate in the capacity of a server or a client machine in server-client network environment, or as a peer machine in a peer-to-peer (or distributed)
network environment.  The machine may be a personal computer (PC), a tablet PC, a set-top box (STB), a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a web appliance, a network router, switch or bridge, or any machine capable of executing
instructions (sequential or otherwise) that specify actions to be taken by that machine.  Further, while only a single machine is illustrated, the term "machine" shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly
execute a set (or multiple sets) of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.
<br/><br/> The example computer system 1800 includes a processor 1802 (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU) or both), a main memory 1804 and a static memory 1806, which communicate with each other via a bus 1808.  The
computer system 1800 may further include a video display unit 1810 (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a cathode ray tube (CRT)).  The computer system 1800 also includes an alphanumeric input device 1812 (e.g., a keyboard or a touch-sensitive
display screen), a user interface (UI) navigation device 1814 (e.g., a mouse), a disk drive unit 1816, a signal generation device 1818 (e.g., a speaker) and a network interface device 1820.
<br/><br/> Machine-Readable Medium
<br/><br/> The disk drive unit 1816 includes a machine-readable medium 1822 on which is stored one or more sets of instructions and data structures (e.g., software) 1824 embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described
herein.  The instructions 1824 may also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory 1804 and/or within the processor 1802 during execution thereof by the computer system 1800, the main memory 1804 and the processor 1802 also
constituting machine-readable media.
<br/><br/> While the machine-readable medium 1822 is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium, the term "machine-readable medium" may include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and/or associated
caches and servers) that store the one or more instructions or data structures.  The term "machine-readable medium" shall also be taken to include any tangible medium, that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the
machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention, or that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such instructions.  The term "machine-readable
medium" shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, and optical and magnetic media.  Specific examples of machine-readable media include non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory
devices, e.g., Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM), Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), and flash memory devices; magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and
DVD-ROM disks.
<br/><br/> Transmission Medium
<br/><br/> The instructions 1824 may further be transmitted or received over a communications network 1826 using a transmission medium.  The instructions 1824 may be transmitted using the network interface device 1820 and any one of a number of well-known
transfer protocols (e.g., HTTP).  Examples of communication networks include a total area network ("LAN"), a wide area network ("WAN"), the Internet, mobile telephone networks, Plain Old Telephone (POTS) networks, and wireless data networks (e.g., Wifi
and WiMax networks).  The term "transmission medium" shall be taken to include any intangible medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine, and includes digital or analog communications signals or
other intangible media to facilitate communication of such software.
<br/><br/> Although an embodiment has been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the
invention.  Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.  The accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, show by way of illustration, and not of limitation, specific embodiments in
which the subject matter may be practiced.  The embodiments illustrated are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the teachings disclosed herein.  Other embodiments may be utilized and derived therefrom, such that

appended claims, along with the full range of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.
<br/><br/> Such embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be referred to herein, individually and/or collectively, by the term "invention" merely for convenience and without intending to voluntarily limit the scope of this application to any single
invention or inventive concept if more than one is in fact disclosed.  Thus, although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it should be appreciated that any arrangement calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted
for the specific embodiments shown.  This disclosure is intended to cover any and all adaptations or variations of various embodiments.  Combinations of the above embodiments, and other embodiments not specifically described herein, will be apparent to
