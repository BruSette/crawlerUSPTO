telephone with applications and other functionality (e.g., APPLE.RTM.  iPhone, RESEARCH IN MOTION.RTM.  Blackberry, HTC.RTM.  Android-based G1, or other mobile telephone), a handheld device with Wi-Fi connectivity (e.g., APPLE.RTM.  iTouch), a mobile
telephone with an enhanced roadside assistance application installed, or other portable electronic device.  The wireless-enabled devices 102, 104 may be configured to communicate with a wireless access point 106 such as a cellular tower operated by a
cellular service provider.  Alternatively, the wireless access point 106 may be a Wi-Fi (e.g., compatible with IEEE 802.11a/b/g/etc. wireless communication standards) hotspot where the wireless-enabled device 102, 104 may obtain access to the Internet
(e.g., to communicate using online chat applications or voice-over-IP applications).  One skilled in the art will appreciate that other techniques may be used to allow devices 102, 104 access over a wide area network (WAN).
<br/><br/> The data communicated from the user devices 102, 104 may be transmitted to a server 108.  The server 108 (e.g., a high-performance Intel.RTM.  computer) may include a memory 112 storing computer-readable instructions and a processor 114 for
executing the computer-readable instructions.  The data communicated to the server 108 from the user device 102, 104 may be transmitted over the WAN through wireless access point 106.  Meanwhile, another server 110 may be comprised of a memory 120
storing computer-readable instructions and a processor 116 for executing the computer-readable instructions in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.  The memories 112, 120 may also store computer data files that hold information that may be useful
to applications running on the user's mobile device 102, 104 or the servers 108, 110.  For example, the computer data files may include user login/profile information, insurance policy (or motor club) information, service provider list and related
information, and/or other information.  The data collected and stored in the data files may be used to support one or more of the numerous features disclosed throughout this disclosure.
<br/><br/> One skilled in the art will appreciate that the server (e.g., servers 110 and 108) is not limited to a single machine or device.  The server may be embodied as a web server or Internet-accessible server.  Furthermore, the term server refers to
any system of computers and/or devices (e.g., firewalls, routers, caching systems, proxy servers, etc. or combination thereof) that may be used to provide access to services and features available for use.  As such, different reference to the server
performing particular steps does not require that the same machine/device perform all the steps.
<br/><br/> Servers (108 and 110), data store 122, and wireless access point 106 may communicate over a wired and/or wireless connection.  In some instances, a private, secure connection may be established between one or more of these components.  For
example, server 108 and server 110 may communicate over a network cloud representing the Internet.  Alternatively, server 108 and data store 122 may communicate over a secure WAN or a dedicated T1 (or other telecommunications) line.  Furthermore,
wireless devices 102, 104 may include a processor, memory, display screen (e.g., touchscreen), keypad, sensors (e.g., motion, light, etc.), camera, global positioning system (GPS) chip, audio output/input devices, and other electronic components
configured for use in mobile phones, PDAs, and mini-laptops.
<br/><br/> In another example, one or more servers 108, 110 may include a processor, RAM, ROM, communications module, and/or memory storing an operating system, applications, and/or data.  The server may have a processor for controlling overall operation
of the server and its associated components, including random access memory, read-only memory, communications module, and memory.  Such a server may include a variety of computer readable media.  Computer readable media may be any available media, both
tangible and intangible, that may be accessed by the server and include both volatile and nonvolatile media, and removable and non-removable media.  By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise a combination of computer
storage media and communication media.  Computer storage media include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, object code,
data structures, program modules or other data.  Computer storage media include, but are not limited to, random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), electronically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), flash memory or other memory
technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to store the desired information and that
can be accessed by the server.
<br/><br/> The aforementioned server may include one or more applications representing the application data stored in RAM memory while the server is on and corresponding software applications (e.g., software tasks) are running on the server.  The
aforementioned communications module may include a microphone, keypad, touch screen, and/or stylus through which an (optional) user of the server may provide input, and may also include one or more of a speaker for providing audio output and a video
display device for providing textual, audio/visual and/or graphical output.  Software may be stored within the memory and/or storage to provide instructions to the processor for enabling the server to perform various functions.  For example, memory may
store software used by the server, such as an operating system, application programs, and/or an associated database.  Alternatively, some or all of the computer executable instructions for the server may be embodied in hardware or firmware.  Moreover, a
database (or data store) 122 may provide centralized storage of data.
<br/><br/> Such a server may operate in a networked environment supporting connections to one or more remote computing devices.  The remote computing devices may be personal computing devices or servers that include many or all of the elements described
above relative to the server.  Remote computing devices may be a mobile device communicating over wireless carrier channel.  The network connections depicted in the figures may include a local area network (LAN) and/or a wide area network (WAN), but may
also include other networks.  When used in a LAN networking environment, the server may be connected to the LAN through a network interface or adapter in the communications module.  When used in a WAN networking environment, the server may include a
modem in the communications module or other means for establishing communications over the WAN, such as the Internet.  It will be appreciated that the network connections shown and described are illustrative and other means of establishing a
communications link between the computing devices may be used.  The existence of any of various well-known protocols such as TCP/IP, Ethernet, FTP, HTTP and the like is presumed, and the system can be operated in a client-server configuration to permit a
user to retrieve web pages from a web-based server.  Any of various commonly known web browsers can be used to display and manipulate data on web pages.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 2, numerous mobile wireless-enabled devices are illustrated connecting to mobile architecture 200 over a wireless network.  The mobile architecture includes wired and/or wireless connections with servers, data store/database,
and a wireless access point.  An interactive voice response (IVR) system may also be included to facilitate services not using a cellular data plan.  Numerous different application servers and data stores may be included in the mobile architecture,
including, but not limited to, a database, application server, map server, software application for use at a call center or for a customer service platform), CTI (i.e., computer telephony integration--which presents voice and data within a customer
service platform), data store in which customer and supporting data tables may be housed), IVR (interactive voice response) server, web services application server, interceptor, and firewall.  The mobile wireless-enabled devices in FIG. 2 may have
application software installed in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure.  The application software may permit the mobile device to communicate with a remote web services application server through the firewall.  In an alternative embodiment,
the mobile device may have a thin-client installed that provides an interface for the mobile device to execute application software on a remote server.  One skilled in the art will appreciate the numerous advantages and disadvantages related to the
thin-client and thick-client design choices contemplated by the various embodiments of the disclosure.  Moreover, in some embodiments, the mobile device may receive notifications of software updates (e.g., new versions) of the application and can receive
automatic (or manually authorized) download and installation of the updates.
<br/><br/> Flat Tire.
<br/><br/> In one example in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, John Doe's (i.e., a user) vehicle has a flat tire.  John has previously installed a roadside assistance application in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure on his
APPLE.RTM.  iPhone, and he has registered his vehicle with the application.  After launching the roadside assistance application, the registered application attempts to assess whether John is in a safe location.  If John presses the "911" icon, the
application will automatically dial the emergency line to locate emergency assistance for John.  However, in this case, John is at the parking garage near his office building, and he presses the "Yes" icon.
<br/><br/> Next the application, in this example, requests information about John's service needs (see FIG. 5).  The application provides a list of services 500 to John in a "Service Type" selection box.  Some examples of service types include, but are not
limited to, locked out (i.e., locked out of one's vehicle), flat tire/tire needs air/tire change, dead battery/battery service/battery replacement, jump start, out of gas/incorrect fuel/fluids, towing, vehicular accident/vehicle fire, mechanical
failure/brakes/transmission/engine, lock out/locked out/lost keys/damage keys/keys locked in car, locksmith, winch/stuck, won't start, stalled while driving, reunite, dealer service, transfer, recovery, wrecker, and other (i.e., the service type when
none of the listed services are appropriate).  In addition, in those cases where the mobile device 102, 104 provides functionality to retrieve and display a user's phone number, the application may retrieve and display that information.  John, in some
embodiments, may be permitted to edit the callback number displayed by the application if he desires.
<br/><br/> In an alternative example, the mobile device 102, 104 may automatically receive information about the vehicle directly through communications with the vehicle's onboard diagnostics system (e.g., on-board diagnostics including OBDII interface or
other comparable interface with the vehicle's diagnostics system).  The mobile device 102 may be equipped with appropriate circuitry and/or firmware/software to communicate via the requisite communication protocols for the ODB II interface. 
Alternatively, an external accessory (e.g., peripheral device) may be attached to the ODB II interface to translate the ODB II codes/data into a format compatible with the communication protocol of the application on the mobile device 102, 104.  For
example, the external accessory may be a bluetooth-compliant device that receives the ODB II data and transmits it via bluetooth to the mobile device 102.  Alternatively, the external accessory may attach to the pins on a mobile device 102 and receive
the data wirelessly transmitted from the ODB II interface.  The information received from the vehicle (e.g., through the ODB II interface) may be used to select the appropriate service type without requiring additional user intervention.  Moreover, the
ODB II codes may be useful to a service provider (e.g., towing company or mechanic) in contemplating the needs of the user in preparation for addressing the user's calamity.
<br/><br/> In yet another alternative example, John's vehicle may be equipped with a wireless transmission module (e.g., transceiver circuitry) to transmit diagnostic information to a car dealership that services his vehicle.  The car dealership may then
transmit the information to John (e.g., via an onboard display on the vehicle's dashboard).  In accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, assume John Doe is driving a BMW.RTM.  brand vehicle equipped with BMWAssist.RTM..  John may register on a
server 108 to have updates from a third party (e.g., BMW) computer server routed through a server 108 to his mobile device 102 whenever a defect in his vehicle is detected.  John Doe can designate computer server 108 to receive notifications on his
behalf from the third-party server.  As such, the computer server 108, in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, can process and transmit the notification to John's mobile device 102.  For example, the third-party server may receive
notification that a flat-tire has occurred on John Doe's vehicle, and may send a notification to John Doe's mobile device 102 indicating the service type required.  Consequently, the "Service Type" information may be pre-filled in the application
selection screen.  Moreover, in such an example, John may or may not need to be physically present at his vehicle.  For example, John may have parked his vehicle in an outdoor lot on a cold winter day while at his office, and he may receive a
notification (e.g., a push notification available on APPLE.RTM.  iPhone OS 3.0 and later, SMS message, e-mail, etc.) on his mobile device 102 in the afternoon stating that his battery has gone dead.  John may use his mobile device 102, in accordance with
the various aspects of the disclosure disclosed herein, to contact a preferred service provider and repair his vehicle, all while within the comfort of his warm office and not physically present at his vehicle.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the ODB II codes (or other types of diagnostic codes) transmitted from the vehicle to the mobile device 102 may be translated to map against the numerous "Service Type" selections available.  ODB II codes (and other types of
diagnostic codes) may be different for different make and model of cars; therefore, when a user registers with the application and provides information about his/her vehicle, the appropriate mapping for the type of car can be identified and used for
translating diagnostic codes.  The mapping table may be stored in computer memory at the mobile device 102 or may be maintained in memory 112 at a remote server 108.  Likewise, the translation may occur at a processor at the mobile device 102 or at the
remote server 108.  One skilled in the art will appreciate that there are numerous benefits and drawbacks to each approach.
<br/><br/> Next, mobile device 102 transmits data, either directly or indirectly, to the remote server 108.  The transmission may occur in response to a user keypress (e.g., the user selecting a phone icon on the mobile device 102 display).  Alternatively,
the transmission may occur automatically (e.g., in the embodiments where the ODB II codes are automatically retrieved and transmitted).  The data transmitted from the mobile device 102 may include, but is not limited to, the "service type" selected, user
identification information (e.g., the mobile device 102 phone number, user's login/username, etc.), location information (e.g., retrieved from the mobile device 102, manually entered by the user, triangulated from cellular towers by the cellular service
provider, etc.), vehicle diagnostic data (e.g., OBD II data/codes), and other useful information.
<br/><br/> Next, the server 108 receives the data transmitted from the mobile device 102.  The server 108 may use the data to identify one or more service providers (e.g., towing company, taxi company, mechanic, etc.) in the area.  In one embodiment, the
identification may occur in real-time using an algorithmic selection process that maintains ratings and other metrics about the service providers, and selects one or more provider based on these ratings and metrics.  In another embodiment, the provider
identified may be based on a company's preferred high-quality relationship with particular service providers.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, the server 108 may transmit information about one or more service providers to the mobile device 102 for the user's review and final selection.  As such, information such as a
service provider's name, contact information, rating, and other metrics (e.g., distance from mobile device's location, cost, etc.) may be displayed on the user's mobile device 102.  In an alternative embodiment, the server 108 may communicate directly
with a service provider and hire a service provider to service the user.  For example, the server 108 may communicate over a network (e.g., the Internet, WAN, etc.) with a service provider's server 110.  The server 110 may receive a request for a
particular service.  The request may include pertinent information about the service required, including the location of the vehicle requiring servicing, the type of service required, the make/model/color of the vehicle requiring servicing, the maximum
charge allowed for the service (e.g., pre-contracted towing rates), and other information.
<br/><br/> The service provider's server 110 may communicate the information to mobile devices carried by (or installed in the vehicles of) its employees in the field.  As such, the employee can accept or reject the new service request.  Alternatively, the
server 110 may communicate the information to employees located at an office and that are responsible for facilitating new service requests and dispatching service vehicles (e.g., using a wireless dispatch system).  Once the service provider accepts the
new service request, their server 110 transmits an acceptance message to the server 108.  In order to facilitate simultaneous communication to multiple service providers, the server 108 may be required to send a confirmation message to the service
provider once acceptance has been received and accepted.  At least one benefit of such a system is that multiple service providers may be contacted with a request for a particular service, and then only the "best" service provider willing to accept the
service request may be confirmed for the job.  In one embodiment in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, the service providers may include a price or quote (or other information, such as estimated time of arrival at the user's vehicle) in
its acceptance message.  As such, service providers may compete (e.g., in an auction-like system) for new servicing jobs.  Alternatively, the "best" service provider may simply be the first to reply with an acceptance message.  In some embodiments, the
server 108 may also transmit a cancellation message to the other service providers (i.e., everyone except the one receiving a confirmation message) once a new service request has been filled so that the other service providers are updated about the
current status of filled new service requests.  Alternatively, new service requests may automatically expire after a predetermined time period.  As such, a cancellation message may not be necessary.
<br/><br/> The server 108 may transmit to the mobile device 102 information about the service provider that will be servicing the user's vehicle.  The information may include, but is not limited to the name of the service provider, the estimated time of
arrival (ETA), the phone number for the service provider (or the mobile phone number of the particular service vehicle servicing the user's vehicle), and/or other useful information.  For example, FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary "service details" screen
600.  In some embodiments, the user is conveniently provided with the option of providing feedback while he/she waits for a service provider to arrive.  In some embodiments, the mobile device 102 may receive regular (e.g., every 5 minutes, real-time, or
on another regular or periodic basis) updates from the server 108 with the approximate location of the service vehicle that will be servicing the user's vehicle.  The approximate location may be displayed on a map or may be provided as an approximate
distance from the user's vehicle.  Moreover, the approximate time until arrival may be displayed and updated on a regular or periodic basis.
<br/><br/> In an alternative embodiment, server 108 may provide the mobile device 102 with information about service providers.  The user may contact the service providers directly (e.g., by calling their office) to arrange for a service provider.  At
least one advantage of such a system over simply looking up service providers in a telephone directory is that the server 108 may be able to provide an enhanced list of service providers to the mobile device 102.  For example, the list may include one or
more service providers that are competent in the particular type of service required of the user's vehicle.  As such, the user need not be concerned with whether a particular service provider offers the particular service required of the user's vehicle.
<br/><br/> In addition, the server 108 may transmit relevant information to the user's insurance company, emergency contacts, police, fire department, taxi company, and/or others.  For example, information necessary for starting a claim may be submitted to
the insurance company so the user's process for submitting the claim is already partially completed.  In some embodiments, the user may retain full control over whether the insurance company is notified of the user's vehicle situation.
<br/><br/> Moreover, a user's parents, spouse, coworkers, etc. may be contacted to alert them about the user's vehicle situation.  For example, in one embodiment, the server 108 may receive notification from the user's mobile device 102, and then reference
the user's preferences.  A copy of the user's preferences may be saved in memory, e.g., as a data file, at the server 108.  The preferences may indicate which additional people or organizations to contact and what information to provide to those people. 
In another embodiment, the application may enable the user to save his/her emergency contact's information on the mobile device 102.  For example, the user may enter his insurance agent's information, personal contact information, and emergency contact
information.  Alternatively, the screen may permit entry of other relevant information about each contact (e.g., email address, SMS number, alternate phone numbers, etc.) As such, the user may conveniently access his contacts through the application's
menu.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the server 108 may automatically send a text message (e.g., SMS, etc.) to the user's parent's phone number (or other people's phone numbers) with a predetermined message.  The server 108 may alternatively send an e-mail
message to the desired person/organization's email address.  In some embodiments, the desired person may have an application installed on his/her mobile device 102 that receives a push notification initiated by server 108.  The push notification may
include a textual message and/or other appropriate information (e.g., the location of the vehicle/user, the condition of the vehicle, whether anyone is injured, etc.) Alternatively, a customer service representative may be alerted by server 108 to
manually call the desired person/organization and provide an appropriate message.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, the user may be provided with a guided experience when requesting roadside assistance.  The guided experience may be implemented using a series of icons along the top of the
screen on the user's mobile device 102.  One skilled in the art will appreciate that the guided experience may be provided through different configurations of the icons; for example, the icons may be placed vertically along a side of the screen, or they
may be configured in a circular or other pattern around the screen.  The series of icons may tell the user where he/she in the process of obtaining roadside assistance.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, the application may verify that the user is in a safe location.  An option for calling "911" may be provided should the user require immediate emergency assistance.  Next, as
depicted in FIG. 3, the application may request information about the type of service the user requires.  As discussed in detail above, there are numerous service types 300 that may be available for the user to select.  Moreover, as already discussed
herein, in some embodiments, the user's vehicle may be equipped with appropriate technology to communicate directly with the mobile device to provide/recommend the service type information.  Next, the application may direct the user to call a roadside
assistance customer service representative to identify and secure the appropriate roadside service provider for the user.  The application on the mobile device 102 may transmit the appropriate information (e.g., member number, member's zip code, service
type requested, and/or user's current location) to the customer service center.  As such, the representative may already have information about the user and/or user's vehicle on-screen when the conversation begins.  Additional information about aspects
of this feature is disclosed below, including the use of a caller ID feature to automatically match the user with his/her information.
<br/><br/> Once the service provider arrives to provide the user's vehicle with roadside assistance, the user may use his/her mobile device 102 to authorize payment to the service provider.  For example, the mobile device 102 may display an icon to permit
the user to indicate that service has been satisfactorily provided and completed.  Upon receipt of a corresponding message at the server 108 from the mobile device 102, the server 108 may authorize release of funds to the service provider.  For example,
the server 108 may authorize a bank to perform an ACH transaction of funds directly into the service provider's bank account.  In one example, the funds are sourced from the user's bank account; while in another example, the funds are sourced directly
from the account of the company providing the roadside assistance program.  Meanwhile, in another example a first person (e.g., a parent) may arrange for a second person (e.g., their child) to authorize release of the parent's funds to the service
provider.  The server 108 may also notify the service provider's server 110 that payment has been authorized.  As such, service provider may receive more prompt payment for its services, while also reducing the need to process claims at the insurance
company.
<br/><br/> Vehicle Incident.
<br/><br/> In yet another example in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, two user vehicles may be involved in a vehicular crash.  In such a scenario, the two users may exchange insurance information and other information (e.g., pictures of
the crash site taken with a camera on the mobile device 102) wirelessly using their mobile device 102.  For example, an application in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure may enable the users to wirelessly transmit (e.g., using Bluetooth,
SMS messaging, e-mail, or other wireless transmission techniques) their information to the other user's mobile device.  At least one benefit is that the exchange of information between the parties is much more convenient given the stressful situation of
a vehicular crash.
<br/><br/> In addition, the user may contact a customer service representative to report the vehicular incident.  In accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, the representative may already have information about the user and/or user's vehicle
on-screen when initiating conversation.  For example, the application on the mobile device 102 may transmit the device's phone number and other information (e.g., accident information, user's location, pictures, or other information) to server 108.  As
such, the representative's system may use the caller ID feature to appropriately identify the transmitted data as corresponding to the phone number identified on the caller ID.  Therefore, information about the user and/or user vehicle may already be
displayed on the representative's screen when the call commences.  Thus, an enhanced roadside assistance program may be offered to users.
<br/><br/> Preventive Measures.
<br/><br/> As explained earlier, vehicles with onboard diagnostic equipment (e.g., ODB II port) may be able to retrieve information about operating parameters of the user's vehicle.  As such, the diagnostic equipment may be able to assist the user in the
maintenance and upkeep of the vehicle; thus, resulting in a safer vehicle and hopefully fewer incidents.  The mobile device 102 may receive alert notifications when parameters of the vehicle are outside of normal operating limits or limits set by the
user or other entity.  For example, if the user's battery is dead or low, the user may receive a notification on the mobile device 102 (or elsewhere designated by the user) about the dead or failing car battery.  Likewise, if the vehicle's tire pressure
runs low, the mobile device 102 may receive a notification.  Along with the notification, the mobile device 102 may be provided with one or more service providers (e.g., towing companies, mechanics shops, or other providers) that can repair the problem.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3, the flowchart illustrates various features of the one or more embodiments of the disclosure.  The user may register using the mobile device 102, or may, in some embodiments, register online with a personal computer.  Once
the user is registered, information about the user (e.g., user profile information) may be stored on the mobile device 102 (or on a remote server 108).  That information may be useful in storing and displaying information about the user, including a
picture of the user's vehicle, make/model/year of the vehicle, vehicle's insurance policy (or motor club) number (e.g., virtual membership card), and other pertinent information.  In some embodiments, the user may only be "pre-registered" 302 (i.e.,
registered with the application with some basic information (e.g., name, vehicle, phone number, etc.), but may not have a membership in a roadside assistance program); thus, features such as the virtual membership card may be grayed out (i.e.,
deactivated) on the user's screen.  However, in one example, the pre-registered user may provide the application with some basic authentication information (e.g., last four digits of social security number, date of birth, and/or membership number) to
authenticate herself, and then need only provide 304 some minimal additional authorization information (e.g., credit card information, vehicle information, driver information, etc.) to activate/register 306 for membership in the roadside assistance
program.  At least one benefit of pre-registration is that a user can go through the lengthy registration process in advance, and then at the time of a roadside event (e.g., car crash), the user can activate the pre-registration for membership privileges
with minimal hassle.
<br/><br/> One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the flowcharts illustrate just some examples of functions/features available in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, and that other examples of features are available as
described throughout the specification and figures.  For example, various aspects of the disclosure include a feature for obtaining customer feedback.  The feature enables prompt and accurate feedback about the user's experience because, inter alia, the
feedback is collected almost immediately after the event of interest, and the questions can be tailored to the specifics of the particular event/user/details.
<br/><br/> Regarding user vehicle registration, the user may enter various information to register for enhanced roadside assistance.  In some embodiments, the user may enter just the vehicle VIN (vehicle identification number).  The server 108 and/or
mobile device 102 may store the VIN and retrieve information about the vehicle (e.g., made, model, year, etc.) based off the VIN.  In an alternative embodiment, the user may also be required to enter membership information, such as name, zip code, or a
member identification number.  The membership information may be linked to the user's insurance or motor club profile and mapped as such on server 108.  As a result, future communications between the mobile device 102 and the server 108 may be recognized
as related to a particular member.  Membership may refer to membership in a roadside assistance program, motor club, or other group/organization.
<br/><br/> Electronic Membership Card.
<br/><br/> Membership information may be illustrated in an exemplary virtual membership card screen, as depicted in FIG. 4.  The member card screen 400 may illustrate the date through which the user's membership is valid and/or the date since the user has
been a member.  The user's membership number, membership level (e.g., Platinum), and other information may also be displayed on the membership card screen.  At least some of the information displayed on the membership card screen may be locally stored on
the mobile device 102.  As such, the user need not be connected to a carrier or WiFi in order to retrieve his/her membership information.  Alternatively, membership information may be stored on a server 108 and retrieved for display on the screen.  At
least one benefit of an electronic membership card is that changes to the user's policy and/or other updates may be dynamically pushed to the user's mobile device 102.  As such, the user may have instant access to updated policy information and need not
necessarily wait for an insurance company to mail him/her an updated membership card.  In addition, the membership card screen may include information about services and promotions offered to members.  For example, a roadside assistance icon may appear
to indicate that roadside assistance on the go is available to the user.  In addition, promotions and discounts, for example on travel (e.g., flights, rental cars, hotels, etc.) may be available to members and a corresponding icon or information may
appear on the membership card screen accordingly.
<br/><br/> Meanwhile, a service provider may also be provided with a registration screen in some embodiments in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.  Service provider vehicles may be equipped with wireless-enabled devices (e.g., navigation systems
with Internet connectivity) that permit the vehicle operator to react in realtime to service requests.  For example, the exact location of the service vehicle can be tracked using this onboard device.
<br/><br/> Enhanced Interactive Voice Response (IVR).
<br/><br/> In an alternative embodiment, information from the application on the mobile device 102 may be transmitted to a remote server related to an IVR system.  For wireless devices 102 with a mobile data plan, the information may be transmitted over a
wireless Internet connection.  However, in those instances where the mobile device does not have data connectivity, the device may transmit the data to the IVR system using other available means.  For example, in one embodiment, the information may be
transmitted as a SMS (or comparable text message format) message to the IVR system.  As a result, when a user calls into the IVR system, the user may receive an enhanced experience because the user's location and other relevant information may already be
available at the IVR system.  The IVR may, in some embodiments, still confirm for security reasons the name of the member, zip code of the member, and service requested before transferring the user to a service provider.  The disclosed enhanced IVR is
beneficial because it alleviates the requirement to have the user listen to endless prompts and respond with touchtone key presses.  In some examples, if the user wishes to speak with a customer service representative, he/she may press "0" (or other
designated key) to immediately speak with a representative.
<br/><br/> Other features in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure are listed below.  For example, server 108 may generate a user driving score based on the user's reactions to communications and recommendations from an insurance company or a
motor club.  The driving score may be used to adjust the user's insurance premiums or membership dues and/or other aspects of the user's insurance policy or motor club membership.  In another example, the mobile device 102 may provide the user with
information regarding the relative safety of proposed navigation routes as, for example, is described in the provisional applications, which were previously incorporated by reference in their entireties.  In yet another example, the mobile device 102 may
provide different color-coded zones on a map to indicate the relative safety of various areas.  For example, the mobile device 102 may alert the user that a particular intersection is particularly hazardous and has a statistically higher frequency of
vehicle incidents.  One or more of these features may be provided in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure.  In yet another example, the mobile device may provide the user with information regarding the relative safety of drivers or vehicles
in the vicinity of the user.  This information may be provided through transmission of scores or other data regarding the drivers or vehicles in the vicinity of the user.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a system is described where two servers and a mobile device assist in providing roadside assistance.  The mobile device may communicate with a first server and provide various
information about the status of a vehicle, the user, and/or other information.  The first server may communicate with a second server to electronically request, approve, and monitor a service provider hired to service the vehicle.  The first server may
provide information and/or regular updates to the mobile device regarding the service provider.  The first server may also authorize payment to the service provider once the job is completed.  One or more aspects of the aforementioned embodiment are
described in greater detail throughout the disclosure.
<br/><br/> Some features in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure enhance end-to-end roadside experience by leveraging mobile technology and intelligent back office systems.  FIG. 7 illustrates system 700 for providing roadside services and
will be discussed in further detail.  A user application (e.g., executing on terminal 102 as shown in FIG. 1) may leverage GPS and interactive satellite imagery to assist the user to identify the vehicle location of the user.  Also a user application may
walk the user through the identification of a disablement event and the selection of the service remedy.
<br/><br/> Dispatch portlet 705 may be a real-time conduit to an application execution on mobile device 704 as well as a transaction hub for system 700.  Dispatch portlet 705 may be a real-time conduit to the dispatch system.  For example, dispatch portlet
705 may serve to enable non-centralized or 3.sup.rd party customer service locations to take customer information and submit dispatch transactions.  The portlet 705 may thus become the interface for non-central to 3.sup.rd party representatives to
initiate, confirm, cancel, update and review roadside transactions.
<br/><br/> Some features in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure may enhance a user's confidence in advance of the arrival time of a service technician (e.g., a service provider's employee).  The time between the request of service and the
arrival of the technician may be an important factor of the user's perception of the roadside service.  In addition, a picture, name, etc. of the service provider's employee scheduled to service the vehicle may further enhance a user's confidence/comfort
in the service provider.  Request confirmation and progress updates may be supported to enhance a user's experience.  Also, aspects of the disclosure enable the user to call ahead to schedule repair service and/or notify a family member about the
disablement event.
<br/><br/> Some features, in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, measure the performance of service providers that may be based on one or more performance criteria.  Performance criteria may include on-time arrival at the user's location,
the ability to correctly remedy the disablement event, a degree of satisfaction by the user (e.g., the driver of the vehicle), and/or other factors.  Consequently, those service providers having the best satisfaction scores may be preferred for future
roadside work.
<br/><br/> Support for Service Provider and Service Technician.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 7, aspects of the disclosure provide an application that may be executed on a technician's mobile device 701.  FIGS. 8-11 illustrate exemplary screenshots of an application that provides information to a technician for roadside
assistance in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure.  For example, the technician may be an OEM mobile technician who may activate the application by logging into an application through screen 800.  As shown in FIG. 9, screen 900 displays
roadside jobs (e.g., any repair service offered by a service provider, including but not limited to jobs along a roadside) that may be available/accessible to the technician.  The technician may obtain information about a roadside job by selecting it on
screen.  As shown in FIG. 10, the technician may obtain information about the selected job and may accept or decline the job through fields 1001 and 1002, respectively.  The technician may obtain further information about the job as shown in FIG. 11 by
clicking on field 1003.  The additional information may include the customer's name, phone number, vehicle identification number, and/or description of the vehicle problem.  While not explicitly shown in screen 1100, further information about the
disablement event may be provided.  For example, a picture of the vehicle provided by the user (as exemplified in FIG. 18) and additional information about the problem (as exemplified in FIG. 19) may be included in screen 1100 or a similar screen.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 9, the technician may select a displayed roadside job by clicking on the displayed item.  Screen 900 may be organized by computing device 702, where the displayed roadside jobs may be ordered in some fashion.  For example, the
displayed items may be ordered by time of occurrence, proximity to the technician, priority of the roadside job, or a combination thereof.  According to one aspect, the ordering of the displayed roadside jobs may be based on the value of the estimated
time of arrival (ETA), e.g., from the shortest ETA to the longest ETA.  According to another aspect, the ordering of the displayed roadside jobs may be based on a grade of service.  For example, a customer may receive different grades of service (e.g.,
premium service versus standard service) based on the customer's desired subscription plan.
<br/><br/> According to an aspect, a computer device (e.g., incorporated at a technician mobile device 701 or back office component (remote server) 706 as shown in FIG. 7) may order the displayed roadside jobs according to at least one criterion.  For
example, back office component 706 may retrieve the list of jobs for a roadside technician from a database, order the job entries, and then transmit the ordered list to the technician's wireless device (e.g., a smartphone) 701.  As another example,
server 706 may pull and send an unordered list to the technician's wireless device 701, which then orders and displays the list on the user's screen.
<br/><br/> According to another aspect, a screen showing roadside jobs may display certain jobs in a particular region of the screen.  For example, if a user is directly or indirectly (within a predetermined degree of separation) connected to a technician
(or the service provider) via <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or some other social network, the entry for the user may be displayed at/near the top of the list of available jobs.  As another example, if the user and technician has had prior dealings together, the user's job
may appear at the top of the particular technician's list of available jobs, where a designated text or graphic symbol may be displayed next to such jobs.  As another example, jobs may be automatically prioritized in ascending order of ETA. 
Consequently, jobs with the nearest ETA appear at the top, while jobs with the longest ETA appear at the bottom.  The ETA differential, or the time it takes to get from one job to the next, may then be obvious to the technician.
<br/><br/> Again referring to FIG. 9, with some embodiments a customer may be connected with a technician through social networking.  For example, the customer may be directly connected to a technician (or the service provider) via <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or some other
social network.  In such a case, the customer may be displayed at or near the top of the list of available roadside jobs.  With another example, a customer may not be directly connected to the technician but may be connected by two or more degrees of
separation.
<br/><br/> Again referring to FIG. 9, the technician may have previously handled a roadside occurrence for the customer.  Consequently, the technician may be knowledgeable about the problem so the current roadside job for the customer is displayed at/near
the top of the list of roadside jobs or marked (e.g., by a "star" or other graphical symbol) in the list.
<br/><br/> With some embodiments, one or more applications may provide roadside information to independent providers.  For example, FIG. 12 illustrates an exemplary screenshot of an application that executes on computing device 702 (as shown in FIG. 7) and
that supports a service provider's portal for roadside assistance in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure.  Screen 1200 may serve as the provider's dispatch tool as well as a provider-facing portal for the roadside assistance service.  With
some embodiments, screen 1200 and/or additional screens (not explicitly shown) may support dispatching, tracking, history and performance, web claims, training, tow specification, administration, and/or messaging.
<br/><br/> Screen 1200 may show a summary of roadside jobs corresponding to the number of requests, completed jobs, and the average wait time in region 1201.  Also, a map showing the location of the different jobs may be displayed in region 1202.  The
statuses of new, in progress, and completed roadside jobs are shown in regions 1203, 1204, and 1205, respectively.
<br/><br/> With an aspect of the disclosure, the current status of a roadside job may be displayed on an associated customer's mobile device as the status changes to keep the customer notified.  For example, the different states of the status may include:
Open dispatch: The roadside job has not been assigned to a roadside technician.  Assigned dispatch: The roadside job has been assigned to a roadside technician.  En-route: The technician is traveling to the roadside job but is farther than a
predetermined distance and/or time threshold.  Approach: The technician is within a predetermined distance and/or time threshold.  On site: The technician is at the customer's location.  Complete: This status is dependent on the type of roadside job. 
For some types of roadside jobs, e.g., tire changes, the job may be completed by the technician arrives at the job location.  For other types of roadside jobs, e.g., towing a customer's vehicle, the status changes to the on-site status when the
technician arrives at the job location.  When the customer's vehicle is loaded on the towing truck, the job is complete when after the vehicle arrives at its destination.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 shows another exemplary screen of an application that executes on computing device 702 (as shown in FIG. 7) and that supports a service provider's portal for roadside assistance in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure.
<br/><br/> Computing device 702 may interact with one or more computing devices 703 that are associated with one or more technicians.  FIGS. 14-16 illustrate exemplary screenshots of an application that provides information to a technician for roadside
assistance in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure.  The application executing on device 703 may perform in concert with the application executing on device 702 so that the particular technician at device 703 views roadside jobs assigned to
that technician or that may be accepted/declined by the technician.
<br/><br/> Screen 1500 shows information about a roadside job that the technician may accept or decline after logging into the application through screen 1400.  The information may include a description of the disablement event 1501, location and picture
of the vehicle 1502, and vehicle description 1503.
<br/><br/> With some embodiments, an estimated time of arrival (ETA) may be displayed in region 1504.  The ETA may be approximated by an application executing on the technician's computer device (e.g., device 703) based on the distance and traffic
conditions between the technician and the roadside job.  In addition, the technician may be able to adjust the ETA by clicking on the "-" and "+" buttons within region 1504, for example, when traffic conditions or the technician's status changes.
<br/><br/> With some embodiments, a customer may be notified about an adjusted ETA for the customer's associated roadside job.  The adjusted ETA may be determined by an application executing on the technician's computer device, as described previously, or
may execute on a component of back office 706 as shown in FIG. 7.  The adjusted ETA may be determined from the distance and/or traffic conditions between the technician and the customer.
<br/><br/> The technician may obtain a history of roadside jobs in screen 1600.  The technician may then select one of the unassigned jobs to obtain further details in screen 1600.
<br/><br/> Satellite Imagery.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 17-18 illustrate exemplary screenshots of an application that provides location information about a user's vehicle using satellite imagery in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure.  As preciously discussed with FIG. 14,
location information about the user's vehicle may be provided to the service provider to, inter alia, expedite the arrival of a technician.  With embodiments of the disclosure, a satellite image may be displayed to the user based on approximate location
information, e.g., from a GPS integrated circuit in mobile device 704 (as shown in FIG. 7).  Screen 1700 shows a corresponding satellite image, where the user may provide improved location information by moving pin 1701.  In the example, the user may
move pin 1701 so that location information is revised in screen 1800 as shown in FIG. 18, where the location changes from "115 S. Northwest Hwy" to "120 S. Northwest Hwy." Also, the user may provide a photograph of the vehicle through a camera of mobile
device 704 and a note about the location ("1.sup.ST FLR Parking Garage, stuck in fence in front") As shown in FIG. 15, this additional information may be provided to the technician to expedite the technician's arrival and/or diagnosis.
<br/><br/> Additional Information Provided by User.
<br/><br/> As previously discussed, a user (e.g., a customer, driver, etc.) may provide further information about the disablement event.  For example, in addition to merely indicating a "flat tire" as shown in FIG. 6, the user may further indicate which
tire is flat and whether the user has a spare tire as shown in FIG. 19.  Also, as previously discussed, the user may send a video image of the vehicle as shown in FIG. 20.
<br/><br/> Enhanced ETA Dashboard.
<br/><br/> In conjunction with the technician receiving additional information about the user and user vehicle, the user may receive additional information about the assigned technician.  FIG. 21 illustrates an exemplary screenshot of an application
executing on mobile device 704 in order to provide information such as an estimated time of arrival (ETA) of a technician at the user's vehicle in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure.  As shown in screen 2100, screen 2100 may show
information 2103 about the assigned technician, including a picture and name of the technician.  In addition, the dashboard may show an estimated time of arrival 2101 as well as an ETA confidence level 2102.  The ETA confidence level 2102 may be a
numeric, alpha-numeric, symbolic, or graphic representation.  For example, the ETA confidence level 2102 may be a red, yellow, or green graphical representation corresponding to bad, satisfactory, and excellent, respectively.  In one example, the ETA
confidence level 2102 may be based on the on-time percentage of the particular technician over a historical period of time (e.g., the last 6 months, the last 30 days, the last year, over all time, or some other time period).  In another example, the
confidence level 2102 may be based on user feedback and provided ratings.  In yet another example, the confidence level 2102 may be provided by an input (e.g., high, medium, or low) from the assigned technician or may be affected by the technician's
input.  In yet another example, the confidence level 2102 may be based on a combination of the aforementioned, along with one or more other factors such a current traffic conditions.
<br/><br/> With an aspect of the disclosure, the ETA on screen 2100 may be updated when the ETA changes.  For example, the application executing at a computing device may revise the ETA when a technician at mobile device 703 incurs an unexpected delay or
is assigned another roadside job.
<br/><br/> The foregoing presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects.  It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention.
