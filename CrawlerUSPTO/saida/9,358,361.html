sensory experience database 126.  Presenter module 108 may present to health care provider 128, output device 130, and/or individual 134.  Output device 130 may include mobile device 132.  Modifier module 140 may include restrictor module 142, granter
module 144, alterer module 146, adder module 148, deleter module 150, and/or acceptor module 152.  System 100 generally represents instrumentality for accepting at least one attribute of at least one individual, querying at least one database at least
partly based on the at least one attribute, selecting from the at least one database at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual, and presenting an
indication of the at least one prescription medication and the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the selecting from the at least one database at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory
experience to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual.  The operations of accepting at least one attribute of at least one individual, querying at least one database at least partly based on the at least one attribute, selecting
from the at least one database at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual, and presenting an indication of the at least one prescription medication
and the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the selecting from the at least one database at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least
one individual may be accomplished electronically, such as with a set of interconnected electrical components, an integrated circuit, and/or a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an operational flow 200 representing example operations related to accepting at least one attribute of at least one individual, querying at least one database at least partly based on the at least one attribute, selecting from
the at least one database at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual, and/or presenting an indication of the at Least one prescription medication
and the at least one artificial sensory experience at (east partly based on the selecting from the at least one database at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least
one individual.  In FIG. 2 and in following figures that include various examples of operational flows, discussion and explanation may be provided with respect to the above-described examples of FIG. 1, and/or with respect to other examples and contexts. However, it should be understood that the operational flows may be executed in a number of other environments and contexts, and/or in modified versions of FIG. 1.  Also, although the various operational flows are presented in the sequence(s) illustrated,
it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently.
<br/><br/> After a start operation, the operational flow 200 moves to an operation 210.  Operation 210 depicts accepting at least one attribute of at least one individual.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, acceptor module 102 may accept at least one
attribute of at least one individual.  In one instance, acceptor module 102 can accept from a user 118 and a user interface 116 an attribute 120 including an attribute of a personal health history associated with an individual named John Smith.  In some
instances, acceptor module 102 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Then, operation 220 depicts querying at Least one database at least partly based on the at least one attribute.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, querier module 104 may search at least one database at least partly based on the at least one
attribute.  In one example and continuing with the previous example, querier module 104 can search a database 122 including a medication database 124 and artificial sensory experience database 126 at least partly based on the attribute including an
attribute of a personal health history associated with an individual named John Smith.  In some instances, querier module 104 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Then, operation 230 depicts selecting from the at least one database at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual.  For example, as shown in
FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select from the at least one database at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at Least one individual.  In one instance and continuing
with the previous example, selector module 106 can select from a medication database 124 and artificial sensory experience database 126 a prescription medication and an artificial sensory experience for addressing the attribute 120 including an attribute
of a personal health history associated with an individual named John Smith.  In some instances, selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Then, operation 240 depicts presenting an indication of the at least one prescription medication and the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the selecting from the at least one database at least one prescription
medication and at Least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, presenter module 108 may present the at Least one prescription medication and the at least one
artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the searching at least one database at least partly based on the at least one attribute.  In one instance and continuing with the previous example, presenter module 108 can present to a medical
professional the prescription medication and the artificial sensory experience based on searching the medication database 124 and artificial sensory experience database 126 based on the at least one attribute 120 including an attribute of a personal
health history associated with an individual named John Smith.  In some instances, presenter module 108 may include a computer processor.

virtual reality experience such as a Sesame Street or Disney-themed experience as the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partially based on an indication that the individual is aged 6-10 years old.  In some instances, selector module 106
may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 2306 illustrates selecting the at Least one artificial sensory experience at least partially based on at least one of geographic location, family status, age, gender, weight, ethnicity, body mass index, household size, or
income of the at least one individual.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select the at Least one artificial sensory experience at Least partially based on at least one of geographic location, family status, age, gender, weight,
ethnicity, body mass index, household size, or income of the at least one individual.  In one example, selector module 106 can select the artificial sensory experience based on an age and a weight associated with the at least one individual.  A
geographic Location may include a location where an individual currently resides, has resided in the past, and/or has visited.  A family status may include marital status, status and/or presence of children, and/or the status and/or health of extended
family.  In some instances, selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 24 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 200 of FIG. 2.  FIG. 24 illustrates example embodiments where operation 230 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include an
operation 2402, and/or an operation 2404.
<br/><br/> Operation 2402 illustrates selecting the at least one artificial sensory experience at Least partially based on at least one of a medication history or an artificial sensory experience history of the at least one individual.  For example, as
shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select the at least one artificial sensory experience at Least partially based on at least one of a medication history or an artificial sensory experience history of the at least one individual.  In one instance,
selector module 106 can select an artificial sensory experience based on an artificial sensory experience history of the at least one individual.  An artificial sensory experience history may include any record of at least one administered artificial
sensory experience history.  For example, system 100 and/or selector module 106 may select a modified <b><i>facebook</i></b> webpage having a cheerful color scheme at least partly based on a <b><i>facebook</i></b> usage history for an individual with signs of depression.  In some
instances, selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Operation 2404 illustrates selecting a preferred artificial sensory experience and at least one alternative artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select a preferred artificial sensory experience
and at Least one alternative artificial sensory experience.  In one example, selector module 106 can select a preferred artificial sensory experience and at least one alternative artificial sensory experience.  A preferred artificial sensory experience
may include a more desirable artificial sensory experience due to a lack of and/or a reduced level of side effects, reduced impact upon the individual, and/or increased compatibility with another medications and/or treatment.  An alternative artificial
sensory experience may include any artificial sensory experience in addition to the preferred artificial sensory experience and may be less desirable than the preferred artificial sensory experience due to side effects and/or increased impact upon the
individual.  In some instances, selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 25 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 200 of FIG. 2.  FIG. 25 illustrates example embodiments where operation 230 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include an
operation 2502, an operation 2504, and/or an operation 2506.
<br/><br/> Operation 2502 illustrates selecting at least one artificial sensory experience and at least one prescription medication at least partially based on a treatment algorithm.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select at least
one artificial sensory experience and at least one prescription medication at least partially based on a treatment algorithm.  In one instance, selector module 106 can select an artificial sensory experience and a prescription medication based on a
computer software treatment algorithm.  A treatment algorithm may include any computation, formula, statistical survey, and/or look-up table for determining and/or selecting a suitable artificial sensory experience and prescription medication
combination.  Some examples may include a computer software algorithm, a calculator, a flowchart, and/or a decision tree.  For example, system 100 and/or selector module 106 may, based on an accepted pain symptom of an individual, access a lookup chart
that matches the pain symptom with a pain medication, such as naproxen, and a virtual experience, such as World of Warcraft.  Such a combination therapy may be particularly effective in ameliorating the pain symptom in the individual.  In some instances,
selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 2504 illustrates selecting at least one prescription medication at least partially based on at least one of a drug allergy associated with the at least one individual or a drug interaction associated with the at least one
prescription medication.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select at least one prescription medication at least partially based on at Least one of a drug allergy associated with the at least one individual or a drug interaction
associated with the at least one prescription medication.  In one example, selector module 106 can select a prescription medication based on a drug allergy associated with the at least one individual.  A drug allergy may include any allergy to a drug
and/or drug intolerance.  Some examples of a drug allergy may include penicillin allergies, codeine allergies, and/or allergies to a dye in a drug.  A drug interaction may include an undesirable and/or unwanted reaction between two or more drugs and/or
medications.  For example, the system 100 and/or selector module 106 can select a prescription medication other than those that might cause a side effect in an individual, perhaps because of a known predisposition to the side effect (e.g., an allergy) or
because of a known drug-drug interaction relevant to the individual based on the individual's medication regimen.  In this way, risk of side effects can be lessened.  In some instances, selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Operation 2506 illustrates selecting at least one .degree.  plaid analgesic and at least one virtual world experience to address at Least one pain attribute of at Least one individual.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may
select from a prescription medication database at Least one opioid analgesic and at Least one virtual world experience to address at least one pain attribute of at least one individual.  In one example, selector module 106 can select an opioid analgesic
including morphine and a virtual world experience including an online game to address a pain attribute of at least one individual named Mary Andersen.  In some instances, selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 26 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 200 of FIG. 2.  FIG. 26 illustrates example embodiments where operation 240 may include at Least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include an
operation 2602, an operation 2604, and/or an operation 2606.
<br/><br/> Operation 2602 illustrates presenting an indication of a preferred combination including at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience and at least one alternative combination including at least one
alternative prescription medication and at least one alternative artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, presenter module 108 may present an indication of a preferred combination including at least one prescription medication and
at least one artificial sensory experience and at Least one alternative combination including at least one alternative prescription medication and at least one alternative artificial sensory experience.  In one instance, presenter module 108 can present
an indication of a preferred combination to an individual 134 including a prescription medication and an artificial sensory experience along with an alternative combination including an alternative prescription medication and an alternative artificial
sensory experience.  Individual 134 may include a single individual, multiple individuals, and/or an entity.  A preferred combination may include a more desirable combination due to a lack of and/or a reduced number of and/or level of side effects,
reduced impact upon the administered individual, and/or increased compatibility with another medications and/or treatment.  An alternative combination may include any combination in addition to the preferred combination and may be ostensibly less
desirable than the preferred artificial sensory experience because of a potential side effect and/or impact upon the administered individual.  Presentation of alternative combinations may provide benefits to the individual in terms of accessibility,
affordability, and/or personal preference of medication and/or artificial sensory experience.  In some instances, presenter module 108 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Operation 2604 illustrates presenting an indication of the at least one prescription medication and the at least one artificial sensory experience to at least one output device.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, presenter module 108 may present
an indication of the at least one prescription medication and the at least one artificial sensory experience to at least one output device.  In one example, presenter module 108 can present an indication of a prescription medication and an artificial
sensory experience to an output device 130 including a printer at a health clinic.  An output device may include any hardware device configured for receiving computer output.  Some examples of an output device may include a printer, a monitor, a mobile
phone, a speaker, and/or a visual display unit.  The output device may be used by individual 134.  In some instances, presenter module 108 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 2606 illustrates presenting an indication of at Least one of the at least one prescription medication or the at least one artificial sensory experience to at least one user interface.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1,

operation 2802, and/or an operation 2804.
<br/><br/> Operation 2802 illustrates presenting to a health care provider an indication of at Least one of the at least one prescription medication or the at (east one artificial sensory experience at Least partly based on the selecting at Least one
prescription medication and at Least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, presenter module 108 may present to a health care provider an indication of at
Least one of the at least one prescription medication or the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the selecting at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience to address an attribute of
an individual.  In one example, presenter module 108 can present to a health care provider 128 an indication of a prescription medication based on the selecting at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience to
address the at least one attribute 120 of at least one individual.  A health care provider may include a pharmacy, a pharmaceutical company, a medical device company, a research institution, a computer software and/or computer hardware company, a
website, a nurse and/or a physician.  In some instances, presenter module 108 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Operation 2804 illustrates presenting an indication of the at least one prescription medication or the at least one artificial sensory experience at a staggered time.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, presenter module 108 may present an
indication of at least one of the at least one prescription medication or the at least one artificial sensory experience at a staggered time.  In one example, presenter module 108 can present an indication of a series of prescription medications and an
artificial sensory experience at staggered times.  A staggered time may include presenting an indication of the at least one drug and/or artificial sensory experience at overlapping times and/or at different times, including alternating times.  For
example, at least one drug and an artificial sensory experience may be administered at an initial time and the same or a different drug may be administered when the first-administered at Least one drug is at its peak effect.  In another example, at least
one drug and an artificial sensory experience may be administered at an initial time and the same or a different drug may be administered when the first administered at least one drug is at its lowest effect.  In another example, an artificial sensory
experience may be administered at an initial time and at least one prescription medication at a later time.  The at least one artificial sensory experience and/or the at Least one prescription medication may be administered at any number of times either
concurrently, partially concurrently, or not concurrently.  In some instances, presenter module 108 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 29 illustrates an operational flow 2900 representing example operations related to querying at least one database at least partly based on at least one attribute of an individual, selecting from the at least one database at Least one
prescription medication to address the at least one attribute of at Least one individual, and/or implementing at least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual in response to a selected at least
one prescription medication.  In FIG. 29, discussion and explanation may be provided with respect to the above-described examples of FIG. 1, and/or with respect to other examples and contexts.  However, it should be understood that the operational flows
may be executed in a number of other environments and contexts, and/or in modified versions of FIG. 1.  Also, although the various operational flows are presented in the sequence(s) illustrated, it should be understood that the various operations may be
performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently.
<br/><br/> After a start operation, the operational flow 2900 moves to an operation 2910.  Operation 2910 depicts querying at least one database at Least partly based on at least one attribute of an individual.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, querier
module 104 may search at Least one database at least partly based on at least one attribute of an individual.  In one instance, querier module 104 may search medication database 124 and artificial sensory experience database 126 based on an attribute 120
including an indication of hypertension associated with an individual named John Smith.  In some instances, querier module 104 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Then, operation 2920 depicts selecting from the at least one database at least one prescription medication to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select from
the at Least one database at Least one prescription medication to address the at least one attribute of at Least one individual.  In one example and continuing with the previous example, selector module 106 may select from medication database 124 and
artificial sensory experience database 126 a prescription medicine for addressing the attribute 120 including an indication of hypertension associated with an individual named John Smith.  In some instances, selector module 106 may include a computer
processor.
<br/><br/> Then, operation 2930 depicts implementing at Least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at Least one individual in response to a selected at least one prescription medication.  For example, as shown in FIG.
1, implementer module 138 may implement at least one artificial sensory experience to address the at Least one attribute of at Least one individual in response to a selected at least one prescription medication.  In one instance and continuing with the
previous example, implementer module 106 may implement an artificial sensory experience including a virtual world for addressing the attribute 120 including an indication of hypertension associated with an individual named John Smith in response to a
selected prescription medication from a medication database 124.  In some instances, selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 30 illustrates a partial view of an example computer program product 3000 that includes a computer program 3004 for executing a computer process on a computing device.  An embodiment of the example computer program product 3000 is provided

sensory experience to address the at Least one attribute of at least one individual.  The one or more instructions may be, for example, computer executable and/or Logic-implemented instructions.  In one implementation, the signal-bearing medium 3002 may
include a computer-readable medium 3006.  In one implementation, the signal bearing medium 3002 may include a recordable medium 3008.  In one implementation, the signal bearing medium 3002 may include a communications medium 3010.
<br/><br/> FIG. 31 illustrates an example system 3100 in which embodiments may be implemented.  The system 3100 includes a computing system environment.  The system 3100 also illustrates the user 118 using a device 3104, which is optionally shown as being
in communication with a computing device 3102 by way of an optional coupling 3106.  The optional coupling 3106 may represent a local, wide-area, or peer-to-peer network, or may represent a bus that is internal to a computing device (e.g., in example
embodiments in which the computing device 3102 is contained in whole or in part within the device 3104).  A storage medium 3108 may be any computer storage media.
<br/><br/> The computing device 3102 includes computer-executable instructions 3110 that when executed on the computing device 3102 cause the computing device 3102 to accept at least one attribute of at least one individual; query at least one database at
least partly based on the at least one attribute; select from the at least one database at least one prescription medication and at Least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual; and present an
indication of the at least one prescription medication and the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the selecting from the at least one database at Least one prescription medication and at Least one artificial sensory
experience to address the at least one attribute of at Least one individual.  As referenced above and as shown in FIG. 31, in some examples, the computing device 3102 may optionally be contained in whole or in part within the device 3104.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 31, then, the system 3100 includes at least one computing device (e.g., 3102 and/or 3104).  The computer-executable instructions 3110 may be executed on one or more of the at least one computing device.  For example, the computing device
3102 may implement the computer-executable instructions 3110 and output a result to (and/or receive data from) the computing device 3104.  Since the computing device 3102 may be wholly or partially contained within the computing device 3104, the device

<br/><br/> The device 3104 may include, for example, a portable computing device, workstation, or desktop computing device.  In another example embodiment, the computing device 3102 is operable to communicate with the device 3104 associated with the user
118 to receive information about the input from the user 118 for performing data access and data processing and presenting an output of the user-health test function at least partly based on the user data.
<br/><br/> Although a user 118 is shown/described herein as a single illustrated figure, those skilled in the art will appreciate that a user 118 may be representative of a human user, a robotic user (e.g., computational entity), and/or substantially any
combination thereof (e.g., a user may be assisted by one or more robotic agents).  In addition, a user 118, as set forth herein, although shown as a single entity may in fact be composed of two or more entities.  Those skilled in the art will appreciate
that, in general, the same may be said of "sender" and/or other entity-oriented terms as such terms are used herein.

<br/><br/> System 3200 generally represents instrumentality for accepting an indication of a schedule for administration of a bioactive agent to an individual, presenting an indication of an artificial sensory experience at Least partly based on the
accepting an indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual, and/or accepting an indication of at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of a bioactive agent.  The operations of accepting an
indication of a schedule for administration of a bioactive agent to an individual, presenting an indication of an artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the accepting an indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent
to the individual, and/or accepting an indication of at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of a bioactive agent may be accomplished electronically, such as with a set of interconnected electrical components, an integrated circuit,
and/or a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 36 illustrates an operational flow 3600 representing example operations related to accepting an indication of a schedule for administration of a bioactive agent to an individual and/or presenting an indication of an artificial sensory
experience at least partly based on the accepting an indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual.  In FIG. 36 and in following figures that include various examples of operational flows, discussion and
explanation may be provided with respect to the above-described examples of FIGS. 32 through 35, and/or with respect to other examples and contexts.  However, it should be understood that the operational flows may be executed in a number of other
environments and contexts, and/or in modified versions of FIGS. 32 through 35.  Also, although the various operational flows are presented in the sequence(s) illustrated, it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other
orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently.
<br/><br/> After a start operation, the operational flow 3600 moves to operation 3610.  Operation 3610 depicts accepting an indication of a schedule for administration of a bioactive agent to an individual.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35,
accepter module 3402 may accept an indication of a schedule for administration of a bioactive agent to an individual.  In one embodiment, accepter module 3402 may accept an indication of a schedule for an intravenous administration of an opioid to an
individual.  In this embodiment, the schedule may include specific times and/or methods that the bioactive agent may be administered.  For example, a time schedule may specify that an individual should receive a specific dose of morphine every two hours. In another example, an administration schedule may specify that an opioid should be administered intravenously at night and orally during waking hours.  In some instances, accepter module 3402 may include a computer processor and/or a user interface
coupled to the computer processor.
<br/><br/> Then, operation 3620 depicts presenting an indication of an artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the accepting an indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual.  For example, as shown in
FIGS. 32 through 35, presenter module 3410 may present an indication of an artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the accepting an indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual.  In one embodiment,
presenter module 3410 may present an indication of a virtual world configured for distracting an individual at least partly based on accepting an indication of a bioactive agent administration time schedule.  In this embodiment, the bioactive
administration schedule may be coordinated so that an artificial sensory experience is administered when a bioactive agent may be less effective.  Coordinating an artificial sensory experience administration schedule may serve to more efficiently
distract and/or reduce, for example, an individual's pain during a period of low bioactive agent concentration in an individual's blood.  In some instances, presenter module 3410 may include a computer processor, a display, and/or a printer.
<br/><br/> FIG. 37 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 3600 of FIG. 36.  FIG. 37 illustrates example embodiments where operation 3610 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include
operation 3702, operation 3704, and/or operation 3706.
<br/><br/> Operation 3702 illustrates accepting a bioactive agent time schedule.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, time schedule accepter module 3404 may accept a bioactive agent time schedule.  In one embodiment, accepter module 3404 may
accept a bioactive agent time schedule which specifies that an opioid, such as morphine, should be administered every two hours.  A bioactive agent time schedule may specify, for example, the exact and/or appropriate time a bioactive agent should be
administered.  Additionally, a bioactive agent time schedule may specify different bioactive agents and/or combinations of bioactive agents, delivery methods for administering a bioactive agent, and/or bioactive agent dosage.  Accepting a bioactive agent
time schedule may include accepting from a computer processor, accepting from a memory device, and/or accepting from a user input.  In one example, accepter module 3404 may accept a bioactive agent time schedule configured for printing on a medication
blister pack, such as that described in Steinnaget, U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,974,729, which is incorporated herein by reference.  In an additional example, accepter module 3404 may accept a bioactive agent time schedule from a device configured to remind an

certain time period, an artificial sensory experience configured for distracting an individual from pain may be selected for administration during that time period.  In some instances, concentration presenter module 3422 may include a computer processor
and/or a display device, such as a printer and/or a computer monitor.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 3906 illustrates recommending an artificial sensory experience administration schedule.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, recommender module 3424 may recommend an artificial sensory experience administration
schedule.  In one embodiment, recommender module 3424 may recommend a time schedule for administration of a virtual world experience.  A time schedule may be recommended by taking into account factors involving the individual and/or the bioactive agent. 
For example, efficacy of the bioactive agent versus time may be a factor, such as a time period when the bioactive agent is less effective.  Efficacy of the bioactive agent may be a factor in determining when an artificial sensory experience is
administered because of the potential for the artificial sensory experience to compensate for a changed bioactive agent efficacy.  An additional factor may include an attribute of the individual, such as how a bioactive agent and/or specific artificial
sensory experience affects the individual, for example a side effect.  Another example of recommending an artificial sensory experience may be found in Akazawa et al., U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,155,680, which is incorporated herein by reference.  In some
instances, recommender module 3424 may include a computer processor.

agent, such as morphine, affects an individual.  Utilizing pharmacodynamic software may be useful for determining an appropriate artificial sensory experience that may compensate for a period of tow bioactive agent blood concentration.  An appropriate
artificial sensory experience may compensate for reduced bioactive agent efficacy by acting as a distraction when the bioactive agent concentration may be reduced.  One example of pharmacodynamic modeling software may include GastroPlus, available from
Simulations Plus, Inc., Lancaster, Calif.  In some instances, pharmacodynamic software utilizer module 3430 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 4008 illustrates utilizing an algorithm configured for identifying a contraindication of the artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, contraindication algorithm utilizer module 3432 may
utilize an algorithm configured for identifying a contraindication of the artificial sensory experience.  A contraindication of an artificial sensory experience may include giving an indication against the advisability of the artificial sensory
experience.  For example, contraindication algorithm utilizer module 3432 may utilize an algorithm that considers an individual's personal medical history, such as a phobia, and may recommend not prescribing a certain artificial sensory experience, which
may include an object that may trigger the phobia.  Contraindication algorithm utilizer module 3432 may identify a contraindication of an artificial sensory experience for reasons such as an adverse effect and/or inefficacy.  In some instances,

acstXtreme, GNU MCSim, PK-Sim, Simcyp, and/or GastroPlus.  In some instances, software output accepter module 3468 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 48 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 4500 of FIG. 45.  FIG. 48 illustrates example embodiments where operation 4510 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include
operation 4802.
<br/><br/> Operation 4802 illustrates accepting pharmacokinetic profile information for a bioactive agent including at least one of an absorption characteristic, a distribution characteristic, a metabolization characteristic, or an excretion
characteristic.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, characteristic accepter module 3470 may accept pharmacokinetic profile information for a bioactive agent including at least one of an absorption characteristic, a distribution characteristic,
a metabolization characteristic, or an excretion characteristic.  An absorption characteristic may include a bioactive agent route of administration, the rate of dissolution of a bioactive agent, and/or ionization of a molecule.  In one embodiment,
characteristic accepter module 3470 may accept an absorption characteristic including a rate of dissolution for a medication in tablet form having an enteric coating.  A distribution characteristic may include permeability between tissues, blood flow and
perfusion rate of the tissue, pH parturition, and/or ability of the drug to bind plasma proteins and tissue.  In one embodiment, characteristic accepter module 3470 may accept a distribution characteristic for morphine, including a volume of distribution
of 3 L/kg of body weight.  A metabolization characteristic may include, for example, a metabolic rate and may include and/or be influenced by the presence of a second drug and/or compound.  Metabolization may include modification and/or degradation, for
example, by an enzyme or enzyme complex.  For example, metabolization may include modification of a first drug into a more active version of the first drug and/or a second drug.  In one embodiment, characteristic accepter module 3470 may accept a
metabolic rate for morphine.  An excretion characteristic may include an excretion rate, for example expressed in ng/mL/min. In one embodiment, characteristic accepter module 3470 may accept an excretion characteristic for morphine and/or morphine
metabolites, such as 500 ng/mL/min. In some instances, characteristic accepter module 3470 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 49 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 4500 of FIG. 45.  FIG. 49 illustrates example embodiments where operation 4510 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include
operation 4902, operation 4904, operation 4906, and/or operation 4908.
<br/><br/> Operation 4902 illustrates accepting an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile at least partly based on at least one attribute of the individual.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, attribute profile accepter module 3472 may
accepting an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile at least partly based on at least one attribute of the individual.  In one embodiment, attribute profile accepter module 3472 may accept an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile at least partly based
on age and weight of an individual.  Accepting an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile at least partly based on an attribute of the individual may serve to more accurately predict the effects of a bioactive agent on the individual by more closely
matching the individual's attributes with data from pharmaceutical tests involving people similar to the individual.  In some instances, attribute profile accepter module 3472 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 4904 illustrates accepting an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile at least partly based on at least one of renal failure, weight, hepatic failure, dehydration, sex, or age.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35,
physiological characteristic accepter module 3474 may accept an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile at least partly based on at least one of renal failure, obesity, hepatic failure, dehydration, sex, or age.  In one embodiment, physiological
characteristic accepter module 3474 may accept an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile at Least partly based on obesity and age.  Renal failure may include a situation where at least one kidney fails to properly function.  Weight may include obesity,
abnormal weight, and/or clinically underweight physiology, for example.  Obesity may include a situation where body fat accumulates to a harmful degree.  Obesity and/or abnormal weight characteristics may be measured and/or assessed using a body mass
index.  Hepatic failure may include a situation where the Liver is unable to perform its normal metabolic and/or synthetic functions.  Dehydration may include the absence and/or removal of water from the body and may negatively affect a bioactive agent
effect on an individual.  Additionally, sex and age may affect the magnitude of effect the bioactive agent may have on an individual.  For example, an elderly person may not be affected as greatly as a young person because of a slower metabolic rate.  In
some instances, physiological characteristic accepter module 3474 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 4906 illustrates accepting an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile at least partially based on a medical history.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, medical history profile accepter module 3476 may accept an
indication of a pharmacokinetic profile at least partially based on a personal medical history.  A personal medical history may include a list of previous illnesses, symptoms, medicines, treatments, health risk factors, operations, and/or doctor visits
associated with at least one individual.  In one embodiment, medical history profile accepter module 3476 may accept an indication of an individualized pharmacokinetic profile based on previously prescribed medications for an individual.  An
individualized pharmacokinetic profile may serve to more closely tailor a bioactive agent to the therapeutic needs of the individual.  For example, an individualized pharmacokinetic profile may take into account absorption rates for a certain family of
bioactive agents, such as opioids.  If the individual reacts to a first opioid, in a certain way, the individual may react to a second opioid in a similar way.  In some instances, medical history profile accepter module 3476 may include a computer
processor.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 4908 illustrates accepting an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile at least partially based on at least one attribute of a group of people.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, group attribute accepter module 3478
may accept an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile at least partially based on at least one attribute of a group of people.  In one embodiment, group attribute accepter module 3478 may accept an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile based on the
weight of a group of people where the group of people may be similar in weight to the individual.  Utilizing a pharmacokinetic profile based on a group of people with at least one similar attribute to the individual may serve to better predict how a
bioactive agent may affect the individual.  In some instances, group attribute accepter module 3478 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 50 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 4500 of FIG. 45.  FIG. 50 illustrates example embodiments where operation 4510 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include
operation 5002.
<br/><br/> Operation 5002 illustrates accepting at least one of a Tmin, Tmax, Cmin, or a Cmax value for the bioactive agent.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, parameter accepter module 3480 may accept at least one of a Tmin, Tmax, Cmin, or a
Cmax value for the bioactive agent.  A Tmin value may include a time when a bioactive agent plasma concentration is at a minimum value.  A Tmax value may include a time when a bioactive agent plasma concentration is at a maximum value.  A Cmin value may
include a minimum bioactive agent concentration value.  A Cmax value may include a maximum bioactive agent concentration value.  In one embodiment, parameter accepter module 3480 may accept a Train and a Tmax value.  Accepting a Train and a Tmax value
for a bioactive agent during a bioactive agent regimen may serve to help determine an appropriate time to administer a corresponding artificial sensory experience.  An appropriate time to administer a corresponding artificial sensory experience may
include a time period when a bioactive agent is at a low and/or minimum concentration.  An artificial sensory experience may compensate for a low and/or minimum bioactive agent concentration by serving as a distraction.  In some instances, parameter
accepter module 3480 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 51 illustrates an operational flow 5100 representing example operations related to accepting an indication of at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of a bioactive agent and an indication of a schedule for
administration of the bioactive agent to an individual and/or presenting an indication of an artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the accepting an indication of the at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of the
bioactive agent and the indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual.  In FIG. 51 and in following figures that include various examples of operational flows, discussion and explanation may be provided with
respect to the above-described examples of FIGS. 32 through 35, and/or with respect to other examples and contexts.  However, it should be understood that the operational flows may be executed in a number of other environments and contexts, and/or in
modified versions of FIGS. 32 through 35.  Also, although the various operational flows are presented in the sequence(s) illustrated, it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated,
or may be performed concurrently.
<br/><br/> After a start operation, the operational flow 5100 moves to operation 5110.  Operation 5110 depicts accepting an indication of at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of a bioactive agent and an indication of a schedule for
administration of the bioactive agent to an individual.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, accepter module 3402 may accept an indication of at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of a bioactive agent and an indication of
a schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to an individual.  In one embodiment, accepter module 3402 may accept an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile for an opioid and a schedule for an intravenous administration of the opioid to an
individual.  In this embodiment, the schedule may include specific times and/or methods that the bioactive agent may be administered.  For example, a time schedule may specify that an individual should receive a specific dose of morphine every two hours. In another example, an administration schedule may specify that an opioid should be administered intravenously at night and orally during waking hours.  In some instances, accepter module 3402 may include a computer processor and/or a user interface
coupled to the computer processor.
<br/><br/> Then, operation 5120 depicts presenting an indication of an artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the accepting an indication of the at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of the bioactive agent and the
indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, presenter module 3410 may present an indication of an artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the
accepting an indication of the at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of the bioactive agent and the indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual.  In one embodiment, presenter module 3410
may present an indication of a virtual world configured for distracting an individual at least partly based on accepting an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile for morphine and an administration time schedule.  In this embodiment, the bioactive
administration schedule may be coordinated so that an artificial sensory experience is administered when the morphine may be less effective.  Coordinating an artificial sensory experience administration schedule may serve to more efficiently distract
and/or reduce, for example, an individual's pain during a period of low bioactive agent concentration in an individual's blood.  In some instances, presenter module 3410 may include a computer processor, a display, and/or a printer.
<br/><br/> FIG. 52 illustrates an operational flow 5200 representing example operations related to accepting an indication of a bioactive agent administration for an individual, determining at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of
the bioactive agent, and/or presenting an indication of an artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the accepting an indication of the at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of the bioactive agent and the indication of
the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual.  In FIG. 52 and in following figures that include various examples of operational flows, discussion and explanation may be provided with respect to the above-described examples of
FIGS. 32 through 35, and/or with respect to other examples and contexts.  However, it should be understood that the operational flows may be executed in a number of other environments and contexts, and/or in modified versions of FIGS. 32 through 35. 
Also, although the various operational flows are presented in the sequence(s) illustrated, it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently.
<br/><br/> After a start operation, the operational flow 5200 moves to operation 5210.  Operation 5210 depicts accepting an indication of a bioactive agent administration for an individual.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, accepter module
3402 may accept an indication of a bioactive agent administration for an individual.  In one embodiment, accepter module 3402 may accept an indication of an administration of an analgesic, such as naproxen.  Accepting an indication of an administration
of a bioactive agent may include, for example, accepting an administration schedule, accepting a delivery method, and/or accepting a bioactive agent type.  In some instances, accepter module 3402 may include a computer processor and/or a user interface
coupled to the computer processor.
<br/><br/> Then, operation 5220 depicts determining at Least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of the bioactive agent.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, determiner module 3482 may determine at least one of a pharmacokinetic
or pharmacodynamic profile of the bioactive agent.  In one embodiment, determiner module 3482 may determine at least one of a pharmacokinetic profile of an analgesic, such as naproxen.  Determining at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic
profile for a bioactive agent may include using a medical history, such as a personal medical history including personal medication efficacy and/or individual attributes (gender, weight, height, etc.).  Additionally, determiner module 3482 may determine
a pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profile for a bioactive agent by comparing an individual's characteristics with predetermined computable pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profiles, for example from a database.  In some instances, determiner
module 3482 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Then, operation 5220 depicts presenting an indication of an artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the accepting an indication of the at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of the bioactive agent and the
indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, presenter module 3410 may present an indication of an artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the
accepting an indication of the at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of the bioactive agent and the indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual.  In one embodiment, presenter module 3410
may present to a computer monitor an indication of a virtual world based on accepting an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile for naproxen and an indication of an administration schedule for the naproxen.  The indication of the artificial sensory
experience may be presented, for example, by displaying the indication on a display device, such as a computer monitor, a mobile device, such as a Blackberry device, and/or a printer device, such as a printed piece of paper from a laser printer.  In some
instances, presenter module 3410 may include a computer processor and/or a display device, such as a computer monitor and/or a printer.
<br/><br/> FIG. 53 illustrates an operational flow 5300 representing example operations related to accepting an indication of at least one bioactive agent and an indication of a schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to an individual and/or
presenting an indication of an artificial sensory experience at least partly based on at least one of a pharmacokinetic profile or pharmacodynamic profile of the bioactive agent and the indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent
to the individual.  In FIG. 53 and in following figures that include various examples of operational flows, discussion and explanation may be provided with respect to the above-described examples of FIGS. 32 through 35, and/or with respect to other
examples and contexts.  However, it should be understood that the operational flows may be executed in a number of other environments and contexts, and/or in modified versions of FIGS. 32 through 35.  Also, although the various operational flows are
presented in the sequence(s) illustrated, it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently.
<br/><br/> After a start operation, the operational flow 5300 moves to operation 5310.  Operation 5310 depicts accepting an indication of at least one bioactive agent and an indication of a schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to an
individual.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, accepter module 3402 may accept an indication of at least one bioactive agent and an indication of a schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to an individual.  In one embodiment,
accepter module 3402 may accept an indication of an analgesic, such as ibuprofen, and accept an indication of an administration of the ibuprofen.  Accepting an indication of a bioactive agent may include, for example, accepting an indication of a
prescription medication from a health care provider.  Additionally, an indication of a bioactive agent may be accepted from a computer database.  Accepting an indication of a bioactive agent administration schedule may include specific times and/or
methods that the bioactive agent may be administered.  Additionally, a bioactive agent administration schedule may include receiving a dose with or without food, which may be specific food, and/or together with or separate from other drugs.  For example,
a time schedule may specify that an individual should receive a specific dose of ibuprofen every two hours.  In another example, an administration schedule may specify that an analgesic should be administered intravenously at night and orally during
waking hours.  Accepting an indication of an administration schedule may include accepting a delivery method and/or accepting a bioactive agent to be administered.  In some instances, accepter module 3402 may include a computer processor and/or a user
interface coupled to the computer processor.
<br/><br/> Then, operation 5320 depicts presenting an indication of an artificial sensory experience at Least partly based on the accepting an indication of the at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of the bioactive agent and the
indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, presenter module 3410 may present an indication of an artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the
accepting an indication of the at least one of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of the bioactive agent and the indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual.  In one embodiment, presenter module 3410
may present to a computer monitor an indication of a virtual world based on accepting an indication of a pharmacokinetic profile for ibuprofen and an indication of an administration schedule for the ibuprofen.  The indication of the artificial sensory
experience may be presented, for example, by displaying the indication on a display device, such as a computer monitor, a mobile device, such as a Blackberry device, and/or a printer device, such as a printed piece of paper from a laser printer.  In some
instances, presenter module 3410 may include a computer processor and/or a display device, such as a computer monitor and/or a printer.
<br/><br/> FIG. 54 illustrates a partial view of an example computer program product 5400 that includes a computer program 5404 for executing a computer process on a computing device.  An embodiment of the example computer program product 5400 is provided
using a signal-bearing medium bearing 5402, and may include one or more instructions for accepting an indication of a schedule for administration of a bioactive agent to an individual and one or more instructions for presenting an indication of an
artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the accepting an indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual.  The one or more instructions may be, for example, computer executable and/or
logic-implemented instructions.  In one implementation, the signal-bearing medium 5402 may include a computer-readable medium 5406.  In one implementation, the signal bearing medium 5402 may include a recordable medium 5408.  In one implementation, the
signal bearing medium 5402 may include a communications medium 5410.
<br/><br/> FIG. 55 illustrates an example system 5500 in which embodiments may be implemented.  The system 5500 includes a computing system environment.  The system 5500 also illustrates the user 118 using a device 5504, which is optionally shown as being
in communication with a computing device 5502 by way of an optional coupling 5506.  The optional coupling 5506 may represent a local, wide-area, or peer-to-peer network, or may represent a bus that is internal to a computing device (e.g., in example
embodiments in which the computing device 5502 is contained in whole or in part within the device 5504).  A storage medium 5508 may be any computer storage media.
<br/><br/> The computing device 5502 includes computer-executable instructions 5510 that when executed on the computing device 5502 cause the computing device 5502 to accept an indication of a schedule for administration of a bioactive agent to an
individual and present an indication of an artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the accepting an indication of the schedule for administration of the bioactive agent to the individual.  As referenced above and as shown in FIG. 55, in
some examples, the computing device 5502 may optionally be contained in whole or in part within the device 5504.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 55, then, the system 5500 includes at least one computing device (e.g., 5502 and/or 5504).  The computer-executable instructions 5510 may be executed on one or more of the at least one computing device.  For example, the computing device
5502 may implement the computer-executable instructions 5510 and output a result to (and/or receive data from) the computing device 5504.  Since the computing device 5502 may be wholly or partially contained within the computing device 5504, the device
5504 also may be said to execute some or all of the computer-executable instructions 5510, in order to be caused to perform or implement, for example, various ones of the techniques described herein, or other techniques.
<br/><br/> The device 5504 may include, for example, a portable computing device, workstation, or desktop computing device.  In another example embodiment, the computing device 5502 is operable to communicate with the device 5504 associated with the user
118 to receive information about the input from the user 118 for performing data access and data processing and presenting an output of the user-health test function at least partly based on the user data.
<br/><br/> Although a user 118 is shown/described herein as a single illustrated figure, those skilled in the art will appreciate that a user 118 may be representative of a human user, a robotic user (e.g., computational entity), and/or substantially any
combination thereof (e.g., a user may be assisted by one or more robotic agents).  In addition, a user 118, as set forth herein, although shown as a single entity may in fact be composed of two or more entities.  Those skilled in the art will appreciate
that, in general, the same may be said of "sender" and/or other entity-oriented terms as such terms are used herein.
<br/><br/> Following are a series of flowcharts depicting implementations.  For ease of understanding, the flowcharts are organized such that the initial flowcharts present implementations via an example implementation and thereafter the following
flowcharts present alternate implementations and/or expansions of the initial flowchart(s) as either sub-component operations or additional component operations building on one or more earlier-presented flowcharts.  Those having skill in the art will
appreciate that the style of presentation utilized herein (e.g., beginning with a presentation of a flowchart(s) presenting an example implementation and thereafter providing additions to and/or further details in subsequent flowcharts) generally allows
for a rapid and easy understanding of the various process implementations.  In addition, those skilled in the art will further appreciate that the style of presentation used herein also lends itself well to modular and/or object-oriented program design
paradigms.
<br/><br/> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the foregoing specific exemplary processes and/or devices and/or technologies are representative of more general processes and/or devices and/or technologies taught elsewhere herein, such as in the
claims filed herewith and/or elsewhere in the present application.
<br/><br/> Those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction Left between hardware, software, and/or firmware implementations of aspects of systems; the use of hardware,
software, and/or firmware is generally (but not always, in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant) a design choice representing cost vs.  efficiency tradeoffs.  Those having skill in the art will
appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and/or systems and/or other technologies described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and/or firmware), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the
processes and/or systems and/or other technologies are deployed.  For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and/or firmware vehicle; alternatively, if flexibility is
paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and/or firmware.  Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes
and/or devices and/or other technologies described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific
concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary.  Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will typically employ optically-oriented hardware, software, and or
firmware.
<br/><br/> In some implementations described herein, logic and similar implementations may include software or other control structures suitable to operation.  Electronic circuitry, for example, may manifest one or more paths of electrical current
constructed and arranged to implement various logic functions as described herein.  In some implementations, one or more media are configured to bear a device-detectable implementation if such media hold or transmit a special purpose device instruction
set operable to perform as described herein.  In some variants, for example, this may manifest as an update or other modification of existing software or firmware, or of gate arrays or other programmable hardware, such as by performing a reception of or
a transmission of one or more instructions in relation to one or more operations described herein.  Alternatively or additionally, in some variants, an implementation may include special-purpose hardware, software, firmware components, and/or
general-purpose components executing or otherwise invoking special-purpose components.  Specifications or other implementations may be transmitted by one or more instances of tangible transmission media as described herein, optionally by packet
transmission or otherwise by passing through distributed media at various times.
<br/><br/> Alternatively or additionally, implementations may include executing a special-purpose instruction sequence or otherwise invoking circuitry for enabling, triggering, coordinating, requesting, or otherwise causing one or more occurrences of any
functional operations described above.  In some variants, operational or other logical descriptions herein may be expressed directly as source code and compiled or otherwise invoked as an executable instruction sequence, in some contexts, for example,
C++ or other code sequences can be compiled directly or otherwise implemented in high-level descriptor languages (e.g., a logic-synthesizable language, a hardware description language, a hardware design simulation, and/or other such similar mode(s) of
expression).  Alternatively or additionally, some or all of the logical expression may be manifested as a Verilog-type hardware description or other circuitry model before physical implementation in hardware, especially for basic operations or
timing-critical applications.  Those skilled in the art will recognize how to obtain, configure, and optimize suitable transmission or computational elements, material supplies, actuators, or other common structures in light of these teachings.

<br/><br/> Those skilled in the art will recognize that at least a portion of the devices and/or processes described herein can be integrated into a data processing system.  Those having skill in the art will recognize that a data processing system
generally includes one or more of a system unit housing, a video display device, memory such as volatile or non-volatile memory, processors such as microprocessors or digital signal processors, computational entities such as operating systems, drivers,
graphical user interfaces, and applications programs, one or more interaction devices (e.g., a touch pad, a touch screen, an antenna, etc.), and/or control systems including feedback Loops and control motors (e.g., feedback for sensing position and/or
velocity; control motors for moving and/or adjusting components and/or quantities).  A data processing system may be implemented utilizing suitable commercially available components, such as those typically found in data computing/communication and/or
network computing/communication systems.
<br/><br/> Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to implement devices and/or processes and/or systems, and thereafter use engineering and/or other practices to integrate such implemented devices and/or processes and/or
systems into more comprehensive devices and/or processes and/or systems.  That is, at least a portion of the devices and/or processes and/or systems described herein can be integrated into other devices and/or processes and/or systems via a reasonable
amount of experimentation.  Those having skill in the art will recognize that examples of such other devices and/or processes and/or systems might include--as appropriate to context and application--all or part of devices and/or processes and/or systems
of (a) an air conveyance (e.g., an airplane, rocket, helicopter, etc.), (b) a ground conveyance (e.g., a car, truck, locomotive, tank, armored personnel carrier, etc.), (c) a building (e.g., a home, warehouse, office, etc.), (d) an appliance (e.g., a
refrigerator, a washing machine, a dryer, etc.), (e) a communications system (e.g., a networked system, a telephone system, a Voice over IP system, etc.), (f) a business entity (e.g., an Internet Service Provider (ISP) entity such as Comcast Cable,
Qwest, Southwestern Bell, etc.), or (g) a wired/wireless services entity (e.g., Sprint, Cingular, Nextel, etc.), etc.
<br/><br/> In certain cases, use of a system or method may occur in a territory even if components are Located outside the territory.  For example, in a distributed computing context, use of a distributed computing system may occur in a territory even
though parts of the system may be located outside of the territory (e.g., relay, server, processor, signal-bearing medium, transmitting computer, receiving computer, etc. located outside the territory).
<br/><br/> A sale of a system or method may likewise occur in a territory even if components of the system or method are located and/or used outside the territory.
<br/><br/> Further, implementation of at least part of a system for performing a method in one territory does not preclude use of the system in another territory.
<br/><br/> All of the above U.S.  patents, U.S.  patent application publications, U.S.  patent applications, foreign patents, foreign patent applications and non-patent publications referred to in this specification and/or listed in any Application Data
Sheet, are incorporated herein by reference, to the extent not inconsistent herewith.
<br/><br/> One skilled in the art will recognize that the herein described components (e.g., operations), devices, objects, and the discussion accompanying them are used as examples for the sake of conceptual clarity and that various configuration
modifications are contemplated.  Consequently, as used herein, the specific exemplars set forth and the accompanying discussion are intended to be representative of their more general classes.  In general, use of any specific exemplar is intended to be
representative of its class, and the non-inclusion of specific components (e.g., operations), devices, and objects should not be taken limiting.
<br/><br/> Although user 118 is shown/described herein as a single illustrated figure, those skilled in the art will appreciate that user 118 may be representative of a human user, a robotic user (e.g., computational entity), and/or substantially any
combination thereof (e.g., a user may be assisted by one or more robotic agents) unless context dictates otherwise.  Those skilled in the art will appreciate that, in general, the same may be said of "sender" and/or other entity-oriented terms as such
terms are used herein unless context dictates otherwise.
<br/><br/> With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or
application.  The various singular/plural permutations are not expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.
<br/><br/> The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components.  It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many
other architectures may be implemented which achieve the same functionality.  In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively "associated" such that the desired functionality is achieved.  Hence, any
two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as "associated with" each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components.  Likewise, any two components so
associated can also be viewed as being "operably connected", or "operably coupled," to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being "operably couplable," to each other
to achieve the desired functionality.  Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and/or physically interacting components, and/or wirelessly interactable, and/or wirelessly interacting components, and/or
logically interacting, and/or logically interactable components.
<br/><br/> In some instances, one or more components may be referred to herein as "configured to," "configurable to," "operable/operative to," "adapted/adaptable," "able to," "conformable/conformed to," etc. Those skilled in the art will recognize that
"configured to" can generally encompass active-state components and/or inactive-state components and/or standby-state components, unless context requires otherwise.
<br/><br/> While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing
from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. 
It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as "open" terms (e.g., the term "including" should be interpreted as
"including but not limited to," the term "having" should be interpreted as "having at least," the term "includes" should be interpreted as "includes but is not limited to," etc.).  It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific
number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present.  For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may
contain usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim recitations.  However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or an
limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to claims containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "an"
(e.g., "a" and/or "an" should typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.  In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim
recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers, typically means
at Least two recitations, or two or more recitations).  Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, and C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would
understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at Least one of A, B, and C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.).  In
those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, or C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at Least one of A, B,
or C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.).  It will be further understood by those within the art that typically a
disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms unless
context dictates otherwise.  For example, the phrase "A or B" will be typically understood to include the possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B."
<br/><br/> With respect to the appended claims, those skilled in the art wilt appreciate that recited operations therein may generally be performed in any order.  Also, although various operational flows are presented in a sequence(s), it should be
understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently.  Examples of such alternate orderings may include overlapping, interleaved, interrupted, reordered, incremental,
preparatory, supplemental, simultaneous, reverse, or other variant orderings, unless context dictates otherwise.  Furthermore, terms like "responsive to," "related to," or other past-tense adjectives are generally not intended to exclude such variants,
unless context dictates otherwise.
<br/><br/> While various aspects and embodiments have been disclosed herein, other aspects and embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art.  The various aspects and embodiments disclosed herein are for purposes of illustration and are not
intended to be limiting, with the true scope and spirit being indicated by the following claims.
