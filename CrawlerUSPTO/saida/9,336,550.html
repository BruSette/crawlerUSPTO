       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A computer implemented method and a sales management system (SMS) for
     generating sales through interactive digital content (IDC) integrate
     multiple electronic commerce service providers (ECSPs) for facilitating
     purchase of multiple sale items from within digital media. The SMS
     preferably inserts an indicator element at a predefined location within
     the IDC in the digital media that, when activated, invokes a display of
     multiple sale item indicators. When a sale item indicator is activated,
     the SMS retrieves sale item information associated with the sale item,
     and selects an ECSP for completing the purchase of the sale item. The SMS
     displays a dynamic interactive display element (DIDE) linked to the
     activated sale item indicator. The DIDE displays sale item information
     and provides direct purchasing options. The SMS renders a content display
     interface associated with the selected ECSP based on a selection of one
     of the purchasing options for initiating purchase of the sale item.

<br/><br/> The invention relates to a computer method and system for generating purchases of sales items, and more particularly, to a method and sales management system which generates sales through interactive digital content on a consumer device.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Computers and consumer devices have become increasingly more advanced, allowing consumers to do more things, in more places, and in less time.  Consumers have regularly used various consumer devices to purchase sale items on the internet and
engage in electronic commerce (e-commerce).  In a conventional online shopping environment, a consumer would see an advertisement for a sale item, for example through one web site, navigate or be redirected to another website offering the sale item, such
as a vendor web site having various items for sale, find the sale item on that website or be directed to a particular web page relating to the sale item of interest, add the sale item to a shopping cart, confirm shipping and billing details, and then
purchase the sale item through the vendor web site.  This type of purchasing process requires substantial time and interaction on the part of the consumer, and as a result has a high abandonment rate.  As the current advertising methods are inefficient,
a relatively small percentage of digital advertisements lead to consumer purchases.  Further, vendors or retailers should remain challenged to generate sales growth in a weak economic environment.  In their quest for sales growth, among other things,
vendors must reassess the effectiveness of their various marketing strategies.
<br/><br/> Product placement has played a key role in advertising for decades.  For example, moving images, such as a television show or a movie can potentially contain dynamic advertisements.  Similarly, mediums such as digital newspapers and digital
magazines are utilized for providing advertisements.  For example, a digital article in an architectural magazine may show a photograph illustrating the design of a room in connection with an article about the building in which the room exists.  It may
not be common for such an article to include the particulars of all the sale items shown in the photograph, since the article is about the building.  Certain sale items in the photograph may be labeled and can be easily referenced and found by the
consumer, for example, through search engines or through vendor information shown in the graphics of the article which helps the shopper browse a vendor web site and research a sales item.  However, there are hundreds of sale items advertised in digital
media that do not have labels visually associated with them which make it difficult or even impossible for the average consumer to find out who made these sale items or how to purchase them.
<br/><br/> A study by Adobe.RTM.  Digital Index (ADI) of Adobe Systems Incorporated has shown that static advertising is not overly effective in generating sales whereas interactive digital advertising is substantially more effective.  Interactive digital
advertising allows interaction between a prospective consumer and the digital device on which the digital advertising is displayed.  Some websites that offer sale items have attempted to streamline the online shopping process by providing dynamic
advertisements linking the sale items contained therein to third party websites where the sale items can be researched and purchased.  Such linking can be achieved via individual hyperlinks for each sale item or product in the dynamic advertisement.  For
example, consider an image displayed in a digital newspaper comprising multiple purchasable sale items linked to individual sites where each sale item can be purchased from.  A consumer may be able to mouse over an image of a specific sale item that
he/she is interested in and be directly linked to that particular sale item by clicking on the image of the sale item.  Multiple hyperlinks can be provided which allow the shopper to redirect to multiple web pages or web sites.  Each sales item might
need to be researched one at a time.  An editorial picture in an article can thus be dynamically transformed into an advertisement that provides multiple purchasable goods.  This can therefore allow almost any photograph to be turned into an
advertisement, and allow the photograph to convey whatever original meaning was intended.
<br/><br/> However, a hyperlink causes the consumer to leave the primary digital media they are viewing, such as a web site on their digital device, to visit the vendor's secondary or remote website through which details on the item can be viewed and the
purchase can be made.  If the digital media is being viewed in a separate application, for example, a news reader, clicking on the hyperlink requires launching and switching to a browser, which can take considerable time, resources, and patience on the
part of the consumer.  Ultimately, the consumer may have to open multiple applications or web sites to view the primary digital media and shop for the various sales items, and when completed, then the consumer must find and return to the original digital
media application to continue their activities.  Therefore, such an option takes or redirects the consumer away from the original digital media they are viewing, which can deter the consumer from making the purchase or can pull the consumer away from the
digital media and the associated advertisements and reduce the possibility of additional purchases.  Hence, there is a need to improve the display of sale item information on a consumer device and improve the initiation of a transaction for the sale item
without detracting from the original digital media.
<br/><br/> Hence, there is a long felt but unresolved need for a computer implemented method and a sales management system that improve the display of interactive digital content within digital media on a consumer device, promote shopping and transactions
for sale items without detracting from the digital media, and generate sales through the interactive digital content within the digital media.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further disclosed in the detailed description of the invention.  This summary is not intended to identify key or essential inventive concepts of the
claimed subject matter, nor is it intended for determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.
<br/><br/> Generally, the invention relates to an improved method and sales management system that promotes the marketing and sale of items directly through a consumer's digital device.  With the present invention, the consumer can use their digital device
for normal activities that do not necessarily involve shopping for sales items, but the digital media may display various sales items within the digital media.  For example, a digital article or advertising may include graphics such as photos or text
that include or reference a variety of items that are available for sale.  In this regard, an advertisement or article might include a picture of a model using or wearing a variety of different items from different vendors, wherein a number of these
items are available for purchase.  To minimize distracting the consumer from the original activity while still promoting and marketing the sales item, each sales item preferably is displayed with a sales indicator that is not obtrusive but can be
activated by the consumer to prominently display additional information about the sales item.  It will be understood that all items do not need a respective sales item associated therewith.  Instead, a single sales item might be associated with the
digital media, such as a single sales item indicator located close to a collection or group of sales items displayed in the digital media Essentially, the sales item indicator functions to draw the consumer's interest to the point that the consumer
decides to activate the sales item indicator, view detailed information on the sales item, and ultimately, purchase the sales item.  Preferably, the system includes a primary indicator element to toggle the individual sales item indicator(s) on or off,
although the invention also may display the sales item indicator(s) continuously.  The sales item indicators serve as non-obtrusive prompts that indicate to the consumer that the particular item being displayed is available for sale, and if their
interest is piqued, the consumer can quickly and directly display information on the sales item while still being able to quickly and conveniently return to their original activity once their interest wanes or more preferably, once a purchase is
completed.  This system and the additional features disclosed herein represent an improved method and system for promoting and marketing sales items.
<br/><br/> More particularly, the computer implemented method and sales management system disclosed herein address the above stated needs for improving the display of interactive digital content within digital media on a consumer device by providing
several features so that a consumer can readily identify sales items and if interested, easily research multiple sales items while remaining within the display area of the digital device.  By consolidating the shopping experience within the digital media
display area, the invention is more likely to initiate transactions for sale items without detracting from the digital media, and generate sales through use of the interactive digital content directly within the original digital media being reviewed. 
The computer implemented method disclosed herein employs the sales management system of the present invention, which system comprises at least one processor configured to execute computer program instructions to improve the format and function of the
digital media being used by a potential purchaser.  The digital media is significantly improved for generating sales through the interactive digital content contained within digital media on the consumer device.  The sales management system displays the
digital media comprising the interactive digital content on the consumer device via a graphical user interface (GUI) used with the sales management system.
<br/><br/> The computer implemented method disclosed herein dynamically integrates one or more electronic commerce service providers, who offer various sale items to a consumer for purchase from a variety of vendors.  Ultimately, the sales management
system facilitates the viewing of multiple sale items directly from within the digital media without redirecting the consumer to separate web pages or web sites operated by the electronic commerce service provider until the purchasing step when the
decision to purchase has been made.  The interactive digital content promotes sale items that are available for purchase from within the digital media displayed on the consumer device and the consumer may select any of these items for purchase from an
electronic commerce service provider.  Additionally, each sale item may be mapped to one or more related sale items provided by the electronic commerce service provider to promote secondary purchases of related sales items.
<br/><br/> To help identify the sales items contained within the digital media, the sales management system preferably inserts an indicator element at a predefined location within the interactive digital content in the digital media.  The indicator element
is displayed on the consumer device and visible to the consumer who may selectively activate the indicator element to toggle on and display multiple sale item indicators associated with respective sale items viewable within the digital media.  When the
indicator element is activated, the sales management system displays each of the sale item indicators positioned proximal or close to a respective one of the sale items wherein the sales items can be seen within the interactive digital content in the
digital media on the consumer device via the GUI.  While a user may start by viewing an article or advertisement, activation of the main indicator element then shows the user what visible articles are actually sales items available for purchase.  When
the various sales item indicators are toggled on or otherwise visible, each sale item indicator is associated with one or more sale items to indicate and show what sales items are available for purchase from within the interactive digital content in the
digital media on the consumer device.  If the consumer is interested, the consumer in turn may activate or select one of the sale item indicators associated with one or more of the sale items through interaction with the interactive digital content. 
Upon activation, the sales management system retrieves sale item information associated with that sale item and selects one of the electronic commerce service providers, which supplies the information necessary for completing the purchase of the sale
item if the consumer decides to make such a purchase.
<br/><br/> When the sale item indicator is activated by the consumer, the sales management system displays a dynamic interactive display element linked to the activated sale item indicator wherein the interactive display element is displayed directly
within the digital media on the consumer device.  There is no linking or redirection to another web site to review this information and make a purchasing decision.  Rather, the dynamic interactive display element displays the retrieved sale item
information and provides purchasing options for facilitating purchase of the sale item.  The consumer can select one or more of the purchasing options.  At this stage, the sales management system renders a content display interface, for example, a web
page of a website associated with the selected electronic commerce service provider, although the content display interface is rendered within the dynamic interactive display element based on the selection of one or more of the purchasing options.  The
content display interface is provided for initiating purchase of the sale item from within the dynamic interactive display element and thereby generating sales through the interactive digital content within the digital media.
<br/><br/> In one or more various aspects, related systems include but are not limited to circuitry and/or programming for effecting the herein-referenced method aspects; the circuitry and/or programming can be virtually any combination of hardware,
software, and/or firmware configured to effect the herein-referenced method aspects depending upon the design choices of the system designer.  Also, various structural elements may be employed depending on design choices of the system designer.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> For a general understanding of the present invention, FIGS. 1A-1D comprise exemplary screenshots showing the method and system of the present invention.  In this regard, the invention relates to an improved method and sales management system 10
that promotes the marketing and sale of items 11 directly through a consumer's digital device 12.  FIG. 1A shows the digital device 12 with a graphical user interface (GUI) 14 such as a display screen which illustrates digital media 15 that can be
displayed in many different forms as described in more detail herein.  With the present invention, a consumer can use their digital device 12 for normal activities that do not necessarily involve shopping for sales items 11 such as surfing web pages or
reading digital articles, blogs, catalogs and the like.  While using the digital device 12 for these normal activities, the digital media 15 may display various sales items 11 within the digital media 15.  For example, a digital article or advertising
may include graphics such as photos that include a variety of items 11 that are available for sale.  The digital article may also include text that references sale items 11.  FIG. 1A shows a screenshot from a digital article that includes a picture of a
model using or wearing a variety of different items, which can be supplied from different vendors, wherein the item 11 is available for purchase.  In this example, the item 11 is a helmet.  To minimize distracting the consumer from the original activity
while still promoting and marketing the sales item 11, the sales item 11 is displayed with a sales item indicator 17 that is not obtrusive but can be activated by the consumer to display additional information about the sales item 11.  Therefore, the
sales item indicator 17 functions to catch the consumer's interest to the point that the consumer decides to activate the sales indicator 17, view detailed information on the sales item 11, and ultimately, purchase the sales item 11.  Preferably, the
system 10 includes a primary indicator element 18 to toggle the individual sales indicator(s) 17 on or off, although the invention also may display the sales indicator(s) 17 continuously.  Each sales indicator 17 serves as a non-obtrusive prompt that
indicates or signals to the consumer that the particular item 11 being displayed is available for sale, and if their interest is piqued, the consumer can quickly and directly display information on the sales item 11 while still being able to quickly and
conveniently return to their original activity in the digital media 12 once their interest wanes or more preferably, once a purchase is completed.  This system 10 and the additional features disclosed herein represent an improved method and system for
promoting and marketing sales items.
<br/><br/> In more detail, FIGS. 1A-1D illustrate exemplary screenshots of the GUI 14 provided by the sales management system 10 exemplarily illustrated in following FIGS. 2-9, for generating sales through interactive digital content 19 within the digital
media 15.  FIG. 1A exemplarily illustrates a screenshot of the GUI 14 displaying digital media 15, for example, a digital magazine which includes a digital article on skiing.  The digital media 15 comprises interactive digital content 19, which includes
one or more sale items 11.  For example, FIG. 1A shows a digital article showing a digital image of a skier wearing the sale item 11 such as a helmet 11 in this example.  It will be understood that these exemplary screenshots could include a variety of
different sales items 11 such as the gloves, ski poles, skis, boots, etc. The sales management system 10 disclosed herein enhances sales success of digital magazine advertisements by facilitating purchase of the sale item 11 directly from within the
digital magazine itself.  The sales management system 10 may display various sale items 11 in a particular presentation of the interactive digital content 19, which thereby provides vendors with an innovative vehicle to not only showcase a variety of
primary sales items 11 displayed in the specific digital media advertisements as seen in FIG. 1A, but also showcase additional related sale items 21 as seen in FIG. 1B, which vendors believe are appropriate.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 1A and 1B, the sales management system 10 preferably embeds the indicator element 18 at any predefined location in the GUI 14 to allow the consumer to toggle the sales items indicator(s) 17 on and off.  For example, the
indicator element 18 is displayed as a "P" icon, in the digital article which on activation by the consumer invokes the display of a respective sale item indicator 17 positioned proximal to the helmet 11.  If there are multiple sale items 17 on display,
a respective number of sale item indicators 17 preferably are displayed when the indicator element 18 is activated.  When a consumer clicks on the "P" icon 18 with a mouse, touchscreen, touchpad or the like, the system 10 displays the sale item indicator
17 next to the helmet 11 which indicates to the consumer that the helmet 11 is purchasable through the interactive digital content 19.  While one sales item indicator 17 is preferably associated with a single sales item 11, a single sale item indicator
17 also might be associated with a group or collection of sales items 11 being displayed.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 1B, when the consumer clicks on a selected sale item indicator 17, the system 10 retrieves related sale items 21 and sale item details associated with the sale item 11 using a sale item identifier of the sale item 11, the
vendor identifier of the vendor who is selling the sale item 11, and the vendor configuration settings configured by the vendor in accord with the disclosure herein.  The system 10 coordinates with any number of electronic commerce service providers 23
(FIG. 2) who offer the various sales items 11 for sale through the interactive digital content 19.  As used herein, "electronic commerce service provider" 23 refers to an entity, for example, Amazon.RTM.  of Amazon Technologies, Inc., eBay.RTM.  of eBay,
Inc., etc., that facilitates interactive electronic commerce transactions between buyers and sellers.  Generally, the system 10 determines an electronic commerce service provider 23, for example, Amazon.RTM.  for completing the purchase of the sale item
11 based on the retrieved vendor configuration settings, the retrieved sale item identifier, and the retrieved vendor identifier.  The sales item detail will either be obtained from server-based storage or from the electronic commerce service provider
23.  The system 10 further retrieves inventory information comprising, for example, the size and quantity values from the Amazon.RTM.  database.
<br/><br/> More particularly as to the example seen in FIG. 1B, when the sales item indicator 17 is clicked or otherwise activated, a dynamic interactive digital element 24 is displayed on the GUI 14.  The dynamic interactive digital element 24, for
example, preferably is displayed in the form of a dynamic lightbox 24 that displays the retrieved sale item information.  The dynamic lightbox 24 lists the sale item information about the sale item 11, for example, the name 25 of the sale item 11, brief
details 26 about the sale item 11, high resolution images 27 of the sale item 11, reviews 28, quantity or number of units available 29, and a size button 30 to show available sizes.  The dynamic lightbox 24 provides a sale item details button 31, a sale
item review button 32, a video button 33, an "add to" cart button 34, and a purchase button 35.  The sale item details button 31 when clicked or otherwise selected displays a pop up window showing a description about the sale item 11.  The sale item
review button 32 when clicked displays a pop up window showing reviews written by other consumers who have purchased the sale item 11.  The video button 33 when clicked displays a pop up window showing a video of the sale item 11.  The "add to" cart
button 34 when clicked adds the sale item 11 to the shopping cart.  The purchase button when clicked redirects to the determined electronic commerce service provider 23, that is, Amazon.RTM.  in the exemplary scenario.  When the consumer clicks on the
image of the sale item 11, the system 10 displays an enlarged image 27 of the sale item 11.  The size dropdown option includes the size button 30 that displays a dropdown list of available sizes when clicked wherein the individual sizes can be selected
to allow the consumer to select a particular size of the sale item 11 that the consumer requires.
<br/><br/> Also, when the sales item indicator 17 is activated, the system 10 not only displays the primary sales item 11, such as the helmet, but also shows related sales items 21 which have some nexus or relationship to the sales item 11.  The
relationship could be determined by the system 10 itself or preferably by agreement with the vendors.  In the lightbox 24, the lightbox 24 includes related sales item boxes 36 for all of the related sale items 21, for example, skiing boots 37, goggles
38, skis 39, etc., which are displayed at the bottom of the dynamic lightbox 24 as thumbnails within the related sales item boxes 36.  The dynamic lightbox 24 displays more related sale items 21 when the consumer performs a left swipe motion or a right
swipe motion in the related sale items section.  When the consumer clicks on one of the related sale items 21 displayed in the boxes 36 in the related sale items section 40, the system 10 provides detailed information about the selected related sale item
21 in lightbox 24.
<br/><br/> If the consumer clicks on the add to cart button 34, then the helmet 11 is added to the shopping cart 41 as seen in FIG. 1C.  All the other sale items 11 that the consumer wants to purchase are also added to the shopping cart 41 and displayed as
selected sales items 42.  A toolbar 43 is included to provide shortcut links to frequently used controls, for example, a settings menu, the shopping cart 41, etc. When the consumer clicks on the shopping cart icon or shopping bag icon 44 on the toolbar
43, the shopping cart 41 is displayed within the dynamic interactive digital element or dynamic lightbox 24 showing all the sale items 11 or related sales items 21 that the consumer has added to the shopping cart 41 as selected sales items 42 as
exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 1C.  If the consumer decides to proceed and purchase the helmet 11 by clicking on the final purchase button 35, the consumer is then routed to an electronic commerce service provider 23 such as Amazon.RTM.  as exemplarily
illustrated in FIG. 1D.
<br/><br/> Preferably as seen in FIG. 1C, the shopping cart 41 displays the sale items 42 in a table format comprising rows and columns.  For example, the shopping cart 41 exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 1C shows the 5.sup.th computer code view comprising
3 items on vertical view and 3 items on horizontal view listed in each row wherein the consumer can scroll top and bottom or side to side if there are more selected items 42 than would fit in the lightbox 24, that is, when there are many selected sale
items 42 in the shopping cart 41.  The system 10 allows the consumer to edit size and quantity of each selected sale item 42 in the shopping cart 41 and select one or more sale items 42 for immediate purchase.  As a default option, all the selected sale
items 42 in the shopping cart 41 will be selected, that is, the item checkbox 45 next to the sale item 42 is checked and the consumer can uncheck the checkbox 45 to avoid purchasing that particular sale item 42 from the shopping cart 41 at the time of
purchase.  However, the unchecked sales item 42 can remain in the shopping cart 41, which essentially serves as a wishlist of sales items 42.  The consumer can change quantity 46 and size 47 before checkout.  At least one size 47 and one quantity 46 of
the sale item 11 should be selected by the consumer.  The system 10 automatically updates the shopping cart 41 based on the consumer selections of the sale items 11, the quantity option, and the size option.  If the consumer wishes to delete a selected
sales item 42 from the shopping cart 41, a delete button 41A is provided near each sales item 42, which button 41A can be activated to delete the unwanted sales item 42 from the shopping cart 41.  The shopping cart 41 provides an option to save the
changes and close the shopping cart window by displaying an "X" icon in a corner of the shopping cart window within the dynamic lightbox 24.  The shopping cart 41 also provides a checkout button 48 in the top corner of the window that allows the consumer
to check out the selected sale items 42 that have box 45 checked, and at this time, redirects the consumer to the electronic commerce service provider 23 such as the Amazon.RTM.  website as exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 1D.  The Amazon.RTM.  website 49
is loaded in the dynamic lightbox 24 within the digital magazine and the consumer can continue the purchase through the Amazon.RTM.  website or other electronic commerce service provider 23.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, with the present invention, a consumer can use their digital device 12 for normal activities that do not necessarily involve shopping for sales items 11 such as surfing web pages or reading digital articles, blogs, catalogs and the
like.  While using the digital device 12 for these normal activities, the digital media 15 may display the various sales items 11 within the digital media 15 and provide the indicator element 18 to toggle on the individual sales item indicator(s) 17.  If
the consumer is interested in any particular sales items 11, the consumer can quickly and readily research the sales items 11 directly from the interactive digital content 19 without being directed away from their primary activity on the digital device
12.  The consumer can even reach the point of filling a shopping cart 41, selecting quantity 46 and size 47, and clicking the checkout button 48 before being redirected to the electronic commerce service provider 49 to complete the final purchase.  At
any time, the consumer may decide not to purchase any item, and will be quickly returned to their primary activity on the digital device 12 by closing out the interactive digital element, such as the lightbox 24.  By minimizing the diversion and
complexity of the shopping and purchasing process, the consumer may be more likely to complete quick and simple purchases, and then return to their original activity such as reading an article in a digital magazine.
<br/><br/> The following provides a more detailed discussion of the invention and how it implements the above-described method and system features.  FIG. 2 illustrates the computer implemented method for generating sales through the interactive digital
content 19 provided within digital media 15.  As used herein, "digital media" refers to a form of electronic media comprising digitized content that can be transmitted over computer networks or the internet.  The digital media 15 comprises, for example,
digital magazines, digital articles, digital newspapers, digital videos, digital images, electronic books, video games, etc. Also, as used herein, "interactive digital content" refers to marketing communication data, for example, an advertisement in a
digital format that is utilized by vendors to convey a message that encourages, persuades, or prompts consumers to perform an action, for example, purchase sale items 11.  The interactive digital content 19 comprises, for example, digital advertisements
with interactive graphics which are provided as part of the digital media 15.  Also, as used herein, "sale item" refers to a commodity, for example, information, a product, a service, etc. In one example in which the present invention is used, the
digital media 15 might be a digital magazine having a digital article which contains an advertisement displaying the sale items 11 available for sale.
<br/><br/> The computer implemented method disclosed herein relates to such digital media 15, and more particularly to product cataloging and product indications used in digital advertising wherein the method promotes purchasing of products by consumers
through the interactive digital content 19 provided within the digital media 15.  The computer implemented method disclosed herein employs a sales management system generally designated by reference numeral 10 in FIG. 2.  The sales management system 10
comprises at least one processor configured to execute computer program instructions for generating sales of sale items 11 through the interactive digital content 19 within the digital media 15 as will be described in further detail herein relative to
FIGS. 3-9.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 2, the sales management system 10 comprises a digital media application 50 (FIG. 3) that provides robust features which display advertised sales items 11 and related sale items 21 as selected by vendors in a consumer friendly
configuration wherein consumers can readily view the sale items 11 and related sale items 21 to facilitate the purchase thereof.  As used herein, the term "consumer" refers to a buyer, for example, a customer, an individual, an organization, etc., that
wants to purchase a sale item 11 from an electronic commerce service provider 23.  Also, as used herein, the term "vendor" refers to a seller, for example, an individual dealer, a retailer, an outlet, a company, a supplier, etc., that offers various sale
items for sale to one or more consumers via the interactive digital content 19 within the digital media 15 of the present invention.  The digital media application 50 allows consumers to purchase advertised sale items 11 without leaving the digital
platform on which the interactive digital content 19 is being viewed.  This avoids the necessity of linking the interactive digital content 19 to third party web sites and redirecting purchasers to the third party web sites when they are still
considering whether to purchase a sales item 11 or related sales item 21.  The digital media application 50 presents the sale items 11 and related sale items 21 in a controlled messaging environment directly through the interactive digital media 19,
which offers a streamlined cart and/or purchasing process.  The direct connections provided by the digital media application 50, enable consumers to visit the electronic commerce service provider 23, view various sale items 11, and complete multiple
purchases while remaining on the digital media application 50.  The sales management system 10 of the present invention enables vendors to realize meaningful, immediate increased sales activity that substantially improves the return on their advertising
expenditure.
<br/><br/> In more detail, FIG. 2 illustrates the sales management system 10 for generating sales through the interactive digital content 19 within the digital media 15.  The sales management system 10 disclosed herein is configured to enhance product
familiarity and sales through use of interactive digital content 19, for example, digital advertisements within the digital media 15 on the consumer's digital device 12.  Multiple sale items 11, for example, products or services are showcased through a
single dynamic interactive display element 24, for example, the dynamic lightbox which provides both in-depth information and purchasing options for the advertised sale item(s) 11.  The sales management system 10 disclosed herein provides a unique
service that allows vendors or advertisers to guide consumers to several points of product purchase rather than having to rely on one single static advertisement.
<br/><br/> The sales management system 10 comprises the digital media application 50 and a sales management server 51.  The digital media application 50 is executable by at least one processor and is configured as a software application downloadable on a
consumer device 12 via a network 52.  The network 52 is, for example, the internet, an intranet, a wired network, a wireless network, a network that implements Wi-Fi.RTM.  of the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance, Inc., an ultra-wideband
communication network (UWB), a wireless universal serial bus (USB) communication network, a communication network that implements ZigBee.RTM.  of ZigBee Alliance Corporation, a general packet radio service (GPRS) network, a mobile telecommunication
network such as a global system for mobile (GSM) communications network, a code division multiple access (CDMA) network, a third generation (3G) mobile communication network, a fourth generation (4G) mobile communication network, a long-term evolution
(LTE) mobile communication network, a public telephone network, etc., a local area network, a wide area network, an internet connection network, an infrared communication network, etc., or a network formed from any combination of these networks.
<br/><br/> The digital media application 50 communicates with the sales management server 51 via the network 52.  The processor is communicatively coupled to a non-transitory computer readable storage medium.  The non-transitory computer readable storage
medium stores computer program instructions defined by modules 50a, 50b, etc., of the digital media application 50.  The processor is configured to execute the defined computer program instructions.  As used herein, the phrase "non-transitory computer
readable storage medium" refers to all computer readable media, for example, non-volatile media such as optical discs or magnetic disks, volatile media such as a register memory, a processor cache, etc., and transmission media such as wires that
constitute a system bus coupled to the processor, except for a transitory, propagating signal.  The digital media application 50 comprises a graphical user interface (GUI) 14 such as that described above; a media display module 50a, and an indicator
management module 50b, which are implemented in device code on the server side.  The sales management server 51 comprises a dynamic integration module 51a and an information retrieval module 51b.
<br/><br/> The dynamic integration module 51a of the sales management server 51 dynamically integrates one or more of multiple electronic commerce service providers 23 within the sales management system 10 for facilitating purchase of multiple sale items
11 or related sale item 21 from within the digital media 15.  In an embodiment, the dynamic integration module 51a further integrates multiple social networking applications 53 to promote the sale items.  The media display module 50a of the digital media
application 50 displays the digital media 15 comprising the interactive digital content 19 on the consumer device 12 via the GUI 14.  The GUI 14 comprises an interactive interface, for example, a webpage of a website hosted by the sales management system
10, an online web interface, a web based downloadable application interface, a mobile based downloadable application interface, etc. The indicator management module 50b of the digital media application 50 preferably inserts an indicator element 18 at a
predefined location within the interactive digital content 19 in the digital media 15 as disclosed in more detail relative to FIG. 1A.  The indicator management module 50b further displays one or more sale item indicators 17 positioned proximal to the
sale items 11 within the interactive digital content 19 in the digital media 15 on the consumer device 12 via the GUI 14 when the indicator element is activated as exemplarily discussed above relative to FIGS. 1A-1B.
<br/><br/> The information retrieval module 51b of the sales management server 51 retrieves sale item information associated with one of the sale items 11, and selects one of the electronic commerce service providers 23 for completing purchase of the sale
item 11, when one of the sale item indicators 17 associated with the sale item 11 is activated within the interactive digital content 19 in the digital media 15 via the GUI 14.  The information retrieval module 51b retrieves the sale item information
associated with the sale item 11, and selects the electronic commerce service provider 23 by performing multiple actions, for example, the information retrieval module 51b first retrieves a sale item identifier of the sale item, a vendor identifier, and
vendor configuration settings.  The information retrieval module 51b then determines one of the electronic commerce service providers 23 for completing the purchase of the sale item based on the retrieved vendor configuration settings, the retrieved sale
item identifier, and the retrieved vendor identifier.  The information retrieval module 51b retrieves related sale items 21 exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 1B, and sale item details associated with the sale item 11 and sale item information associated
with the related sale item 21 based on the retrieved sale item identifier.  The information retrieval module 51b further retrieves inventory information related to the sale item 11 from the determined electronic commerce service provider 23.
<br/><br/> The media display module 50a displays the dynamic interactive display element 24 linked to the activated sale item indicator 17 within the digital media 15 on the consumer device 12 via the GUI 14.  The media display module 50a further renders a
content display interface associated with the selected electronic commerce service provider 23 within the dynamic interactive display element 24 based on a selection of one of the direct purchasing options for initiating purchase of the sale item 11 from
within the dynamic interactive display element 24 and thereby generating sales through the interactive digital content 19 within the digital media 15.  In an embodiment, the information retrieval module 51b further logs and validates a consumer request
for viewing the sale item information prior to rendering the sale item information within the dynamic interactive display element 24.
<br/><br/> With the above-described system 10, the method of the invention may be performed, wherein FIG. 3 generally shows the steps of the inventive method by which an improved purchasing process can be achieved.
<br/><br/> In method step 101, the computer implemented method disclosed herein dynamically integrates one or more of multiple electronic commerce service providers 23 (FIG. 2) within the sales management system 10 for facilitating purchase of multiple
sale items 11 from within the digital media 15 being used by the consumer.  The sales management system 10 is used to integrate various sales items 11 of the electronic commerce service provider 23 which can then be integrated into the interactive
digital content 19 of the digital media 15.
<br/><br/> In method step 102, sales management system 10 displays the digital media 15 comprising the interactive digital content 19 on the consumer device 12 (FIG. 2) via the GUI 14 provided by the sales management system 10.  An example of the display
of digital media 15 is exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 1A above.  The consumer device 12 is an electronic device, for example, a personal computer, a tablet computing device, a mobile computer, a mobile phone, a smart phone, a portable computing device,
a laptop, a personal digital assistant, a touch centric device, a workstation, a client device, a portable electronic device, a network enabled computing device, an interactive network enabled communication device, a web browser, any other suitable
computing equipment, and combinations of multiple pieces of computing equipment, etc. The consumer device 12 may also be a hybrid device that combines the functionality of multiple devices, for example, a portable device that receives email, supports
mobile telephone calls, has music player functionality, and supports web browsing.  When displayed, the interactive digital content 19 promotes sale items 11 that are available for purchase from within the digital media 15, and markets such sale items 11
to consumers through the consumer device 12 being operated or viewed by the consumer.  In addition to promoting the sale item 11 itself, each sale item 11 is mapped to one or more related sale items 21 provided by the electronic commerce service provider
23, wherein the related sales items 21 are also marketed to the consumer.
<br/><br/> The interactive digital content 19 may show various sales items 11 therein which can be viewed by the consumer.  To allow the consumer to identify what sales items 11 are present within the interactive digital content 19 being displayed on the
consumer device 12, the sales management system 10 preferably inserts, in step 103, an indicator element 18 at a predefined location within the interactive digital content 19 in the digital media 15.  As used herein, "indicator element" refers to an
element, for example, an icon or a button that is visible to the consumer, and indicates the presence of an interactive object such as a sale item indicator 17.  Generally, each sale item indicator 17 in turn may be activated to reveal hidden content
when activated.  The indicator element 18 is also shown and described relative to FIGS. 1A and 1B.
<br/><br/> When the indicator element 18 is activated by the consumer, the indicator element 18 invokes a display of one or more sale item indicators 17 in step 104.  An exemplary sale item indicator 17 is seen in FIGS. 1A and 1B.  When a consumer clicks
on the indicator element 18, the sales management system 10 activates the indicator element 18, wherein in method step 104, the sales management system 10 displays one or more sale item indicators 17 which are positioned proximal to the sale items 11
contained within the interactive digital content 19 in the digital media 15 on the consumer device via the GUI 14 when the indicator element 18 is activated.  Each sale item indicator 17 is associated with at least one sale item 11 that is available for
purchase from within the interactive digital content 19 in the digital media 15 on the consumer device 12.  A single sale item indicator 17 may be associated with a group or collection of sales items 11.  When the consumer clicks on one of the sale item
indicators 17, the sales management system 10 receives the consumer selection and activates that particular sale item indicator 17 within the interactive digital content 19 in the digital media 15 via the GUI 14.  In one example, digital advertising
might include one or more sales items 11 which may be viewed in the advertising.  The advertising preferably would include an indicator element 18 at a predefined location, and when the consumer clicks on the indicator element 18, one or more sale item
indicators 17 would then be displayed next to respective sale items 11 and be viewable by the consumer.  If a particular sale item 11 interested the consumer, the consumer might then activate the respective sale item indicator 17 which would display the
hidden content associated therewith.
<br/><br/> In step 105, when a particular sales item indicator 17 is activated, the sales management system 10 retrieves sale item information associated with the sale item 11 or multiple sales items 11 and selects one of the electronic commerce service
providers 23 for completing the purchase of any desired sale item 11.  The sale item information comprises sale item details, inventory information, and related sale items 21.  Like the description above relative to FIG. 1B, the sale item details
comprises a sale item name, a sale item size, a sale item description, a recommended use of the sale item, images, related videos, related reviews, and materials used in construction and/or manufacturing of the sale item 11.  The inventory information
comprises a color option, a sizing option, and a quantity option.  The sales management system 10 retrieves the sale item information associated with the sale item 11 and selects one of the electronic commerce service providers 23 by performing multiple
actions.  The sales management system 10 first retrieves a sale item identifier, for example, a sale item identity of the sale item, a seller or vendor identifier, and vendor configuration settings comprising electronic commerce service provider details
such as an electronic commerce service provider identifier, which can be provided by the vendor.  As used herein, "vendor identifier" refers to a unique name or label used to identify a vendor on the sales management system 10.  The sales management
system 10 then determines one of the electronic commerce service providers 23 for completing the purchase of the sale item 11 based on the retrieved vendor configuration settings, the retrieved sale item identifier, and the retrieved vendor identifier. 
The sales management system 10 further retrieves related sale items 21 and sale item details associated with the sale item 11 and related sale items 21 based on the retrieved sale item identifier, which information can be retrieved from server based
storage or an electronic commerce service provider 23.  The sales management system 10 also retrieves inventory information related to the sale item 11 or related sale item 21 from the determined electronic commerce service provider 23.
<br/><br/> In the next step 106, the sales management system 10 displays a dynamic interactive display element 24 linked to the activated sale item indicator 17 within the digital media 15 on the consumer device via the GUI 14.  FIG. 1B illustrates an
example of the dynamic interactive display element 24.  As used herein, "dynamic interactive display element" refers to an interactive pop-up window, for example, a dynamic lightbox 24 that expands to provide a display interface for showcasing the sale
item information and related information.  The dynamic interactive display element 24 displays the retrieved sale item information and provides purchasing options for facilitating purchase of the sale item 11.  The dynamic lightbox 24 displays key
elements to enhance the consumers' experience and knowledge of the sale item 11 as exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 1B.  The dynamic interactive display element 24 displays an images section, a detailed sale item information section, a sale item reviews
section, a sale item related videos section, a related sale items section, and a purchasing details and options section.  The images section presents high-resolution images with zoom capabilities that provide enlarged views of the sale item 11 providing
in depth look and feel of the featured sale item.  The detailed sale item information section provides a detailed description about the sale item 11, recommended uses of the sale item 11, and the materials used in the construction of the sale item 11. 
The sale item reviews section provides reviews written by other consumers who have purchased the sale item 11 and hence allows the consumer to feel more confident about the sale item 11 they are viewing, thereby increasing the odds of purchase.  The
above elements of sale item details are also made available for any selected related sale items 21 in the format presented for sale items.
<br/><br/> The sale item related videos section presents the sale item 11 in a real life environment.  The video allows vendors to display how the sale items 11 perform.  The related sale items section, also referred herein as the "complete the look
section" allows vendors to expose multiple related sale items 21 determined by the vendors that relate to or enhance the success of the advertised sale item 11.  The purchasing details and options section reveals the color, sizing, and quantity options
for each of the sale items.  The purchasing options comprise an indirect purchase option, for example, an "add to" wish list option and a direct purchase option, for example, a buy now option.  The buy now option allows the consumer to instantly purchase
the advertised sale item or sale items 11 or related sale item or related sale items 21 without leaving the dynamic interactive display element 24.  The "add to" wish list option allows the consumer to add the sale items 11 to a shopping cart 41 for
purchase at a later time.  The shopping cart 41 functions as a cart and as a wish list.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the sales management system 10 logs and validates a consumer request for viewing the sale item information prior to rendering the sale item information within the dynamic interactive display element 24.  For example, whenever a
consumer or the digital media application 50 requests for a sale item detail by activating the sales item indicator 17 then the sales management server 51 validates the request before rendering the sale item related details.  Also, every request is
logged into the sales management system 10 for auditing.
<br/><br/> In step 107, the sales management system 10 renders a content display interface associated with the selected electronic commerce service provider 23 within the dynamic interactive display element 24 based on a selection of one of the purchasing
options for initiating purchase of the sale item 11 or related sale item 21 from within the dynamic interactive display element 24 and thereby generating sales through interactive digital content 19 within the digital media 15.  The content display
interface is a graphical user interface, for example, a web page of a website, an online web interface, a web based downloadable application interface, a mobile based downloadable application interface, etc.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the sales management system 10 integrates multiple social networking applications within the dynamic interactive display element 24, to promote the sale items 11 or related sale items 21 and share sale item information.  This
feature allows social network sharing from within the application.  To share an article or product information, the consumer adds their social application accounts with the consumer device 12, such as a mobile device, wherein the accounts are added in an
accounts section provided under device settings.  Social media connectivity provides consumers the ability or tools to promote guerilla advertising of sale items 11 about which they are passionate about to other members of targeted consumer groups. 
Examples of social networking applications comprise, for example, blogs such as Slogger, LiveJournal.RTM.  of Primordial Soup Ltd., Open Diary, TypePad.RTM.  of Six Apart Ltd., WordPress.RTM.  of WordPress Foundation, Vox.RTM.  and VOXopolis.RTM.  of
Voxopolis Inc., ExpressionEngine.RTM.  of PMachine, Inc., Xanga.RTM.  of Xanga.com, Inc.; micro-blogging and presence applications comprising, for example, Twitter.RTM.  of Twitter, Inc., Plurk, Tumblr..RTM.  of Tumblr, Inc., Jaiku of Google, Inc.,
Fmylife.RTM.; social networking such as Bebo.RTM.  of Bebo, Inc., Facebook.RTM.  of <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Inc., Linkedin.RTM.  of Linkedin Corporation, MySpace.RTM.  of MySpace Inc., Orkut.RTM.  of Google, Inc., Skyrock.RTM., Hi5.RTM.  of Hi5 Networks, Inc.,
Ning.RTM.  of Ning, Inc., Elgg and social network aggregation applications such as NutshellMail, FriendFeed.RTM.  of <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Inc., etc.
<br/><br/> The method of FIG. 3 is further illustrated and explained relative to remaining FIGS. 4-9.  These following figures and the descriptions thereof further discuss the concepts and terminology used with respect to FIGS. 1-3.
<br/><br/> More particularly, FIG. 4 exemplarily illustrates a process flow diagram comprising the steps performed by the sales management system 10 for generating sales through the interactive digital content 19 within the digital media 15.  The sales
management system 10 comprises the digital media application 50 in operative communication with the sales management server 51 via the network 52.  The digital media application 50 is configured as a software application downloadable on the consumer
device 12 such as through the network 52.  The digital media application 50 displays multiple presentations of digital media 15, for example, digital magazine articles on the consumer device 12 via the graphical user interface (GUI) 14 as disclosed in
the detailed description of FIGS. 1A-1D.  The digital media application 50 provides vendors the ability to directly advertise multiple related sale items 21 or sale items 11 to targeted consumer groups via the interactive digital content 19 within the
digital media 15, at a time when the consumer is more likely to purchase.  For example referring to FIG. 4, when a consumer initiates a request 201 for digital media 15 such as a digital article through the digital media application 50, the digital media
application 50 retrieves the requested digital media 15 by deploying an application programming interface (API) 202 that utilizes the JavaScript.RTM.  object notation (JSON) data interchange format of Sun Microsystems, Inc.  The digital media application
50 then displays the retrieved digital media 15 on the GUI 14 of the consumer device 12.  The digital media application 50 embeds the interactive digital content 19, for example, an image within the retrieved digital media 15 along with an indicator
element 18 that indicates the existence of a sale item 11 such as a product displayed in the image that is available for purchase from within the digital media 15.  The digital media application 50 allows the consumer to click on the advertised sale item
11 in the image within the digital article as described above relative to FIGS. 1A-1B.  The indicator element 18 is also disclosed in more detail in the following description and figures.
<br/><br/> When the indicator element 18 (FIGS. 1A and 1B) is activated, the digital media application identifies 203 a tag of the interactive digital content 19, for example, an image tag of the image with the sale item identifier and adds 204 a "&gt;"
icon 17 (FIG. 1A) on the top left side of the sale item 11 in the image or the interactive digital content 19 as seen in FIG. 1A.  When the consumer taps 205 on the "&gt;" icon 17, the digital media application 50 gets or retrieves 206 the sale item 11
and sale item detail from the sales management server 51 by deploying another application programming interface (API).  The digital media application 50 further interacts with an electronic commerce service provider 23 such as Amazon.RTM.  or eBay.RTM. 
to get or retrieve 207 sale item information or, at a minimum, inventory information and electronic service provider's sale item code(s).  The digital media application binds 209 the retrieved details, that is, the retrieved sale item details, the
inventory information, and the related sale items 21 in the dynamic interactive display element 24, for example, a dynamic lightbox for displaying the retrieved details as seen in FIG. 1B.  The digital media application 50 displays the complete sale item
information to the consumer.
<br/><br/> The dynamic interactive display element 24 further provides purchasing options for purchasing the sale items as disclosed in the detailed description of FIGS. 1A-1D.  When the consumer clicks on a purchasing option within the dynamic interactive
display element 24, the digital media application 50 adds 210 the sale item 11 or related sale item 21 to a shopping cart 41 (FIG. 1C) provided by the digital media application 50 for facilitating purchase 211 of the sale item 11 or related sale item 21. The digital media application 50 displays or shows 212 the shopping cart 41 with the price and the quantity option along with a checkout button 48 that directs the consumer to the third party 54, which typically is the appropriate electronic commerce
service provider 23.  The digital media application 50 allows the consumer to increase the quantity of the sale item 11 or related sale item 21, i.e. the selected sale item 42, in the shopping cart by selecting the quantity option.  The digital media
application 50 automatically updates the quantity of the sale item 11 or related sale item 21 in the shopping cart 41.  When the consumer taps 213 on the checkout button 48 to purchase the sale item 11 or related sale item 21, the digital media
application 50 posts 214 the selected sale items to the electronic commerce service provider 23 by deploying a third party API and embeds the view in the dynamic interactive display element 24.  For example, if the electronic commerce service provider 23
is Amazon.RTM., then the dynamic interactive display element 24 displays the Amazon.RTM.  website 49 (FIG. 1D) within the digital media 15 and the consumer can purchase the sale item 11 or related sale item 21 using an Amazon.RTM.  shopping cart.  Once
the consumer purchases the sale item 11 or related sale item 21, the digital media application 50 removes the sale item 11 or related sale item 21 from the shopping cart 41.  The consumer can track his/her order from the Amazon.RTM.  website 49.  In this
manner, a purchase of the sales items 11 or related sale item 21 can be completed with minimal interruption to the consumer.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 exemplarily illustrates a process flow diagram comprising the steps performed by the sales management system 10 for retrieving sale item information and selecting an electronic commerce service provider 23 (FIG. 2).  FIG. 5 exemplarily
illustrates the interactions between the different modules of the sales management system 10.  The sales management system 10 supports the integration of multiple third-party or electronic commerce service provider shopping carts for checkout.  For
example, few vendors such as content providers and/or publishers may use Amazon.RTM.  store as their shopping cart but some of the vendors prefer to use eBay.RTM..  The sales management system 10 provides the option to target the appropriate third party
or electronic commerce service provider shopping cart based on the vendor configuration settings.  When a consumer checks 301 a sale item or product 11 or related sale item 21, the digital media application 50 of the sales management system 10 receives
the consumer request for sale item information on the sale item 11 or related sale item 21 and passes the request to the sales management server 51 for retrieving the sale item information.
<br/><br/> Before rendering the sale item information, the sales management server 51 verifies 302 the electronic commerce service provider cart configuration settings to determine the appropriate shopping cart that is to be used during checkout.  Since
each sale item is potentially mapped 303 to multiple related sale items 21 exemplarily illustrated in FIGS. 1A-1D, provided by the electronic commerce service provider 23, the sales management server 51 identifies the appropriate electronic commerce
service provider identifier to fetch the inventory information.  The entire sale item details are retrieved either from the sales management server 51 or from the electronic commerce service provider 23 at the same time.  The sales management server 51
sends a request to the determined electronic commerce service provider 23 to fetch the inventory details.  The sales management server 51 then merges the inventory details to the sale item details to obtain the sale item information 304 and renders the
final output to the digital media application 50.
<br/><br/> Next, FIG. 6 exemplarily illustrates a flowchart comprising the steps performed by the sales management system 10 for retrieving sale item information and selecting an electronic commerce service provider 23.  When a consumer checks 401 a sale
item 11 and requests sale item information for the sale item 11 which is tagged within the interactive digital content 19 in the digital media 15, the sales management server 51 of the sales management system 10 retrieves or receives 402 a sale item
identifier and a vendor identifier associated with the sale item.  The sales management server 51 then checks or verifies 403 the validity of the vendor identifier.  For example, the sales management server 51 verifies if the vendor identifier exists and
if the vendor identifier is a valid identifier.  If the vendor identifier is not a valid identifier then the sales management server 51 returns 404 an error message.  If the vendor identifier is a valid identifier then the sales management server 51
determines or finds 405 the electronic commerce service provider 23 associated with the vendor identifier.  The sales management server 51 then retrieves 406 the electronic commerce service provider's credentials from the vendor identifier for
determining the appropriate shopping cart that is to be used during checkout.  The electronic commerce service provider credentials or vendor configuration settings comprise, for example, a sale item identifier, an electronic commerce service provider
identifier, and security keys.  The sales management server 51 utilizes the electronic commerce service provider credentials to call 407 the electronic commerce service provider to get sale item information or product inventory details.  The sales
management server 51 converts 408 all the retrieved sale item information into a format that is recognized by the digital media application 50 and returns 409 the retrieved sale item information to the digital media application 50.
<br/><br/> Still further, FIG. 7 exemplarily illustrates a process flow diagram comprising the steps performed by the sales management system 10 for coordinating purchase of the sale item 11 or related sale item 21 from within the digital media 15.  When a
consumer clicks on a sale item 11 displayed in an interactive digital content 19 within the digital media 15, the digital media application 50 requests for sale item information and electronic commerce service provider details from the sales management
server 51.  The sales management server 51 sends the request to the electronic commerce service provider 23.  The electronic commerce service provider 23 receives the request from the sales management server 51 and sends a response to the sales
management server 51 based on the sale item identifier, security keys, security tokens, etc., used for authentication.  The sales management server 51 retrieves 501 the sale item information or, at a minimum, the inventory detail from the electronic
commerce service provider 23 and provides 502 the retrieved information to the digital media application 50 as sale item information.  The digital media application 50 displays 503 the sale item information on the consumer device 12 via the GUI 14.
<br/><br/> The digital media application 50 provides an inbuilt shopping cart 41 that allows a consumer to add one or more sale items 11 or related sale items 21 that the consumer wants to purchase.  The digital media application 50 adds 504 the selected
sale items 11 or related sale items 21 to the shopping cart 41.  The shopping cart 41 can be used to maintain more than one sale item 11 or related sale item 21.  The shopping cart 41 provides a checkout or purchase button 48.  When the consumer clicks
505 on the purchase button 48, the digital media application 50 deploys 506 a cart application programming interface (API) and sends a cart API request to the electronic commerce service provider 23.  The cart API adds the sale items 11 or related sale
items 21 in the shopping cart 41 and returns the details.  The digital media application 50 transfers the sale items 11 or related sale items 21 to the electronic commerce service provider cart and embeds the electronic commerce service provider cart in
the dynamic interactive display element 24 within the digital media 15 for example as seen in FIG. 1D.  The dynamic interactive display element 24 loads or shows 507 the shopping cart along with the selected sale items 11 or related sale items 21.  The
consumer can then complete the checkout 508 process from within the digital media 15.  When the consumer clicks on the checkout button, the digital media application 50 allows the consumer to purchase the sale items 11 or related sale items 21 without
moving out or navigating away from the digital media 15.
<br/><br/> In more detail, FIG. 8 exemplarily illustrates a flowchart comprising the steps performed by the sales management system 10 for coordinating purchase of the sale item 11 or related sale item 21 from within the digital media 15.  When a consumer
initiates a request 601 for sale item detail of a sale item 11 or related sale item 21, the digital media application 50 retrieves 602 the sale item details of the sale item 11, and picture details from the sales management server 51 by using a sale item
identifier or product identifier.  The sales management server 51 sends a request to the electronic commerce service provider 23 to fetch 603 sale item information or, at a minimum, inventory details depending on the vendor identifier or publisher
identifier, the sale item identifier, and electronic commerce service provider identifier.  The sale item details and the inventory information are merged and a final output is returned to the digital media application 50.  When the consumer adds 604 the
sale item to the shopping cart and selects 605 the purchase option, the digital media application 50 transfers the selected sale items or the selected related sales items to the electronic commerce service provider cart and displays 606 the website of
the electronic commerce service provider within the dynamic interactive display element in the digital media 15.  The digital media application 50 then facilitates checkout 607 of the sale items 11 or related sale item 21 from the electronic commerce
service provider cart.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 exemplarily illustrates the architecture of a computer system 800 employed by the sales management system 10 exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 2, for generating sales through the interactive digital content 19 within the digital media 15. 
The digital media application 50 and the sales management server 51 of the sales management system 10 exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 2, each employ the architecture of the computer system 800 exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 9.  The computer system 800
is programmable using a high level computer programming language.  The computer system 800 may be implemented using programmed and purposeful hardware.  The digital media application 50 preferably is configured as a software application downloadable on

define a computer platform for which application programs in high level programming languages are written.
<br/><br/> The processor 801 of the computer system 800 employed by the digital media application 50 retrieves instructions defined by the media display module 50a, the indicator management module 50b, etc., of the digital media application 50 for
performing respective functions disclosed in the detailed description of FIG. 7.  The processor 801 of the computer system 800 employed by the sales management server 51 retrieves instructions defined by the dynamic integration module 51a, the
information retrieval module 51b, etc., for performing respective functions disclosed in the detailed description of FIG. 7.  The processor 801 retrieves instructions for executing the modules, for example, 50a, 50b, etc., of the digital media
application 50 and the modules, for example, 51a, 51b, etc., of the sales management server 51 from the respective memory units 802.  A program counter determines the location of the instructions in the memory unit 802.  The program counter stores a
number that identifies the current position in the program of each of the modules, for example, 50a, 50b, etc., of the digital media application 50, and the modules, for example, 51a, 51b, etc., of the sales management server 51.  The instructions
fetched by the processor 801 from the memory unit 802 after being processed are decoded.  The instructions are stored in an instruction register in the processor 801.  After processing and decoding, the processor 801 executes the instructions, thereby
performing one or more processes defined by those instructions.
<br/><br/> At the time of execution, the instructions stored in the instruction register are examined to determine the operations to be performed.  The processor 801 then performs the specified operations.  The operations comprise arithmetic operations and
logic operations.  The operating system performs multiple routines for performing a number of tasks required to assign the input devices 807, the output devices 810, and memory for execution of the modules, for example, 50a, 50b, etc., of the digital
media application 50 and the modules, for example, 51a, 51b, etc., of the sales management server 51.  The tasks performed by the operating system comprise, for example, assigning memory to the modules, for example, 50a, 50b, etc., of the digital media
application 50 and the modules, for example, 51a, 51b, etc., of the sales management server 51, and to data used by the digital media application 50 and the sales management server 51, moving data between the memory unit 802 and disk units, and handling
input/output operations.  The operating system performs the tasks on request by the operations and after performing the tasks, the operating system transfers the execution control back to the processor 801.  The processor 801 continues the execution to
obtain one or more outputs.  The outputs of the execution of the modules, for example, 50a, 50b, etc., of the digital media application 50 and the modules, for example, 51a, 51b, etc., of the sales management server 51 are displayed to the consumer on
the display unit 806.
<br/><br/> For purposes of illustration, the detailed description refers to the digital media application 50 being run locally on the consumer device 12 operating the computer system 800; however the scope of the computer implemented method and the sales
management system 10 disclosed herein is not limited to the digital media application 50 being run locally on the consumer device 12 via the operating system and the processor 801, but may be extended to run remotely over the network 52 by employing a
web browser and a remote server, a mobile phone, or other electronic devices.  One or more portions of the computer system 800 may be distributed across one or more computer systems (not shown) coupled to the network 52.
<br/><br/> The above-described computer system 800 therefore is provided so as to operate a computer program product.  The following provides further disclosure as to the computer program product which comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage
medium that stores computer program codes comprising instructions executable by at least one processor 801 for generating sales through the interactive digital content 19 within the digital media 15.
<br/><br/> The computer program product comprises a first computer program code for dynamically integrating one or more of multiple electronic commerce service providers 23 within the sales management system 10 for facilitating purchase of multiple sale
items 11 from within digital media 15; a second computer program code for displaying the digital media 15 comprising interactive digital content 19 on a consumer device 12 via a GUI 14; a third computer program code for inserting an indicator element 18
at a predefined location within the interactive digital content 19 in the digital media 15 if desired; a fourth computer program code for displaying one or more sale item indicators 17 positioned proximal to the sale items 11 within the interactive
digital content 19 in the digital media 15 on the consumer device 12 via the GUI 14 when the indicator element 18 is activated or even continuously if the indicator element 18 is eliminated; a fifth computer program code for retrieving sale item
information or, at a minimum, inventory detail associated with one of the sale items 11 or related sale items 21, and selecting one of the electronic commerce service providers 23 for completing the purchase of the sale item 11; a sixth computer program
code for displaying a dynamic interactive display element 24 linked to the activated sale item indicator 17 within the digital media 15 on the consumer device 12 via the GUI 14; and a seventh computer program code for rendering a content display
interface associated with the selected electronic commerce service provider 23 within the dynamic interactive display element 24 based on a selection of one of the direct purchasing options for initiating purchase of the sale item 11 or related sale
items 21 from within the dynamic interactive display element 24 and thereby generating sales through the interactive digital content 19 within the digital media 15.
<br/><br/> The fifth computer code further comprises an eighth computer program code for retrieving a sale item identifier of the sale item 11 or related sale items 21, a vendor identifier, and vendor configuration settings; a ninth computer program code
for determining one of the electronic commerce service providers 23 for completing purchase of the sale item 11 based on the retrieved vendor configuration settings, the retrieved sale item identifier, and the retrieved vendor identifier; a tenth
computer program code for retrieving related sale items 21 exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 1B, and sale item information associated with the related sale item 21 based on the retrieved sale item identifier; and an eleventh computer program code for
logging and validating a consumer request for viewing the sale item information prior to rendering the sale item information within the dynamic interactive display element 24.  The computer program product disclosed herein further comprises one or more
additional computer program codes for performing additional steps that may be required and contemplated for generating sales through the interactive digital content 19 within the digital media 15.  In an embodiment, a single piece of computer program
code comprising computer executable instructions performs one or more steps of the computer implemented method disclosed herein for generating sales through interactive digital content 19 within digital media 15.
<br/><br/> The computer program codes comprising computer executable instructions are embodied on the non-transitory computer readable storage medium.  The processor 801 of the computer system 800 retrieves these computer executable instructions and
executes them.  When the computer executable instructions are executed by the processor 801, the computer executable instructions cause the processor 801 to perform the steps of the computer implemented method for generating sales through interactive
digital content 19 within digital media 15.  The above-described methods and system 10 provide an improved system for facilitating purchases of sales items 11 including related sales items 21.
<br/><br/> In operation, the particular presentation of the digital media 15 can vary and depend upon many factors.  In this regard, FIGS. 1A-1D illustrate sample screenshots of the graphical user interface (GUI) 14 provided by the digital media
application 50 of the sales management system 10, for generating sales through the interactive digital content 19 within the digital media 15.  The screenshot of the GUI 14 of FIG. 1A shows the digital media application 50 displaying the digital media
15, for example, as a digital magazine which includes a digital article on skiing.  The article might be a general discussion of skiing or some other topic and as such, is not necessarily presented to the consumer as an obvious advertisement.  However,
it will be understood that the photo of the skier could also be part of an advertisement or catalog without departing from the present invention.  In any case, the digital media 15 comprises the interactive digital content 19, which includes one or more
sale items 11 that can be viewed by a potential consumer.  The digital media application 50 of the sales management system 10 disclosed herein enhances sales success of digital magazine articles advertisements by facilitating purchase of the sale item 11
from within the digital magazine.  The sales management system 10 may display various sale items 11 through the digital media application 50, as well as the related sale items 21, which vendors believe are appropriate.
<br/><br/> In accord with the above discussion of FIGS. 1A and 1B, the digital media application 50 embeds the indicator element 18 in the GUI 14, which on activation by the consumer invokes the display of a sale item indicator 17 positioned proximal to
the sales item 11.  The consumer will recognize that the indicator element 18 essentially indicates that sales items 11 are present with the digital media 15.  When a consumer becomes interested and activates the "P" icon 18, the digital media
application 50 displays the sale item indicator 17 next to the helmet 11, which indicates that the helmet 11 is purchasable from within the digital media application 50.  In an alternate form of the invention, the indicator element 18 might be omitted
while the sales item indicators 17 are displayed continuously or possibly by passing over a sales item 11 with a cursor or the like.  As described above relative to FIG. 1B, when the consumer activates the sale item indicator 17, the digital media
application 50 retrieves related sale items 21 and sale item details associated with the sales item 11 using a sale item identifier, the vendor identifier, and the vendor configuration settings.  The digital media application 50 determines an electronic
commerce service provider 23 for completing the purchase based on the retrieved information.  The digital media application 50 further retrieves sale item information or, at a minimum, inventory information.
<br/><br/> More particularly as to FIG. 1B, when the sales item indicator 17 is activated, the digital media application 50 displays the dynamic interactive digital element 24 (FIG. 1B) that displays the retrieved sale item information.  All the related
sale items 21 are displayed at the bottom of the dynamic lightbox 24 as thumbnails.  When the consumer clicks on one of the related sale items 21 displayed in the related sale item boxes 36 of the related sale items section 40, the digital media
application 50 provides detailed information about the selected related sale item 21.  If the consumer clicks on the add to cart button 34, then the digital media application 50 adds the sales item 11 or related sale item 21 to the shopping cart 41 as
seen in FIG. 1C.  The digital media application 50 provides the toolbar 43 that provides shortcut links to frequently used controls.  When the consumer clicks on the shopping cart icon or shopping bag icon on the toolbar 43, the digital media application
50 displays the shopping cart 41 within the dynamic interactive digital element or dynamic lightbox 24 showing all the selected sale items 11 or related sale items 21 added to the shopping cart 41 (FIG. 1C).  If the consumer decides to proceed and
purchase the helmet 11 by clicking on the purchase button 35, the digital media application 50 routes to electronic commerce service provider 23 such as Amazon.RTM.  as exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 1D.
<br/><br/> Preferably as seen in FIG. 1C, the shopping cart 41 displays the sale items 11 and related sale items 21, and the digital media application 50 allows the consumer to edit size and quantity of each sale item 11 or related sale item 21 in the
shopping cart 41 and select one or more items for immediate purchase.  The digital media application 50 automatically updates the shopping cart 41 based on the consumer selections of the sale items 11, the quantity option, and the size option.  The
shopping cart 41 also provides the checkout button 48 that allows the consumer to checkout the selected sale items 11, or related sale items 21, and redirects the consumer to the electronic commerce service provider 23 (FIG. 1D).  The provider web site
49 is loaded in the dynamic lightbox 24 within the digital media and the consumer can continue the purchase through the electronic commerce service provider web site.
