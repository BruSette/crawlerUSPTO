<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method comprising: by a computing device, accessing a sequence of video frames;  by the computing device, analyzing one or more of the video frames in the sequence to
identify one or more social-network objects, wherein each of the social-network objects is represented by a node in a social graph that comprises a plurality of nodes and edges connecting the nodes;  by the computing device, determining a score for each
of the identified social-network objects;  by the computing device, computing a score for each of the analyzed video frames based at least in part on a total aggregate value of the social-network objects identified in the video frame;  by the computing
device, selecting one or more of the analyzed video frames based on the scores of the video frames;  and by the computing device, presenting the selected one or more of the video frames to a first user, wherein each of the selected one or more of the
video frames is presented as an image.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: in response to the first user's indication, storing at least one of the selected one or more of the video frames in a persistent storage.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 2, wherein the presenting the selected one or more of the video frames to the first user, further comprises: presenting to the first user a graphical user interface comprising a scrollable media wheel of one or more
thumbnails corresponding to the selected one or more of the video frames.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 1, wherein the computed score assigned to each respective video frame is further based on an affinity associated with each of the one or more identified social-network objects in the video frame.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 1, further comprising capturing a video item that includes the sequence.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: adjusting the computed score assigned to each of one or more of the video frames based on a measurement of popularity of each of the one or more identified social-network objects in the video frame.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: adjusting the computed score assigned to each of one or more of the video frames based on a measurement of picture quality of the video frame.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: adjusting the computed score assigned to each of one or more of the video frames based on an indication of importance associated with the video frame.
<br/><br/> 9.  A system comprising: a memory;  one or more processors;  and a non-transitory storage medium storing computer-readable instructions operative, when executed, to cause the one or more processors to: access a sequence of video frames;  analyze
one or more of the video frames in the sequence to identify one or more social-network objects, wherein each of the social-network objects is represented by a node in a social graph that comprises a plurality of nodes and edges connecting the nodes; 
determine a score for each of the identified social-network objects;  compute a score for each of the analyzed video frames based at least in part on a total aggregate value of the social-network objects identified in the video frame;  select one or more
of the analyzed video frames based on the scores of the video frames;  and present the selected one or more of the video frames to a first user, wherein each of the selected one or more of the video frames is presented as an image.
<br/><br/> 10.  The system of claim 9, further comprising instructions operable to cause the one or more processors to: in response to the first user's indication, store at least one of the selected one or more of the video frames in a persistent storage.

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> The present disclosure generally relates to methods of capturing images and identifying persons and objects in a real-time video based on social network information.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system.  The social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a user profile, in
connection with the user.  The user profile may include a user's demographic information, communication channel information, and personal interests.  The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user's relationship with other
users in the social networking system (e.g., social graph), as well as provide services (e.g., wall-posts, photo-sharing, or instant messaging) to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system.  A geo-social networking
system is a social networking system in which geographic services and capabilities are used to enable additional social interactions.  User-submitted location data or geo-location techniques (e.g., mobile phone position tracking) can allow a geo-social
network system to connect and coordinate users with local people or events that match their interests.  For example, users can check-in to a place using a mobile client application by providing a name of a place (or selecting a place from a
pre-established list of places).  The geo-social networking system, among other things, can record information about the user's presence at the place and possibly provide this information to other users of the geo-social networking system.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The invention is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.  In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding
of the present disclosure.  It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details.  In other instances, well known process steps and/or structures have not been
described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure.  In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the
disclosure to the described embodiments.  To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.
<br/><br/> A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it, and with each other through, the system.  Typically, to become a registered user of a social networking system, an entity, either human or
non-human, registers for an account with the social networking system.  Thereafter, the registered user may log into the social networking system via an account by providing, for example, a login ID or username and password.  As used herein, a "user" may
be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.
<br/><br/> When a user registers for an account with a social networking system, the social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a "user profile", in connection with the user.  The user profile may include information
provided by the user and information gathered by various systems, including the social networking system, relating to activities or actions of the user.  For example, the user may provide his name, profile picture, contact information, birth date,
gender, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, and other demographical information to be included in his user profile.  The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user
considers to be his friends.  A list of the user's friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user's profile.  Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction.  For example, if Bob and Joe
are both users and connect with each another, Bob and Joe are each connections of the other.  If, on the other hand, Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam's posted content items, but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob, a one-way connection may be
formed where Sam is Bob's connection, but Bob is not Sam's connection.  Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections (e.g., friends of friends).  Connections may be added
explicitly by a user, for example, the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend, or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users (e.g., users who are alumni of the same educational
institution).  The user may identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user's profile.
<br/><br/> The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user (such as contact information and interests) at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time.  The user may also update his or her profile information at
any time.  For example, when the user moves, or changes a phone number, he may update his contact information.  Additionally, the user's interests may change as time passes, and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time.  A
user's activities on the social networking system, such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system, may also provide information that may be included in the user's profile.  Again, such information may be updated from time to time to
reflect the user's most-recent activities.  Still further, other users or so-called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user's profile.  For example, a contact may add the user as a friend (or
remove the user as a friend).  A contact may also write messages to the user's profile pages typically known as wall-posts.  A user may also input status messages that get posted to the user's profile page.
<br/><br/> A social network system may maintain social graph information, which can generally model the relationships among groups of individuals, and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds.  A social network
may be represented using a graph structure.  Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network.  Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users.  In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is
defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other.  A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.
<br/><br/> A social networking system may support a variety of applications, such as photo sharing, on-line calendars and events.  For example, the social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities.  For example, the social networking
system may allow users to post photographs and other multimedia files to a user's profile, such as in a wall post or in a photo album, both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system.  Social networking system may also
allow users to configure events.  For example, a first user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event, location of the event and other users invited to the event.  The invited users may receive invitations to the event
and respond (such as by accepting the invitation or declining it).  Furthermore, social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar.  Similarly to events, the calendar entries may include times, dates, locations and identities of
other users.
<br/><br/> The social networking system may also support a privacy model.  A user may or may not wish to share his information with other users or third-party applications, or a user may wish to share his information only with specific users or third-party
applications.  A user may control whether his information is shared with other users or third-party applications through privacy settings associated with his user profile.  For example, a user may select a privacy setting for each user datum associated
with the user and/or select settings that apply globally or to categories or types of user profile information.  A privacy setting defines, or identifies, the set of entities (e.g., other users, connections of the user, friends of friends, or third party
application) that may have access to the user datum.  The privacy setting may be specified on various levels of granularity, such as by specifying particular entities in the social network (e.g., other users), predefined groups of the user's connections,
a particular type of connections, all of the user's connections, all first-degree connections of the user's connections, the entire social network, or even the entire Internet (e.g., to make the posted content item index-able and searchable on the
Internet).  A user may choose a default privacy setting for all user data that is to be posted.  Additionally, a user may specifically exclude certain entities from viewing a user datum or a particular type of user data.
<br/><br/> The social networking system may maintain a database of information relating to geographic locations or places.  Places may correspond to various physical locations, such as restaurants, bars, train stations, airports and the like.  In one
implementation, each place can be maintained as a hub node in a social graph or other data structure maintained by the social networking system, as described in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 12/763,171, which is incorporated by reference herein for
all purposes.  Social networking system may allow users to access information regarding each place using a client application (e.g., a browser) hosted by a wired or wireless station, such as a laptop, desktop or mobile device.  For example, social
networking system may serve web pages (or other structured documents) to users that request information about a place.  In addition to user profile and place information, the social networking system may track or maintain other information about the
user.  For example, the social networking system may support geo-social networking system functionality including one or more location-based services that record the user's location.  For example, users may access the geo-social networking system using a
special-purpose client application hosted by a mobile device of the user (or a web- or network-based application using a browser client).  The client application may automatically access Global Positioning System (GPS) or other geo-location functions
supported by the mobile device and report the user's current location to the geo-social networking system.  In addition, the client application may support geo-social networking functionality that allows users to check-in at various locations and
communicate this location to other users.  A check-in to a given place may occur when a user is physically located at a place and, using a mobile device, access the geo-social networking system to register the user's presence at the place.  A user may
select a place from a list of existing places near to the user's current location or create a new place.  The social networking system may automatically checks in a user to a place based on the user's current location and past location data, as described
in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 13/042,357 filed on Mar.  7, 2011, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.  An entry including a comment and a time stamp corresponding to the time the user checked in may be displayed to other
users.  For example, a record of the user's check-in activity may be stored in a database.  Social networking system may select one or more records associated with check-in activities of users at a given place and include such check-in activity in web
pages (or other structured documents) that correspond to a given place.  The check-in activity may also be displayed on a user profile page and in news feeds provided to users of the social networking system.
<br/><br/> Still further, a special purpose client application hosted on a mobile device of a user may be configured to continuously capture location data of the mobile device and send the location data to social networking system.  In this manner, the
social networking system may track the user's location and provide various recommendations to the user related to places that are proximal to the user's path or that are frequented by the user.  In one implementation, a user may opt in to this
recommendation service, which causes the client application to periodically post location data of the user to the social networking system.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example social networking system.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store user profile data and social graph information in user profile database 101.  In particular embodiments, the social
networking system may store user event data in event database 102.  For example, a user may register a new event by accessing a client application to define an event name, a time and a location, and cause the newly created event to be stored in event
database 102.  For example, a user may register with an existing event by accessing a client application to confirming attending the event, and cause the confirmation to be stored in event database 102.  In particular embodiments, the social networking
system may store user privacy policy data in privacy policy database 103.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store geographic and location data in location database 104.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system
may store media data (e.g., photos, or video clips) in media database 105.  In particular embodiments, databases 101, 102, 103, 104, and 105 may be operably connected to the social networking system's front end 120.  In particular embodiments, the front
end 120 may interact with client device 122 through network cloud 121.  For example, the front end 120 may be implemented in software programs hosted by one or more server systems.  For example, each database such as user profile database 101 may be
stored in one or more storage devices.  Client device 122 is generally a computer or computing device including functionality for communicating (e.g., remotely) over a computer network.  Client device 122 may be a desktop computer, laptop computer,
personal digital assistant (PDA), in- or out-of-car navigation system, smart phone or other cellular or mobile phone, or mobile gaming device, among other suitable computing devices.  Client device 122 may execute one or more client applications, such as
a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera, etc.) or special-purpose client application (e.g., <b><i>Facebook</i></b> for iPhone, etc.), to access and view content over a computer network.  Front
end 120 may include web or HTTP server functionality, as well as other functionality, to allow users to access the social networking system.  Network cloud 121 generally represents a network or collection of networks (such as the Internet, a corporate
intranet, a virtual private network, a local area network, a wireless local area network, a wide area network, a metropolitan area network, or a combination of two or more such networks) over which client devices 122 may access the social network system.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store an information base of places, where each place includes a name, a geographic location and meta information (such as the user that initially created the place, reviews, comments,
check-in activity data, one or more web pages associated with the place and corresponding links to the one or more web pages, and the like).  Places may be created by administrators of the system and/or created by users of the system.  For example, a
user may register a new place by accessing a client application to define a place name and provide a geographic location and cause the newly created place to be registered in location database 104.  As described in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No.
12/763,171, information about a created place may be stored in a hub node in a social graph, which an administrator can claim for purposes of augmenting the information about the place and for creating ads or other offers to be delivered to users.  In
particular embodiments, system front end 120 may construct and serve a web page of a place, as requested by a user.  In some embodiments, a web page of a place may include selectable components for a user to "like" the place or check in to the place.  In
particular embodiments, location database 104 may store geo-location data identifying a real-world geographic location of a user associated with a check-in. For example, a geographic location of an Internet connected computer can be identified by the
computer's IP address.  For example, a geographic location of a cell phone equipped with cellular, Wi-Fi and/or GPS capabilities can be identified by cell tower triangulation, Wi-Fi positioning, and/or GPS positioning.  In particular embodiments,
location database 104 may store a geographic location and additional information of a plurality of places.  For example, a place can be a local business, a point of interest (e.g., Union Square in San Francisco, Calif.), a college, a city, or a national
park.  For example, a geographic location of a place (e.g., a local coffee shop) can be an address, a set of geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), or a reference to another place (e.g., "the coffee shop next to the train station").  For
example, additional information of a place can be business hours, photos, or user reviews of the place.  In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store a user's location data.  For example, a user can create a place (e.g., a new restaurant or
coffee shop) and the social networking system can store the created place in location database 104.  For example, location database 104 may store a user's check-in activities.  For example, location database 104 may store a user's geographic location
provided by the user's GPS-equipped mobile device.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a user of the social networking system may upload one or more media files to media database 105.  For example, a user can upload a photo or a set of photos (often called a photo album), or a video clip (or an audio
clip) to media database 105 from a client device 122 (e.g., a computer, or a camera phone).  The user may further select one or more privacy settings for each of the uploaded media files (e.g., accessible to only first-degree connections, accessible to
only first- and second-degree connections, accessible to all users of the social networking system).  In particular embodiments, the one or more media files may contain metadata (often called "tags") associated with each media file.  For example, a photo
shot by a digital camera may contain metadata relating to file size, resolution, time stamp, name of the camera maker, and/or location (e.g., GPS) coordinates.  A user can add additional metadata values to a photo, or tag a photo, during or in connection
with an upload process.  Some examples of tags of a media file are author, title, comments, event names, time, location, names of people appearing in the media file, or user comment.  In one implementation, the client device 122 may implement the
Exchangeable image file format (Exif), or a modified version thereof.  In particular embodiments, a user may tag a media file by using a client application (e.g., a photo or video editor), or entering one or more tags in a graphical user interface of a
media uploading tool that uploads a user's one or more media files from a client device 122 to the social networking system.  A user may also tag a media file after an upload at a later time in the social networking system's web site.  U.S.  Pat.  No.
7,945,653, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes, describes methods of enabling a first user of a social networking system to select a region of a photo and associate the selected region to a second user, and in response
to a confirmation from the second user, storing the association in a database.  As described in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 12/763,171, the photo and related information (e.g., one or more privacy settings) may be stored in a particular node of a
social graph, while the association between the photo and the second user may be stored in an edge connecting the particular node and a user node for the second user.  For example, in response to a user's request, the social networking system may, based
on the one or more privacy settings, display the photo with a tag corresponding to the second user, while the tag comprises a link to a webpage (e.g., a user profile page) associated with the second user.  In particular embodiments, the social networking
system may also extract metadata from a media file and store the metadata in media database 105.
<br/><br/> A user can use a digital camera or a camera function provided by a mobile device (e.g., a mobile phone, a tablet computer) to capture photos.  FIG. 2 illustrates an example graphical user interface of a camera function of a mobile device.  In
the example of FIG. 2, a graphical user interface 201 of a camera function of a mobile device 200 may comprise a viewfinder of the camera function.  For example, the user can aim at one or more desired objects, as displayed in the viewfinder, and click
on hardware button 205 (or a software button displayed in graphical user interface 201), causing the camera function to capture a photo and store the photo in a local storage (e.g., an SD card or FLASH memory) of mobile device 200.  Although the camera
function operates in a photo-capturing mode, the camera function may continuously capture video when the camera function is activated.  For example, a viewfinder of a camera function of a mobile device can be a real-time video feed of the camera
function.  Particular embodiments herein describe methods of effectively utilizing real-time video capturing of a camera function of a mobile device.  For example, a user may activate the camera function of the mobile device, while the camera function
starting capturing a real-time video and displaying the real-time video in a viewfinder of the camera function.  Instead of the user capturing a photo by pressing a hardware (or software) button, particular embodiments described herein can automatically
capture one or more images by selecting one or more images relevant to the user from the real-time video being captured by the camera function, and automatically store the selected one or more images in a local storage of the mobile device.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an example method of automatically capturing image frames from a captured video sequence based on social network information and identity recognition.  The example method of FIG. 3 can be implemented by an image capturing
process hosted by one or more processors of a mobile device (e.g., a camera, a mobile phone, a tablet computer, or other suitable portable devices).  In particular embodiments, the image capturing process may access a sequence of video frames stored in a
buffer (301).  In particular embodiments, the sequence of video frames may be associated with a first user.  For example, a first user may activate a camera function of a mobile device, causing the image capturing process (or a child process or a thread
of the image capturing process) to store a real-time video captured by the camera function in a buffer.  As illustrated in FIG. 2, the camera function of a mobile device 200 may display the real-time video in a graphical user interface 201 (e.g., a
viewfinder) of the camera function in a touch screen of the mobile device.  The buffer may be a software buffer of the image capturing process, wherein the buffer may occupy a certain region of a physical memory storage (e.g., DRAM).  In particular
embodiments, the real-time video stored in the buffer may comprise a sequence of video frames.  For example, the buffer may comprise a circular buffer or a similar fixed-size data structure that deletes the oldest frames to store the newest frames.  The
length of the real-time video stored in a circular buffer may depend on a frame rate of the real time video, and/or a resolution of the real-time video.  For example, a real-time video stored in a circular buffer may include a sequence of video frames
with a resolution of 1920.times.1080 pixels, between a current time and 10 seconds before the current time.  For example, the circular buffer can store a sequence of a real-time video with a same frame rate and a resolution of 480.times.360 pixels
between a current time and 2 minutes before the current time.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the image capturing process may analyze frames of the sequence of video frames to identify one or more social network objects (302).  The one or more social network objects may comprise one or more user nodes in a
social graph and corresponding respective users, one or more concept nodes in a social graph and corresponding respective concepts, or any combination of those, as described in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 12/763,171.  For example, a social network
object can be the first user, a social contact of the first user, or any user of the social networking system.  For example, a social network object can be a place, a business, a brand, a product, an organization, a public figure, etc.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the image capturing process may analyze frames of the sequence of video frames stored in the buffer to identify one or more users of the social networking system.  In particular embodiments, the image capturing process
may isolate one or more faces in one or more frames of the sequence of frames, and identify one or more users corresponding to the one or more isolated face.  U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 12/890,283, which describes methods of identifying one or
more users corresponding to one or more faces in an image file (e.g., a photo, a video clip) based on spatio-temporal proximity, is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.  In particular embodiments, the image capturing process may determine a
current location of the first user, and determine a list of users who are at or near the current location.  For example, the image capturing process can access a GPS sensor of the mobile device (e.g., via a device driver of the GPS sensor) for GPS
coordinates corresponding to a current location of the first user.  For example, the image capturing process can access event database 102 and/or location database 104 (e.g., via an application programming interface or API hosted by System Front End 120)
for the first user's current location (e.g., a recent location check-in, a recently recorded GPS location, location data of an event that the first user is currently attending).  For example, the image capturing process can access event database 102
and/or location database 104 for users who are at or near the current location (e.g., a user who has GPS coordinates within 100 feet from the first user's current location, a user who is attending a same event as the first user, a user who has just
checked in to a same location as the first user).  For example, the image capturing process can access media database 105 to identify one or more users who were tagged with the first user in one or more recently uploaded photos or video clips.  Other
methods in identifying one or more other users who are at a same location as the first user may include data reports from mobile devices of other users that have interacted with the first user's mobile phone via Bluetooth or Near-Field Communications
(NFC) protocols.  In one embodiment, the image capturing process may further limit the list of users to users who are at or near the current location and are within a pre-determined threshold degrees of separation from the first user (e.g., users who are
within two degrees of separation from the first user).  For example, the image capturing process can access user profile database 101 to determine social relationship between the first user and each of the list of users.  The image capturing process may
identify one or more users corresponding to the isolated faces by matching (e.g., by using a facial recognition algorithm) facial images of the list of users to the one or more isolated faces.  For example, the image capturing process can access user
profile database 101 and/or a local address book (or photo albums) in the mobile device for user profile pictures of one or more users of the list of users, and match the user profile pictures to the one or more isolated faces.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the image capturing process may analyze frames of the sequence of video frames to identify one or more users of the social networking system based on audio recorded in the sequence of video frames.  In particular
embodiments, the image capturing process may isolate one or more audio segments in the sequence of video frames.  In particular embodiments, the image capturing process may determine (e.g., by accessing location database 104) a list of users who are at
or near a current location of the first user, and identify one or more users corresponding to the one or more voice segments by matching (e.g., by using a audio recognition algorithm) audio data (e.g., a voicemail left by a user, a video clip tagged to a
user) of the list of users to the one or more audio segments.  For example, an audio recognition algorithm may transform a waveform of an audio file in time domain to frequency domain by a suitable mathematical transformation (e.g., Fast Fourier
Transform, Discrete Cosine Transform, wavelet transform), and extract a "fingerprint" of the audio file in frequency domain.  The audio recognition algorithm may determine a match between two audio files by comparing fingerprints of the two audio files. 
For example, the audio recognition algorithm can determine a match between an unknown audio file (e.g., an audio segment of the sequence of video frames) and an audio file associated with a known identity (e.g., a voicemail left by a user) by comparing a
fingerprint of the unknown audio file and a fingerprint of the audio file associated with a known identity.
<br/><br/> In other embodiments, the image capturing process may analyze frames of the sequence of video frames to identify one or more social networking objects other than users of the social networking system.  For example, a social networking object can
be a place (e.g., Eiffel Tower, Golden Gate Bridge, Yosemite National Park, Hollywood), a business or an organization (e.g., a coffee shop, San Francisco Giants), or a brand or product (e.g., Coca-Cola, Louis Vuitton).  The image capturing process may
determine (e.g., by accessing location database 104) a list of social network objects that are at or near a current location of the first user, and identify one or more social networking objects in one or more frames of the sequence of video frames by
matching (e.g., by using an object recognition algorithm) images of the list of social networking objects (e.g., photos associated with each of the list of social network objects) to content in the one or more frames.  For example, an object recognition
algorithm may use optical character recognition techniques to identify one or more characters (e.g., "HOLLYWOOD", "San Francisco Giants") in one or more frames and match against image data (or identity data such as names, logos) of the list of social
network objects nearby.  For example, an object recognition algorithm may use computer vision techniques to extract a set of features (e.g., edges, corners, ridges, blobs, curvatures, etc.) from an image file.  The object recognition algorithm may
determine a match between two image files by comparing respective sets of features of the two image files.  For example, an object recognition algorithm can determine a match between an unknown image file (e.g., one of the frames) and an image file of a
known identity (e.g., an image of Eiffel Tower) by comparing a first set of features of the unknown image file and a second set of features of the image file of a known identity.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the image capturing process may determine a value of the frames of the sequence of frames based on the one or more identified social objects (303).  In particular embodiments, the image capturing process may score the
frames of the sequence of frames based on a number of social network objects identified in each frame of the sequence of frames.  For example, for each frame of the sequence of frames, the image capturing process may assign a score being equal to the
number of social network objects identified in the frame (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, .  . . ). In particular embodiments, the image capturing process may score the frames of the sequence of frames based on affinity between each of the identified one or more
social network objects to the first user.  For example, the image capturing process can assign each identified social network object an affiliation coefficient (e.g., 1.0 if an identified user is the first user's sibling, 0.9 if an identified user
frequently communicate with the first user, 0.3 if an identified user is a second-degree social friend of the first user, or 0.8 for an identified place if the first user frequently checks in to the place, or likes the place page).  A system for
measuring user affinity is described more generally in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 11/503,093, filed on Aug.  11, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.  For example, for each frame of the sequence of frames, the image
capturing process may adjust a score (e.g., the score based on a number of social network objects identified in the frame as described earlier) by multiplying the score by the affiliation coefficient of a social network object identified in the frame. 
In one embodiment, the image capturing process may score the frames of the sequence of frames based on a measurement of popularity of each of the identified one or more social network objects.  For example, the image capturing process may assign a
popularity coefficient for an identified place based on a number of check-ins (or a number of users liking the corresponding place page)--e.g., 1.0 for over 500 check-ins ("extremely popular"), 0.7 for over 100 check-ins ("popular"), and 0.5 for 100 or
less check-ins.  For example, for each frame of the sequence of frames, the image capturing process may adjust a score (e.g., the score based on a number of social network objects identified in the frame as described earlier) by multiplying the score by
the popularity coefficient of a place identified in the frame.  In another embodiment, the image capturing process may score the frames of the sequence of frames based on content of one or more voice segments recorded in the sequence of video frames. 
For example, the image capturing process may analyze content of the voice segments (e.g., by using a speech recognition algorithm) for indication of importance (e.g., "Say cheese!", "Cheese!", "This is beautiful!", "Amazing!", or simply "Capture this
picture!"), and adjust a score of a frame (e.g., the score based on a number of social network objects identified in the frame as described earlier) favorably if the frame is associated with a voice segment having indication of importance.  Yet in
another embodiment, the image capturing process may score the frames of the sequence of frames based on picture quality of the frames (e.g., lighting, contrast, facial expression, etc.).  For example, the image capturing process may analyzing picture
quality of a frame (e.g., by using an image process algorithm), and adjust a score of a frame (e.g., the score based on a number of social network objects identified in the frame as described earlier) favorably if the frame has better picture quality. 
For example, the image capturing process may analyzing picture quality of a frame (e.g., blurriness) by accessing a motion sensor (e.g., an accelerometer), and adjust a score of a frame (e.g., the score based on a number of social network objects
identified in the frame as described earlier) less favorably if the frame corresponds to a time period of significant vibration or movement of the mobile device.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the image capturing process may select one or more of the frames of the sequence of frames for persistent storage based on respective values of the frames (304).  For example, the image capturing process may rank the
frames of the sequence of frames based on the respective scores of the frames as described above, select one or more top ranked frames, and stored the selected frames in a local storage (e.g., an SD card or FLASH memory) of the mobile device.  For each
selected frame, the image capturing process may add to the selected frame's metadata ("tag") one or more social networking objects identified in the selected frame and optionally corresponding tagged regions.  In one embodiment, the image capturing
process may store a video segment (from the real-time video) covering at least the selected frames in a local storage (e.g., an SD card or FLASH memory) of the mobile device.  The image capturing process may tag one or more social networking objects
identified in the at selected frames to the stored video segment.  Additionally, in particular embodiments, the image capturing process may present the selected frames to the first user.  FIG. 3A illustrates another example graphical user interface of
the camera function of the mobile device of FIG. 2.  For example, the image capturing process can cause the camera function to display in its graphical user interface 201 selectable thumbnails corresponding to the one or more selected frames in a
scrollable media wheel panel (220) adjacent to the view finder (230).  The media wheel panel allows a user to view and quickly scroll the thumbnails corresponding to the captured image frames.  A user can select a thumbnail in the media wheel panel,
causing the camera function to display the corresponding captured image frame in graphical user interface 201 (e.g., by displaying the corresponding captured image frame within view finder 230).  In one embodiment, the image capturing process may rank
the frames of the sequence of frames based on the respective scores of the frames as described above, select one or more top ranked frames, and present the selected one or more tap ranked frames to the first user--e.g., in the scrollable media wheel
panel illustrated in FIG. 3A.  The first user may select from the scrollable media wheel panel one or more thumbnails, causing the image capturing process to store frames corresponding to the thumbnails selected by the first user in a local storage
(e.g., an SD card) of the mobile device.
<br/><br/> The image capturing process described above can be performed independently while a user accesses a camera function of a mobile device for capturing a photo, capturing a video clip, or for other purposes.  For example, the image capturing process
can be a concurring but different process from the camera application.  The image capturing process can also be performed in an "off-peak" manner.  For example, a first user may activate a camera function of a mobile device, causing a child process or a
thread of the camera application to store a real-time video captured by the camera function in a local storage (e.g., an SD card, a HDD) of the mobile device.  The real-time video stored in the local storage may comprise a sequence of video frames
including all or a portion of frames captured by the camera function while the camera function is activated.  The image capturing process hosted by one or more processors of the mobile device may access the sequence of video frames stored in the local
storage (301), analyze frames of the sequence of video frames to identify one or more social network objects (302), determine a value of the frames of the sequence of frames based on the one or more identified social objects (303), and select one or more
of the frames of the sequence of frames based on respective values of the frames (304).  The image capturing process may present the selected frames to the first user (e.g., using the scrollable media wheel panel 220 user interface described above).
<br/><br/> The example method of FIG. 3 can also be implemented by a server-side process hosted by one or more computing devices of the social networking system.  For example, a first user may activate a camera function of a mobile device, causing a child
process or a thread of the camera application to store a real-time video captured by the camera function in a local storage (e.g., an SD card, a HDD) of the mobile device.  The real-time video stored in the local storage may comprise a sequence of video
frames including all or a portion of frames captured by the camera function while the camera function is activated.  A special-purpose client process hosted by one or more processors of the mobile device may transmit the sequence of video frames to the
social networking system, causing the social networking system to store the sequence of video frames in media database 105.  The server-side process may access the sequence of video frames stored in media database 105 (301), analyze frames of the
sequence of video frames to identify one or more social network objects (302), determine a value of the frames of the sequence of frames based on the one or more identified social objects (303), and select one or more of the frames of the sequence of
frames based on respective values of the frames (304).  The server-side process may transmit the selected frames (or identifiers of the selected frames) to the mobile device, causing the special-purpose client application to present the selected frames
to the first user (e.g., using the scrollable media wheel panel 220 user interface described above).

<br/><br/> The client-side functionality described above can be implemented as a series of instructions stored on a computer-readable storage medium that, when executed, cause a programmable processor to implement the operations described above.  While the
client device 122 may be implemented in a variety of different hardware and computing systems, FIG. 5 shows a schematic representation of the main components of an example computing platform of a client or mobile device, according to various particular
embodiments.  In particular embodiments, computing platform 702 may comprise controller 704, memory 706, and input output subsystem 710.  In particular embodiments, controller 704 which may comprise one or more processors and/or one or more
microcontrollers configured to execute instructions and to carry out operations associated with a computing platform.  In various embodiments, controller 704 may be implemented as a single-chip, multiple chips and/or other electrical components including
one or more integrated circuits and printed circuit boards.  Controller 704 may optionally contain a cache memory unit for temporary local storage of instructions, data, or computer addresses.  By way of example, using instructions retrieved from memory,
controller 704 may control the reception and manipulation of input and output data between components of computing platform 702.  By way of example, controller 704 may include one or more processors or one or more controllers dedicated for certain
processing tasks of computing platform 702, for example, for 2D/3D graphics processing, image processing, or video processing.
<br/><br/> Controller 704 together with a suitable operating system may operate to execute instructions in the form of computer code and produce and use data.  By way of example and not by way of limitation, the operating system may be Windows-based,
Mac-based, or Unix or Linux-based, or Symbian-based, among other suitable operating systems.  The operating system, other computer code and/or data may be physically stored within memory 706 that is operatively coupled to controller 704.
<br/><br/> Memory 706 may encompass one or more storage media and generally provide a place to store computer code (e.g., software and/or firmware) and data that are used by computing platform 702.  By way of example, memory 706 may include various
tangible computer-readable storage media including Read-Only Memory (ROM) and/or Random-Access Memory (RAM).  As is well known in the art, ROM acts to transfer data and instructions uni-directionally to controller 704, and RAM is used typically to
transfer data and instructions in a bi-directional manner.  Memory 706 may also include one or more fixed storage devices in the form of, by way of example, hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), flash-memory cards (e.g., Secured Digital or
SD cards), among other suitable forms of memory coupled bi-directionally to controller 704.  Information may also reside on one or more removable storage media loaded into or installed in computing platform 702 when needed.  By way of example, any of a
number of suitable memory cards (e.g., SD cards) may be loaded into computing platform 702 on a temporary or permanent basis.
<br/><br/> Input output subsystem 710 may comprise one or more input and output devices operably connected to controller 704.  For example, input output subsystem may include keyboard, mouse, one or more buttons, and/or, display (e.g., liquid crystal
display (LCD), or any other suitable display technology).  Generally, input devices are configured to transfer data, commands and responses from the outside world into computing platform 702.  The display is generally configured to display a graphical
user interface (GUI) that provides an easy to use visual interface between a user of the computing platform 702 and the operating system or application(s) running on the mobile device.  Generally, the GUI presents programs, files and operational options
with graphical images.  During operation, the user may select and activate various graphical images displayed on the display in order to initiate functions and tasks associated therewith.  Input output subsystem 710 may also include touch based devices
such as touch pad and touch screen.  A touchpad is an input device including a surface that detects touch-based inputs of users.  Similarly, a touch screen is a display that detects the presence and location of user touch inputs.  Input output system 710
may also include dual touch or multi-touch displays or touch pads that can identify the presence, location and movement of more than one touch inputs, such as two or three finger touches.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, computing platform 702 may additionally comprise audio subsystem 712, camera subsystem 712, wireless communication subsystem 716, sensor subsystems 718, and/or wired communication subsystem 720, operably connected to
controller 704 to facilitate various functions of computing platform 702.  For example, Audio subsystem 712, including a speaker, a microphone, and a codec module configured to process audio signals, can be utilized to facilitate voice-enabled functions,
such as voice recognition, voice replication, digital recording, and telephony functions.  For example, camera subsystem 712, including an optical sensor (e.g., a charged coupled device (CCD), image sensor), can be utilized to facilitate camera
functions, such as recording photographs and video clips.  For example, wired communication subsystem 720 can include a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port for file transferring, or a Ethernet port for connection to a local area network (LAN).  Additionally,
computing platform 702 may be powered by power source 732.
<br/><br/> Wireless communication subsystem 716 can be designed to operate over one or more wireless networks, for example, a wireless PAN (WPAN) (e.g., a BLUETOOTH), a WI-FI network (e.g., an 802.11a/b/g/n network), a WI-MAX network, a cellular telephone
network (such as, for example, a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network, a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network).  Additionally, wireless communication subsystem 716 may include hosting protocols such that computing platform 702 may be
configured as a base station for other wireless devices.  Other input/output devices may include an accelerometer that can be used to detect the orientation of the device.
<br/><br/> Sensor subsystem 718 may include one or more sensor devices to provide additional input and facilitate multiple functionalities of computing platform 702.  For example, sensor subsystems 718 may include GPS sensor for location positioning,
altimeter for altitude positioning, motion sensor for determining orientation of a mobile device, light sensor for photographing function with camera subsystem 714, temperature sensor for measuring ambient temperature, and/or biometric sensor for
security application (e.g., fingerprint reader).
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, various components of computing platform 702 may be operably connected together by one or more buses (including hardware and/or software).  As an example and not by way of limitation, the one or more buses may include
an Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) or other graphics bus, a front-side bus (FSB), a HYPERTRANSPORT (HT) interconnect, an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, an INFINIBAND interconnect, a low-pin-count (LPC) bus, a memory bus, a Peripheral Component
Interconnect Express PCI-Express bus, a serial advanced technology attachment (SATA) bus, a Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) bus, a Secure Digital (SD) memory interface, a Secure Digital Input Output (SDIO) interface, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) bus, a
General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) bus, an Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) bus, or another suitable bus or a combination of two or more of these.  Additionally, computing platform 702 may be powered by power source 732.
<br/><br/> The present disclosure encompasses all changes, substitutions, variations, alterations, and modifications to the example embodiments herein that a person having ordinary skill in the art would comprehend.  Similarly, where appropriate, the
appended claims encompass all changes, substitutions, variations, alterations, and modifications to the example embodiments herein that a person having ordinary skill in the art would comprehend.
