<br/><br/> The present disclosure is directed to computer implemented preference rating engines, and more particularly, a computer implemented rating engine to track, recommend and promote electronic gaming machines to players.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> Electronic gaming machines, including slot machines, come in a variety of implementations with a host of different qualities, characteristics and game play.  Clearly, not every player is attracted to every game, and particular players have
preferences for particular types of games.  As a result, players tend to return time and again to their favorites.  Gauging the overall relative popularity of any particular game is fairly straightforward.  The metrics of time or money spent are
collected electronically and allow for a simple calculation of a machine or a game's popularity.
<br/><br/> However, the overall popularity of a game does not tell a particular player whether or not he or she will enjoy that game.  Players are often attracted to a limited set of games and while players' tastes in games tend to be as varied as the
individual players themselves, an individual player is attracted to games that reflect his or her own gaming preferences and styles.
<br/><br/> People with similar tastes in games can be expected to be attracted to a similar set of games.  One would expect that two players who both enjoyed the same specific game or, more preferably, games might share a similar preference for other games
similar to those games they have in common.  What is needed is a mechanism for matching a player's preferences to other games that can then be recommended to the player and allow the system or casino partners to promote the games to the players.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> In accordance with the concepts described herein, preferred embodiments of recommendation system involving a computer implemented method for generating player recommendations for electronic gaming machines is described.  The system collects data
on player history playing particular electronic gaming machines and analyzes the collected data to generate a matrix of similar games based on the player history.  The system then recommends electronic gaming machines to players based on the matrix of
similar games.
<br/><br/> In other embodiments, a recommendation system for recommending electronic gaming machines to a plurality of players is described.  The recommendation system including a database holding information on each player's history with electronic gaming
machines played by the player, the history including information on play time and bet size.  An analytics engine analyzes the information in the database and to generate a list of player recommendations personalized for each player based on that player's
history.  A player interface is provided that is accessible by each player, wherein the player interface allows the player to interact with the recommendation system and to see the personalized recommendations.
<br/><br/> The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood.  Additional features and advantages of the
invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention.  It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 1, a preferred embodiment of the game recommendation engine is shown.  Recommendation system 10 receives data from participating casinos 12 or from players 17 entering preference data, which is stored in database 11. 
Existing casino management systems 15 create player ratings and histories when a player places a player tracking card in the slot machine 13 and begins to play.  Each bet and game outcome, win or loss, is tracked by the system based on the identifying
card, which has a unique number that identifies the player to the system.  If a player keeps playing, the system keeps track of every bet creating a rating of the player's activity during that session.  Ratings end when the player removes the card and
the system closes out the session.  Time stamps are associated with card entry and card removal.  Data from the session is passed over the casino network 14 to the casino management system 15.
<br/><br/> The casino management system 15 tracks the players activity in the casino's database.  As the data is passed over the casino network 14 to the casino management system 15, applications on the casino management system 15 process and store the
data.  The system aggregates the ratings into daily and trip activity.  Marketing executives pay attention to how much the player actually loses and theoretical should lose based on the hold percentage of the game.  Complimentary services are awarded
players based on these statistics, as well as other loyalty based offers, such as cashback and free slot play.
<br/><br/> Leveraging the existing casino infrastructure, recommendation system 10 can use these casino player ratings to aid the casino in creating applications and promotions that enhance the players experience.  The ratings data provides information
related to how much the player plays on one game or a series of games.  It also provides insight into the order of the games that are played.  Since games have different play characteristics, graphics, and entertainment features, analytically we can
identify groups of players and the games they prefer.  By placing a player in a group, the system can then identify and recommend games that they may enjoy and have not yet played.
<br/><br/> In addition to using casino data, recommendation system 10 can collect data directly from players 17.  Players 17 can log into recommendation system 10 over the Internet 16 through a player interface.  Players 17 can then enter data related to
various games.  The data can be direct ratings of the games, such as one to five stars, or can be playing time data, such as is collected by the casino management system.  All of the data collected by recommendation system 10 can be stored in database
11.
<br/><br/> As described, embodiments of a game recommendation system use player ratings but can also incorporate data from different knowledge sources.  Other knowledge sources could include user feedback, game features, user item feedback, or other
relevant data.  The game recommendation system can be used as a personalized agent providing players with advice on games they may find entertaining.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 2, in preferred embodiments the game recommendation system 10 from FIG. 1 can be used by casinos to encourage players to purchase more items, gain player loyalty by building a "value-added relationship" between the casino
and the player, and can also be used to promote older and lower demanded games.  It may also extend the life of older games by adding another layer to their entertainment values.
<br/><br/> In forming feedback loop 20, the game recommendation engine can use demographic data and content data such as information about the games features, game results, and behavior of different players as found in the player ratings data 22.  The
demographic data can include data on the player's sex, age, geographic location, income, household size, and other personal information that would be relevant to the system.  Data can be entered by the player or retrieved from other external databases. 
Player based data can leverage a player-game rating matrix then make player-to-player correlations and make recommendations on games preferred by those players through an online experience 23 at a website associated with the recommendation engine. 
Leveraging the same player-game matrix, the system can make game-to-game correlations making recommendations based on those with the highest correlation.  The online experience can also be used to participate in game promotions offered by the casinos or
game manufacturers, participate in game achievements, share activities and recommendations through social media, participate in discussion boards, and access tutorials or evaluations for specific games.
<br/><br/> Through the online experience 23, game promotions and offers 24 can be used to incentivize the player to return to the casino to play more and different slots 21.  At the casino, players can access game recommendations and promotions via casino
resources such as a kiosk, casino staff, or at the club desk, or can access the information through an app on a smart phone or table or through the website.
<br/><br/> Player ratings provide a tremendous amount of data that can be used to model individual players against statistical clusters of players.  Recommendations can be based on matching a player to a particular cluster.  Once a match is made, the
recommendation can be delivered to the player via any one of the distribution channels discussed in this document.
<br/><br/> A hybrid approach can also be built leveraging demographic, player-to-game matrix delivering player-to-player correlations or game-to-game correlations, and/or the player rating model that examines the proportion of gambling activity on each
game and derives a player's place in the statistical clusters.  Any one of these models or some combination will provide reliable and meaningful recommendations to assist players in make game decisions.
<br/><br/> As described, recommendation system 10 from FIG. 1 can use the collected data, whether it be from the casino or player, to produce a "personalized" list of games that would be of interest to a particular player by matching that player's
preferences to other players with similar tastes in games, or by identifying a set of game characteristics in those preferred games and matching those to other games with similar characteristics.  A few game preferences expressed by the player as well as
the player's demographic characteristics could be used to provide the player with a list of games that would be well suited to the player's gaming tastes.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment of the system, it would be helpful to produce lists of associated games.  This list can be contingent upon first determining the degree to which play of any particular game is related to play of any other game.  This can involve
following the individual play behaviors of a large population of players over time or characterizing individual games.  The players should have access to a wide variety of games and their gaming activities for the various games they play and should be
quantified and cumulated for each player individually.
<br/><br/> In order to determine which games are among a player's favorites, it is helpful to track the play behavior of individual players.  The play behavior of a player can be monitored through player club card usage at casinos, or by direct data entry
by the players.  Club card usage might be preferable, where possible as the statistics are inherently more accurate.  When a player uses his player club card the play behavior is automatically recorded electronically.  This allows for the tracking of
player behavior over multiple sessions, over multiple machines, over an extended period of time.  Player session data, automatically captured electronically, contains relevant information regarding start and end times, play time, bets, etc., as well as
the player club ID, machine number, and site ID.  The player club ID can also be linked to other demographic information regarding the player such as age and gender.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 3, an embodiment of a screen from a browser or other interface 30 show an example of a mechanism for player interaction with the recommendation system of the present invention.  The column slot advice 31 is showing the
recommendation developed by analyzing the player's player ratings with other players' player ratings.  The player can click on the Why Wolf Run in the comments column 32 to get an explanation on why the game is being recommended.  The "why the game"
could include elements found in analyzing player experiences on Wolf Run, including the type of bonus, the volatility of the game, and why other players may like the game based on feedback collected by the site.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 4, an example of a screen 40 that show details for the player ratings logged in the system is shown.  This information includes play history 41 that shows the game type, the casino where the rating came from, the date of
the rating, session length, and points earned.  Rating 41 allows the player to provide a numerical feedback, e.g. 4 starts, on the entertainment value of that session.  Feedback 42 is a free form where the player can provide commentary on the rating. 
Player feedback can be analyzed to assist in developing and describing game recommendations.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 5, an embodiment of a screen 50 that shows a players standings relative to levels, challenges, collections or sets of games is shown.  With player ratings, the system can identify those players who play a larger proportion
of their gambling budget on the same game.  This play pattern is indicative of a level of loyalty to the game.  The promotion below encourages players to play more on a specific game by offering levels.  At each level, the player is awarded a prize and
earns a badge representing the achievement.  Levels can be optimized to reflect the level of activity the player generates individually.  In the example below, several games are identified with targets to be achieved to make the next level.
<br/><br/> The system can award virtual goods, prizes, free slot credits, entry into drawings for awards, and cash, and can include various player interfaces used to interact with the player, particularly with regard to prizes and promotions.  The player
interface is the activity that occurs on the screen or display of the user when the system recognizes a defined trigger.  The interfaces, described in Table 1 below, can be a passive animation for the player to watch or can require interaction between
the player and the system, such as selecting a box, stopping a wheel, performing a series of steps, or other interaction used for a player to claim a prize or award.  The prizes and awards can be sponsored by a casino, game manufacturer, advertiser,
product manufacturer or by the system itself.

<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 6 an embodiment of a screen 60 illustrating sets and how a casino might be configuring sets in the system is shown.  A set could be grouping of games with similar volatility, top jackpot size, bonus round, or other unique
configuration.  The Dreaming of a Big Payday promotion 61 could group all games with a progressive jackpot &gt;$100,000.  The Bonus Game Race promotions 62 groups games with similar bonus rounds.  Free Spin Promotion 63 groups games with a Free Spin
feature.  Chasing 4ofKinds 64 is a promotion grouping video poker games.
<br/><br/> In a system with full connectivity, these promotions may be tied to individual features of the game.  For example, Bonus Game Race could require player to have earned the Bonus round inherent in the game.  The Free Spin promotion could require
the player to earn Free Spins to mark that game of the promotion.  With full integration into various games, the designs of set promotions are limited only by the common features among game types.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 7 an embodiment of a screen 70 illustrating the concept of collections is shown.  Collections are designed to allow the Casino to mix match challenges, sets, and levels into a collection promotion.  In the example below, a
player should complete the set Dreaming of a Big Pay Day, earn to level 4 on Monopoly, and earn challenges on Megabucks, Millionizer, and Wizard of Oz games.  Collection promotions can sit on top of the other types of promotions such as those identified
herein.  Collections are harder to achieve and typically prizes are worth more to the player.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 8, an embodiment of a screen 80 is shown.  Screen 80 is an example representation of the badges earned by completing challenges, levels, sets, and collections.  These badges represent the players' achievements and
accomplishments.  They can be easily published to a <b><i>facebook</i></b> or other social networking service.
<br/><br/> While all the screens shown above could be displayed via the internet, kiosks, or on a hand held device, they can also be seen on the screen of a slot machine.  Referring now to FIG. 9, an example of how the information might be seen on a game
screen is shown.  The right part of the game screen is representative of the existing game screen 90 shrunk enough to make a player window appear on the left.  Game screen 90 includes pay table 92 and coin and play meter 93.  The player window 91 on the
left contains information that can be accessed by the player based on the player account which is identified via a player tracking card or via a pin and electronic account number entry.
<br/><br/> Player can choose slot advice, challenges, sets, levels, or collections and immediately see the information and promotions that are personalized to the player.  Slot advice provides the player personalized game recommendations.  The remaining
items are the individualized promotions discussed above.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 10, an embodiment of a recommendation system 10, as described in FIG. 1, is shown in more detail.  Recommendation system 10 includes database 11, which stores all the player data and the correlation data.  As described,
analytics engine 101 uses the data to generate the recommendations and relationships between players and games.  Casino interface 103 is the interface between the recommendation system 10 and the casinos and is used to gather and report player rating
data and casino promotions data.  Player interface 102 is the interface between the players and the recommendation system 10 and allows the players to interact with the system, enter data into the system, and interact with the promotions on the system. 
The promotions are controlled by promotions engine 104 which tracks the open promotions and the player status with respect to those promotions.  Message board 105 is a message board accessible by the players, allowing players to interact and exchange
information on games and related topics.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 11, an embodiment of a table showing an example of a player session data is shown.  The player session data is collected by the recommendation engine and used to perform the recommendation analysis.  Referring now to FIG.
12, an embodiment of a table showing an example of a time played matrix is shown.  The matrix shows an example of the correlations that can be calculated by the recommendation system.
<br/><br/> The game recommendations of the recommendation system according to the concepts described herein can be implemented in any number of ways to achieve the goals described above.  In preferred embodiments, the recommendation system can be
implemented to produce matrices of games that show the relative strengths of association or "affinities" of the play levels of various games in a bivariate manner based on the amount of play.  The quantification of the amount of play involves the amount
of time actively engaged in the activity, the amount of money spent on the activity, and the frequency of play.
<br/><br/> A Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Matrix meets the requirements of measuring the strength of association between all pairs of games.  Further, the correlations allow assessment of the statistical significance of the bivariate relationships. 
The matrix can be used as a preliminary basis for constructing lists of associated games or game affinities.  Factor analytic techniques can be used in conjunction with cluster analysis to identify distinct groupings of specific games based on the gaming
activities of the individuals in the sample.  A discriminant analysis can then be employed which can be used to "discriminate" among the lists of associated games using a minimal number of game preferences as well as a player's demographic
characteristics.
<br/><br/> As previously noted, each session records the play activity of a single player on a single machine.  The particular game being played during a session is not recorded directly.  In order to identify the game, the machine number and site ID are
used to access characteristics of the machine, which are maintained in database referred to as a machine table.  Manufacturer, denomination, and description are among the items that enable the game played to be identified.  Unfortunately, the machine
table entries may not point unambiguously to a standardized set of games.
<br/><br/> As embodiments of the recommendation system may rely on proper identification of which games are played, the correct assignment of machines to games is crucial.  A major task involves taking this descriptive information to relate the machines to
their respective games.  Slight differences in the descriptions as well as typos and abbreviations mean that game classification involves a great deal of processing to arrive at a set of clearly defined games.
<br/><br/> A unit of analysis for the recommendation engine is the play behavior of an individual player as defined by his PlayerID during a specified time period.  While, useful data for a significant period, i.e. the past ten years, can be used, the most
recent two years can be used to reflect "current" game affinities.  Data from other years, on an annual basis, can be used to trace historical changes in game popularity and affinities.  Gaming activity is measured by indicators which can include: time
played, coin in, theoretical win, actual win, and number of games played (individual games played belonging to the same game classification).
<br/><br/> Given N different games, the play activities for N different games are accumulated for each player.  Thus gaming activity for a player would be expressed in terms of time played (seconds) with variables TimePlayed1, TimePlayed2, .  . .
TimePlayedN.  For coin in (total $ value of wagers), the variables would be CoinIn1 through CoinInN, and finally for number of games played (of the same type), NGames1 through NGamesN.  The subscripts 1 through N indicate to which specific game the
activity totals correspond.  For each player, a record could contain sums of all the activity data from all the sessions (during the time period) associated with the PlayerID.  These sums of the TimePlayed, CoinIn, and NGames could be tallied by Game
(1-N).
<br/><br/> From each session, the activity values (TimePlayed, CoinIn, and NGames) could be assigned to the variables for that particular game.  For example, if the machine number and siteID indicated that this was Game=5 and that the session lasted 300
seconds (5 minutes), with 10.50 CoinIn and 21 games, then TimePlayed5=300, CoinIn5=10.50, and NGames5=21.  All other TimePlayed, CoinIn, and NGames subscripted variables would be set to zeros.
<br/><br/> For the analysis, all the sessions for each player (represented by his PlayerID) could be combined into a single record where the values of TimePlayed1 through TimePlayedN, CoinIn1 through CoinInN, and NGames1 through NGamesN would be sums of
their respective values from all of his sessions.  Further, this player data for each individual player is linked to other player data collected by the casino such as Gender and Date of Birth.
<br/><br/> In preferred embodiments of the recommendation system, overall game activity by game is calculated.  Games can be ranked in terms of the TimePlayed, CoinIn, and NGames measures.  Correlation matrices of the measures of activity by game type can
be presented.  As described, Pearson Product-Moment Correlation can be used to measure the strength of association between pairs of games.  Again, TimePlayed, CoinIn, Theoretical Win, ActualWin and NGames can be used as different measures of activity. 
The correlation coefficient r measures a least squares deviation from linearity between the two associated items.  The r coefficient is widely used and has the advantage of being easily interpreted.  The correlations allow assessment of the statistical
significance of the bivariate relationships.
<br/><br/> The matrix can be used as a preliminary basis for constructing lists of associated games or game affinities.  Factor analytic techniques can be used in conjunction with cluster analysis to identify distinct groupings of specific games based on
the gaming activities of the individuals in the sample.  Factor Analysis and Cluster Analysis are two prominent techniques for analyzing the patterns of a large number of interrelated variables.  Although the goals of the techniques are similar, the
analyses are very different.
<br/><br/> Factor analysis is a data reduction technique, which allows a large number of interrelated quantitative variables to be summarized into a smaller set of composite dimensions, or factors.  After grouping, variables within each factor are more
highly correlated with variables that define that factor than with variables in other factors.
<br/><br/> Cluster analysis seeks to classify a set of objects into groups or categories without knowledge of the number or the members of the groups.  In Cluster analysis, individuals or variables are grouped into clusters so that objects in the same
cluster are homogeneous and there is heterogeneity across clusters.  This technique is often used to segment data into similar, natural, groupings.  Hierarchical clustering can be used where clustering begins by finding the closest pair of variables (by
a distance measure) and combines them to form a cluster.  The clustering algorithm proceeds a step at a time, joining pairs of variables, pairs of clusters, or a variable with a cluster until all the data are in a single cluster.
<br/><br/> In preferred embodiments of the recommendation engine the analysis employs both factor analysis and cluster analysis.  The results from a factor analysis can, in certain instances, provide input for cluster analysis.  The results of the factor
analysis, the cluster analysis, and the blended method can be assessed to ascertain which technique provides the most useful results.
<br/><br/> Finally, a discriminant analysis can be employed which can be used to "discriminate" among the sets of associated games using a minimal number of game preferences as well as a player's demographic characteristics.  The sets of game affinities
are those derived using the factor analysis/cluster analysis results derived earlier.
