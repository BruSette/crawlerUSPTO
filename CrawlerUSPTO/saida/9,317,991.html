     Provisional Patent Application No. 61/802,163 filed Mar. 15, 2013,
     entitled "SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PROVIDING A BINGO GAME HAVING A SHARING
     FEATURE," which is incorporated by reference in its entirety in the
     present application.
         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  An online gaming system for providing online game play with a sharing feature, the online gaming system comprising: a game broadcaster server configured to transmit a
broadcast feed of bingo numbers for a bingo game;  a game application server configured to provide programming routines of a bingo game play engine;  a web server configured to provide graphical elements of an online gaming interface;  and an application
delivery controller in communication with a plurality of user devices, the game broadcaster server, and the game application server, the application delivery controller comprising: a processor;  and a computer-readable memory in communication with the
processor, the computer-readable memory storing instructions that when executed by the processor direct the processor to: receive a call from a user device for an online gaming interface for a bingo game;  transmit a call to the game application server
to access programming routines for the bingo game play engine;  receive from the game broadcaster server a broadcast feed of bingo numbers for the bingo game;  receive, from the web server, graphical elements for the online gaming interface;  initiate,
using the online gaming interface and the bingo game play engine, play of a bingo game having at least one initial ball call based on the broadcast feed;  transmit to a player at the user device, using the online gaming interface, an option to receive at
least one additional ball call for the bingo game;  and provide, using the online gaming interface, the at least one additional ball call to the player.
<br/><br/> 2.  The online gaming system of claim 1, the computer-readable memory further storing instructions that when executed by the processor direct the processor to: determine, using the game broadcaster server, a sequence of a plurality of initial
ball calls for the bingo game;  generate, using the online gaming interface, a representation of the sequence for play in the bingo game;  and before transmitting to the player the option to receive the at least one additional ball call for the bingo
game, automatically marking in the online gaming interface any bingo spaces of a bingo card that correspond to the plurality of initial ball calls.
<br/><br/> 3.  The online gaming system of claim 1, the computer-readable memory further storing instructions that when executed by the processor direct the processor to: before transmitting to the player the option to receive the at least one additional
ball call for the bingo game, generate, via the online gaming interface, a representation of the at least one additional ball call, wherein the at least one additional ball call is not yet playable in the bingo game;  receiving an acceptance by the
player of the option to receive the at least one additional ball call;  and after receiving the acceptance, enabling the at least one additional ball call for play in the bingo game.
<br/><br/> 4.  The online gaming system of claim 3, wherein generating the representation of the at least one additional ball call comprises: displaying, via the online gaming interface, an indication that each at least one additional ball call is locked.
<br/><br/> 5.  The online gaming system of claim 1, wherein presenting the option comprises: displaying, via the online gaming interface, an offer to the player to receive the at least one additional ball call in exchange for performing a task.
<br/><br/> 6.  The online gaming system of claim 5, wherein the task comprises transmitting a message to at least one other player.
<br/><br/> 7.  The online gaming system of claim 1, wherein presenting the option comprises: displaying, via a user interface, an option to the player to unlock at least one locked ball call.
<br/><br/> 8.  The online gaming system of claim 1, wherein presenting the option comprises: displaying, via the online gaming interface, an option to the player to become eligible to receive ball calls from other players.
<br/><br/> 9.  The online gaming system of claim 1, wherein the at least one additional ball call comprises a ball call received from another player;  and marking a bingo space based on the ball call from another player.
<br/><br/> 10.  The online gaming system of claim 9, wherein marking a bingo space based on the ball call from another player comprises: determining that a bingo card of the player has an unmarked friend bingo space;  and marking the unmarked friend bingo
space.
<br/><br/> 11.  The online gaming system of claim 9, wherein marking a bingo space based on the ball call from another player comprises: determining that a bingo card of the player does not have an unmarked friend bingo space;  and marking a numbered bingo
space of the bingo card.
<br/><br/> 12.  A method for providing online game play with a sharing feature, comprising: receiving, by an application delivery controller from a user device, a call for an online gaming interface for a bingo game;  transmitting, by the application
delivery controller to a game application server, a call to access programming routines for a bingo game play engine;  receiving, by the application delivery controller from a game broadcaster server, a broadcast feed of bingo numbers for the bingo game; receiving, by the application delivery controller from the web server, graphical elements for the online gaming interface;  initiating, by the application delivery controller using the online gaming interface and the bingo game play engine, play of a
bingo game having at least one initial ball call;  transmitting, by the application delivery controller using the online gaming interface, an option for a player to receive at least one additional ball call for the bingo game;  and providing, by the
application delivery controller using the online gaming interface, the at least one additional ball call to the player.
<br/><br/> 13.  The method of claim 12, further comprising: determining, by the application delivery controller using the game broadcaster server, a sequence of a plurality of initial ball calls for the bingo game;  generating, by the application delivery
controller using the online gaming interface, a representation of the sequence for play in the bingo game;  and before transmitting to the player the option to receive the at least one additional ball call for the bingo game, automatically marking, by
the application delivery controller in the online gaming interface, any bingo spaces of a bingo card that correspond to the plurality of initial ball calls.
<br/><br/> 14.  The method of claim 12, further comprising: before transmitting to the player the option to receive the at least one additional ball call for the bingo game, generating, by the application delivery controller via the online gaming
interface, a representation of the at least one additional ball call, wherein the at least one additional ball call is not yet playable in the bingo game;  receiving, by the application delivery controller, an acceptance by the player of the option to
receive the at least one additional ball call;  and after receiving the acceptance, enabling, by the application delivery controller, the at least one additional ball call for play in the bingo game.
<br/><br/> 15.  The method of claim 14, wherein generating the representation of the at least one additional ball call comprises: displaying, by the application delivery controller via the online gaming interface, an indication that each at least one
additional ball call is locked.
<br/><br/> 16.  The method of claim 14, wherein presenting the option comprises: displaying, by the application delivery controller via the online gaming interface, an offer to the player to receive the at least one additional ball call in exchange for
performing a task.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/>A. Introduction
<br/><br/> Inventors have recognized that, in accordance with some embodiments described in this disclosure, some types of game providers and some types of social network users, players, and/or other users, may find it beneficial to provide and/or to
participate in a bingo game that motivates (i) a user (e.g., a player of a social network game) to perform one or more actions in order to unlock one or more features of a game, and/or (ii) a user to perform one or more actions in order to unlock one or
more game features for another user (e.g., a member of a player's social network takes an action to assist the player in play of an on-line game).
<br/><br/> In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, one or more systems, apparatus, methods, articles of manufacture, and/or computer readable media (e.g., a non-transitory computer readable memory storing instructions for directing a
processor) provide for one or more of: (i) initiating play of a bingo game having at least one initial ball call; (ii) presenting (e.g., via a user interface) an option to a player to receive at least one additional ball call (e.g., in addition to at
least one initial ball call); and/or (iii) providing at least one additional ball call to a player (e.g., in response to a player accepting an option to receive the at least one additional ball call).
<br/><br/> In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, one or more systems, apparatus, methods, articles of manufacture, and/or computer readable media provide for one or more of: (i) initiating play of a bingo game providing for at least
one locked ball call; (ii) presenting an option to a player to unlock the at least one locked ball call; (iii) determining whether a player accepts or has accepted an option to unlock at least one locked ball call; (iv) unlocking one or more locked ball
calls for a player (e.g., in response to a player accepting an option to unlock locked ball calls); (v) preventing use by a player of at least one locked ball call; (vi) determining whether any unlocked ball calls are available for a player of a bingo
game; (vii) determining whether an unlocked ball call was provided to a first player by a second player; (viii) processing for a first player an unlocked ball call from a second player (e.g., in accordance with at least one game rule); (ix) determining
whether an unlocked ball call matches a bingo number of a player; and/or (x) terminating a bingo game and/or a bingo game session.
<br/><br/> In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, one or more systems, apparatus, methods, articles of manufacture, and/or computer readable media provide for one or more of: (i) determining whether a first player received a bingo
call from a second player; (ii) determining whether a player has an unmarked friend space available (e.g., on a bingo card); (iii) marking an unmarked friend space; and/or (iv) marking an unmarked bingo space that is not a friend space (e.g., selecting a
space on a bingo card to mark if all friend spaces have already been marked).
<br/><br/> In accordance with some embodiments, one or more systems, apparatus, methods, articles of manufacture, and/or computer readable media may provide for one or more of the following functions: (i) initiating play of a bingo game utilizing a bingo
card with at least one locked friend bingo space; (ii) locking at least one bingo number for a player; (iii) presenting an option to a player to unlock at least one locked friend bingo space; (iv) determining whether a player accepts an option to unlock
at least one locked friend bingo space; (v) preventing a player from receiving bingo game symbols from other users (e.g., from one or more users in a social network); (vi) receiving an identifier that identifies a user associated with a player in a
social network (e.g., a social network "friend" of a player); (vii) transmitting a message from a player to a user associated with the player in a social network; (viii) unlocking at least one locked bingo game symbol for a player; and/or (ix) unlocking
at least one locked friend bingo space for a player.
<br/><br/> In accordance with some embodiments, one or more systems, apparatus, methods, articles of manufacture, and/or computer readable media may provide for one or more of the following functions: (i) determining at least one locked bingo game symbol
(e.g., a locked numbered bingo ball, a locked bingo ball call from a friend) for a bingo game; (ii) prior to allowing a player to play the at least one locked bingo symbol in the bingo game, displaying a representation of the at least one locked bingo
game symbol in a queue; and/or (iii) after displaying the at least one locked bingo game symbol in the queue, unlocking at least one locked bingo game symbol for play in the bingo game.  In one or more embodiments, unlocking the at least one bingo game
symbol for play may comprise unlocking the at least one locked bingo game symbol in response to a player accepting an option to unlock the locked at least one bingo game symbol (e.g., in exchange for the player agreeing to perform an action).
<br/><br/> In accordance with one or more example and non-limiting embodiments, this disclosure describes, among other things, systems, apparatus, articles of manufacture, and methods for providing, facilitating and/or playing bingo games, such as a bingo
game played on a bingo card (e.g., a 9.times.9 bingo card).  Also, it will be understood that computer readable media (and apparatus comprising such computer readable media) may be configured so as to provide for one or more of the functions described in
this disclosure.  In accordance with some embodiments, at least one function or step of a described process may be performed via a user interface (e.g., presented via a display of a mobile device or other type of computing device).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, one or more special balls may be represented in a visible ball queue of balls not yet enabled for play (e.g., displayed in a visible queue with one or more other special and/or standard balls), so players can see an
indication of one or more balls that may be called, before they are called.  Some examples of bingo ball queues and associated features that may be useful, in accordance with some embodiments discussed in this disclosure, are discussed in U.S.  patent
application Ser.  No. 14,215,132, filed Mar.  17, 2014, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety in this disclosure.
<br/><br/>B. Terms and Definitions
<br/><br/> Throughout this description and unless otherwise specified, the following terms may include and/or encompass the example meanings provided in this section.  These terms and illustrative example meanings are provided to clarify the language
selected to describe embodiments both in the specification and in the appended claims, and accordingly, are not intended to be limiting.  While not generally limiting and while not limiting for all described embodiments, in some embodiments, the terms
are specifically limited to the example definitions and/or examples provided.  Other terms are defined throughout the present description.
<br/><br/> A "game", as the term is used in this disclosure (unless specified otherwise), may generally comprise any game (e.g., wagering or non-wagering, electronically playable over a network) playable by one or more players in accordance with specified
rules.  A game may be playable on a personal computer (PC) online in web browsers, on a game console and/or on a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet computer.  "Gaming" thus generally refers to play of a game.
<br/><br/> A "casual game", as the term is utilized in this disclosure (unless otherwise specified), may generally comprise a game with simple rules with little or no time commitment on the time of a player to play.  A casual game may feature, for example,
very simple game play such as a puzzle or Scrabble.TM.  game, may allow for short bursts of play (e.g., during work breaks), an ability to quickly reach a final stage and/or continuous play without a need to save the game.
<br/><br/> A "social network game", as used in this disclosure (unless specified otherwise), generally refers to (and in specific embodiments may be expressly limited to) a type of online game that is played through a social network, and in some
embodiments may feature multiplayer and asynchronous game play mechanics.  A "social network" may refer to an online service, online community, platform, or site that focuses on facilitating the building of social networks or social relations among
people.  A social network service may, for example, consist of a representation of each user (often a profile), his/her social links, and a variety of additional services.  A social network may be web-based and provide means for users to interact over
the Internet, such as e-mail and instant messaging.  A social network game may in some embodiments be implemented as a browser game, but may also be implemented on other platforms such as mobile devices.
<br/><br/> A "wagering game", as the term is used in this disclosure (unless specified otherwise), may generally comprise (and in specific embodiments may be expressly limited to) a game on which a player can risk a wager or other consideration, such as,
but not limited to: slot games, poker games, blackjack, baccarat, craps, roulette, lottery, bingo, keno, casino war, etc. A wager may comprise a monetary wager in the form of an amount of currency or any other tangible or intangible article having some
value which may be risked on an outcome of a wagering game.  "Gambling" or "wagering" generally refers to play of a wagering game.
<br/><br/> The term "game provider", as used in this disclosure (unless specified otherwise), generally refers to (and in specific embodiments may be expressly limited to) an entity or system of components which provides games for play and facilitates play
of such game by use of a network such as the Internet or a proprietary or closed networks (e.g., an intranet or wide area network).  For example, a game provider may operate a website which provides games in a digital format over the Internet.  In some
embodiments in which a game comprising a wagering game is provided, a game provider may operate a gambling website over which wagers are accepted and results of wagering games are provided.
<br/><br/> As utilized in this disclosure, the term "player" may generally refer to (and in specific embodiments may be expressly limited to) any type, quantity, and or manner of entity associated with the play of a game.  In some embodiments, a player may
comprise an entity conducting play of an online game, for example, may comprise an entity that desires to play a game (e.g., an entity registered and/or scheduled to play and/or an entity having expressed interest in the play of the game--e.g., a
spectator) and/or may comprise an entity that configures, manages, and/or conducts a game.  A player may be currently playing a game or have previously played the game, or may not yet have initiated play--i.e., a "player" may comprise a "potential
player" (e.g., in general and/or with respect to a specific game).  In some embodiments, a player may comprise a user of an interface (e.g., whether or not such a player participates in a game or seeks to participate in the game).  In some embodiments, a
player may comprise an individual (or group) that enters, joins, logs into, registers for, and/or otherwise access an online game room, session, server, and/or other particular instance and/or segmentation of an online game.
<br/><br/> Some embodiments described in this disclosure are associated with a "player device" or a "network device".  As used in this disclosure, a "player device" is a subset of a "network device".  The "network device", for example, may generally refer
to any device that can communicate via a network, while the "player device" may comprise a network device that is owned and/or operated by or otherwise associated with a player.  Examples of player and/or network devices may include, but are not limited
to: a PC, a computer workstation, a computer server, a printer, a scanner, a facsimile machine, a copier, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a storage device (e.g., a disk drive), a hub, a router, a switch, and a modem, a video game console, or a
wireless or cellular telephone.  Player and/or network devices may, in some embodiments, comprise one or more network components.
<br/><br/> As used in this disclosure, the term "network component" may refer to a player or network device, or a component, piece, portion, or combination of player or network devices.  Examples of network components may include a Static Random Access
Memory (SRAM) device or module, a network processor, and a network communication path, connection, port, or cable.
<br/><br/> In addition, some embodiments are associated with a "network" or a "communication network." As used in this disclosure, the terms "network" and "communication network" may be used interchangeably and may refer to any object, entity, component,
device, and/or any combination thereof that permits, facilitates, and/or otherwise contributes to or is associated with the transmission of messages, packets, signals, and/or other forms of information between and/or within one or more network devices. 
Networks may be or include a plurality of interconnected network devices.  In some embodiments, networks may be hard-wired, wireless, virtual, neural, and/or any other configuration or type that is or becomes known.  Communication networks may include,
for example, devices that communicate directly or indirectly, via a wired or wireless medium such as the Internet, intranet, a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), a cellular telephone network, a Bluetooth.RTM.  network, a Near-Field
Communication (NFC) network, a Radio Frequency (RF) network, a Virtual Private Network (VPN), Ethernet (or IEEE 802.3), Token Ring, or via any appropriate communications means or combination of communications means.  Exemplary protocols include but are
not limited to: Bluetooth.TM., Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Wideband CDMA
(WCDMA), Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), Digital AMPS (D-AMPS), IEEE 802.11 (WI-FI), IEEE 802.3, SAP, the best of breed (BOB), and/or system to system (S2S).
<br/><br/> As used in this disclosure, the terms "information" and "data" may be used interchangeably and may refer to any data, text, voice, video, image, message, bit, packet, pulse, tone, waveform, and/or other type or configuration of signal and/or
information.  Information may comprise information packets transmitted, for example, in accordance with the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) standard.  Information may, according to some embodiments, be compressed, encoded, encrypted, and/or otherwise
packaged or manipulated in accordance with any method that is or becomes known or practicable.
<br/><br/> The term "indication", as used in this disclosure (unless specified otherwise), may generally refer to any indicia and/or other information indicative of or associated with a subject, item, entity, and/or other object and/or idea.  As used in
this disclosure, the phrases "information indicative of" and "indicia" may be used to refer to any information that represents, describes, and/or is otherwise associated with a related entity, subject, or object.  Indicia of information may include, for
example, a code, a reference, a link, a signal, an identifier, and/or any combination thereof and/or any other informative representation associated with the information.  In some embodiments, indicia of information (or indicative of the information) may
be or include the information itself and/or any portion or component of the information.  In some embodiments, an indication may include a request, a solicitation, a broadcast, and/or any other form of information gathering and/or dissemination.
<br/><br/> A "session", as the term is used in this disclosure (unless indicated otherwise), may generally comprise (and in specific embodiments may be expressly limited to) a period of time spanning a plurality of event instances or turns of the game, the
session having a defined start and defined end.  An event instance or turn is triggered upon an initiation of, or request for, at least one result of the game by a player, such as an actuation of a "start" or "spin" mechanism, which initiation causes an
outcome to be determined or generated (e.g., a random number generator is contacted or communicated with to identify, generate or determine a random number to be used to determine a result for the event instance).
<br/><br/> As used in this disclosure, the terms "outcome" and "result" should be differentiated in the present description in that an "outcome" is generally a representation of a "result", typically comprising one or more game elements or game symbols. 
For example, in a "fruit themed" game, a winning outcome (i.e., an outcome corresponding to some kind of award, prize or payout) may comprise a combination of three "cherry" symbols.  The "result" of this outcome may be a payout of X credits awarded to
the player associated with the game.  In another example, in a game in which a character moves along a game interface from a starting position to a finish position, an "outcome" of the game may comprise a symbol representing one or more movements along
the interface and the "result" corresponding to this outcome may be the particular number and direction of the character's movement (e.g., three (3) spaces backwards such that the character ends up further away from the finish line).  In a session
embodiment, a session result may comprise a binary result (e.g., a player or game character wins or loses the session) and/or the particular award (or magnitude of award) won or earned by the player based on the session (e.g., the number of credits
awarded to the player).  It should be noted that the embodiments described in this disclosure encompass awards, prizes and payouts which are monetary, non-monetary, tangible or intangible.
<br/><br/> As used in this disclosure, the term "virtual currency" may generally refer to an in-game currency that may be used as part of a game or one or more games provided by a game provider as (i) currency for making wagers, and/or (ii) to purchase or
access various in-game items, features or powers.
<br/><br/> A "credit balance", as the term is used in this disclosure (unless indicated otherwise), may generally refer to (i) a balance of currency, whether virtual currency and/or real currency, usable for making wagers in a game and/or (ii) another
tracking mechanism for tracking a player's success or advancement in a game by deducting there from points or value for unsuccessful attempts at advancement and adding thereto points or value for successful attempts at advancement.
<br/><br/> Some embodiments are descriptive of an "array" or "matrix" of symbols or game outcomes.  As utilized in this disclosure, the terms "array" and "matrix" generally refer to a group of symbols, numbers, and/or expressions arranged in a plurality of
rows and columns (or that can be readily and appropriately represented mathematically as being so arranged).  In some embodiments, the term "array" is utilized to refer to a multi-dimensional matrix or combination of matrices while the term "matrix" is
utilized to refer to a two-dimensional set of symbols or numbers (e.g., bingo tickets, slot reel symbols and/or mathematical representations thereof).  According to some embodiments, such as in the case that an array and/or matrix is populated with
graphical game symbols, the array or matrix may be output and/or displayed (e.g., transmit to and/or rendered on a player device) as part of a game session.
<br/><br/> Some embodiments of this disclosure relate to bingo games and/or computer software applications for providing bingo games.  Some embodiments of this disclosure relate to gaming networks for providing bingo games, including social network games,
single player games and/or multiplayer games.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, a bingo game is provided in which a player uses one or more cards (or tickets, or other type of physical or electronic game play area or game space) that include symbols (e.g., alphanumeric characters and/or other
types of identifiers) assigned to respective spaces or other designated areas on the card.  One or more symbols are drawn, selected, or otherwise determined from a set of symbols available for the bingo game, and, in accordance with some embodiments, the
drawn symbols are compared to the symbols designated on the card to see if there are any matches.  It will be readily understood that a set of symbols for a bingo game may include any range of numbers, multiple ranges of numbers, a non-sequential range
of numbers, alphanumeric characters, non-numeric symbols, letters, punctuation marks, and/or any other representation of information.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, for a given bingo game, the distribution of bingo symbols across cards, and/or the distribution of the tickets across players, may be in accordance with one or more distribution algorithms and/or at random.  In
some embodiments, a bingo system generates all possible combinations of available bingo symbols as cards, and distributes all of the possible cards before distributing any repeat cards.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, if marked (or "daubed") spaces on a card form one or more previously designated arrangements (a "bingo pattern" or "winning pattern"), the card may be deemed a winning card and/or the player may be eligible for a
prize.  In one example, a player may win a prize by calling "Bingo" for a card with a winning pattern (e.g., by clicking a "Bingo" button of a game interface to indicate the player thinks his electronic bingo card includes a winning bingo pattern). 
"Daubed" or "marked" will be used synonymously in this disclosure to refer to spaces, symbols, numbers, etc., on a card that have been marked, covered, stamped, daubed, highlighted, or otherwise identified physically, visually, and/or graphically, as
potentially contributing to a winning pattern (e.g., alone or in combination with one or more other marked spaces).  In some embodiments, spaces are daubed (e.g., automatically by a gaming device and/or manually by a player) if they match symbols drawn
for a bingo game.  Alternatively, or in addition, one or more spaces may be daubed without requiring that the space match a drawn symbol (a "free" daub or mark).  For example, a card may have one or more free daubs automatically prior to the start of
play (e.g., the center square of a 5.times.5 grid may be pre-marked with a free daub) and/or anytime during play (e.g., by receiving a free random daub in accordance with a game rule).
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, a card includes spaces arranged in columns and rows (e.g., a 5.times.5 grid of spaces, a 3.times.4 array of ticket lines), each having a designated number (e.g., selected from a set of bingo numbers 1-75) represented
in a respective space on the card.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, one or more symbols for a bingo game may be associated with a symbol identifier that identifies the symbol (e.g., a unique bingo number) and with one or more types of symbol category identifiers that identify a
category, group, and/or type associated with a symbol.
<br/><br/> In accordance with one or more embodiments, a symbol category identifier may comprise a location identifier and/or a number category or group.  According to some embodiments, each symbol for a bingo game may be associated with one or more
respective location identifiers.  In one embodiment, certain symbols may be designated only in certain areas of a game card.  For example, the "B" column of a 5.times.5 card may only include numbers selected in the range of 1-15.  In another example, the
first column of a 90 ball bingo game ticket may only include numbers selected in the range of 1-10, the second column may only include numbers selected in the range of 11-20, and so on.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, in some embodiments, a given bingo symbol may be associated with both a number (or a shape, color, or other type of symbol identifier that distinguishes it from other symbols) and location information (e.g., a column identifier, row
identifier, and/or other type of location identifier) including information about where the symbol may appear on the card.  In one example, a bingo ball may be associated with the number "3" and with a "B", indicating that if it appears on a card it
would appear in a designated "B" column of spaces.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, a card for a bingo game may include one or more types of location identifiers.  Location identifiers may include, without limitation, one or more column identifiers, row identifiers, and/or other types of identifiers
that uniquely identify a particular grid space, row, column, area, or other portion of a bingo card.  For example, each column of a 5.times.5 bingo card may be identified respectively as "B", "I", "N", "G", or "O".
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, symbols may be represented (e.g., physically or electronically via a user interface) as numbered balls.  Drawn numbers themselves may be referred to in this disclosure as "balls" for illustrative purposes and
without limitation.  As used in this disclosure, a "symbol draw" or "ball draw" may be used to refer to a process for selecting or otherwise determining (e.g., at random) numbers or other types of symbols drawn for use in comparing to symbols on a card
for a bingo game.  "Drawn balls" and "drawn numbers" may be used for convenience to refer to symbols selected in a symbol draw, and it will be understood that such terms are not limited to balls or numbers, but encompass any type of symbols drawn for a
bingo game.  Those of skill in the art will realize that the symbols used in an electronic bingo game may be displayed in any convenient fashion as deemed appropriate for a particular implementation, and that a simulated ball draw is merely one example. 
The number of balls drawn and the timing of ball draws may vary according to the desired type of bingo game.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, a bingo game is played until at least one predetermined winning pattern is established on a bingo card.  In some embodiments, determining whether a winning pattern is marked properly on a card may comprise
determining whether each marked space may be compared to a set of drawn symbols to verify that it is a valid mark and therefore may qualify for or contribute to a winning pattern.  In another example, determining if a marked pattern is a winning pattern
may comprise determining whether any marked spaces are valid free daubs.  According to some embodiments, a bingo game is played until a predetermined number of winning patterns are achieved (e.g., by one or more players) and/or until a time limit
expires.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, a player must identify any matches between drawn numbers and numbers designated on the player's card(s), the player must take action to daub spaces on the card (e.g., via a user interface) in order to form
potential winning patterns, and/or the player must take action to declare a card has one or more winning patterns (e.g., by clicking a "Bingo" button).  In one embodiment, one or more daubed spaces may be undaubed by a player and/or bingo game program. 
In one example, a player may undaub a space that the player mistakenly daubed.  In some embodiments, one or more matching numbers may be daubed automatically and/or one or more winning patterns of marked spaces may be identified automatically (e.g.,
electronically by gaming device in accordance with instructions of a computer software program).  Some embodiments may provide for automatic daubing of one or more spaces (e.g., for initial free daubs and/or random free daubs during play) and for manual
daubing by the player of one or more spaces (e.g., in response to matching drawn numbers).

Google.RTM., Inc.  of Mountain View, Calif.  In some embodiments, one or more of the player devices 102a-n may be specifically utilized and/or configured (e.g., via specially-programmed and/or stored instructions such as may define or comprise a software
application) to communicate with the game server 110 (e.g., via the network 104).  In some embodiments, a game server 110 may be in communication with a variety of different types of player devices 102a-n.
<br/><br/> The network 104 may, according to some embodiments, comprise a LAN, WAN, cellular telephone network, Bluetooth.RTM.  network, NFC network, and/or RF network with communication links between the player devices 102a-n, the game server 110, and/or
the database 140.  In some embodiments, the network 104 may comprise direct communications links between any or all of the components 102a-n, 110, 140 of the system 100.  The game server 110 may, for example, be directly interfaced or connected to the
database 140 via one or more wires, cables, wireless links, and/or other network components, such network components (e.g., communication links) comprising portions of the network 104.  In some embodiments, the network 104 may comprise one or many other
links or network components other than those depicted in FIG. 1.  A second player device 102b may, for example, be connected to the game server 110 via various cell towers, routers, repeaters, ports, switches, and/or other network components that
comprise the Internet and/or a cellular telephone (and/or Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)) network, and which comprise portions of the network 104.
<br/><br/> While the network 104 is depicted in FIG. 1 as a single object, the network 104 may comprise any number, type, and/or configuration of networks that is or becomes known or practicable.  According to some embodiments, the network 104 may comprise
a conglomeration of different sub-networks and/or network components interconnected, directly or indirectly, by the components 102a-n, 110, 140 of the system 100.  The network 104 may comprise one or more cellular telephone networks with communication
links between the player devices 102a-n and the game server 110, for example, and/or may comprise the Internet, with communication links between the player devices 102a-n and the database 140, for example.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the game server 110 may comprise a device (and/or system) owned and/or operated by or on behalf of or for the benefit of a gaming entity (not explicitly shown).  The gaming entity may utilize player and/or game
information or instructions (e.g., stored by the database 140), in some embodiments, to host, manage, analyze, design, define, price, conduct, and/or otherwise provide (or cause to be provided) one or more games such as online multiplayer games (e.g.,
one or more bingo games as described in this disclosure).  In some embodiments, the gaming entity (and/or a third-party; not explicitly shown) may provide an interface (not shown in FIG. 1) to and/or via the player devices 102a-n. The interface may be
configured, according to some embodiments, to allow and/or facilitate electronic game play by one or more players.  In some embodiments, the system 100 (and/or interface provided by the game server 110) may present game data (e.g., from the database 140)
in such a manner that allows players to participate in one or more online games (singularly, in/with groups, and/or otherwise).  According to some embodiments, the game server 110 may cause and/or facilitate various functionality and/or features of one
or more bingo games, each as described in this disclosure.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the database 140 may comprise any type, configuration, and/or quantity of data storage devices that are or become known or practicable.  The database 140 may, for example, comprise an array of optical and/or solid-state hard
drives configured to store player and/or game data, and/or various operating instructions, drivers, etc. While the database 140 is depicted as a stand-alone component of the system 100 in FIG. 1, the database 140 may comprise multiple components.  In
some embodiments, a multi-component database 140 may be distributed across various devices and/or may comprise remotely dispersed components.  Any or all of the player devices 102a-n may comprise the database 140 or a portion thereof, for example, and/or
the game server 110 may comprise the database 140 or a portion thereof.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, any or all of the player devices 102a-n in conjunction with one or more of the game server 110 and/or the database 140 (e.g., via the network 104) may conduct (in whole or in part), facilitate, and/or otherwise be
associated with execution of one or more stored procedures, applications, processes, and/or methods (e.g., the methods 800 and 900 in this disclosure, and/or one or more portions and/or combinations thereof) as described in this disclosure.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments a game server 110 and/or one or more of the player devices 102a-n stores and/or has access to data useful for facilitating play of a game.  For example, game server 110 and/or a player device 102a-n may store (i) one or more
probability databases for determining one or more outcome(s) for a game, (ii) a current state or status of a game or game session, (iii) one or more user interfaces for use in a game, (iv) one or more game themes for a game and/or (v) profiles or other
personal information associated with a player of a game.  It should be noted that in some embodiments such data may be stored on the game server 110 and information based on such data may be output to a player device 102a-n during play of a game while in
other embodiments a game program may be downloaded to a local memory of a player device 102a-n and thus such data may be stored on a player device 102a-n (e.g., in encrypted or other secure or tamper-resistant form).
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, a game server 110 may comprise a computing device for facilitating play of a game (e.g., by receiving an input from a player, determining an outcome for a game, causing an outcome of a game to be displayed on a
player device, facilitating a wager and/or a provision of a payout for a game).  For example, the game server 110 may comprise a server computer operated by a game provider or another entity (e.g., a social network website).  In some embodiments, the
game server may determine an outcome for a first aspect and/or second aspect of a game by requesting and receiving such an outcome from another remote server operable to provide such outcomes.  In some embodiments, the game server 110 may further be
operable to facilitate a game program for a game (e.g., a wagering game).  In accordance with some embodiments, in addition to administering or facilitating play of a game, a game server 110 may comprise one or more computing devices responsible for
handling online processes such as, but not limited to: serving a website comprising one or more games to a player device and/or processing transactions (e.g., wagers, deposits into financial accounts, managing accounts, controlling games, etc.).  In some
embodiments, game server 110 may comprise two or more server computers operated by the same entity (e.g., one server being primarily for storing states of games in progress and another server being primarily for storing mechanisms for determining
outcomes of games, such as a random number generator).
<br/><br/> Examples of processes that may be performed by the game server 110 (directly or indirectly) may include, but are not limited to: (i) determining a set of available numbers and/or other types of bingo symbols for a bingo game; (ii) conducting a
symbol draw or otherwise determining or selecting (e.g., at random) which symbols, of a plurality of bingo symbols available (e.g., depending on the type of bingo game), are drawn for a particular round of a bingo game; (iii) transmitting an indication
of at least one drawn symbol to a player device; (iv) determining one or more drawn symbols that are in play for a bingo game (e.g., that previously may have been visible and/or queued but not yet available for play); (v) transmitting an indication of at
least one drawn and queued symbol to a player device; (vi) determining and/or transmitting (e.g., to a player device) one or more cards, tickets, or other type of bingo game space for a bingo game; (vii) determining one or more players of a bingo game;
(viii) determining and/or establishing at least one winning pattern for a bingo game; (ix) determining at least one bingo card having at least one valid winning pattern (e.g., of daubed spaces); (x) determining an outcome of a bingo game; (xi)
transmitting an indication of an outcome of a bingo game to a player device; (xii) determining one or more drawn symbols that are queued to be enabled for play in a bingo game (e.g., but are not yet available for play); (xiii) determining one or more
drawn symbols for which respective visual representations are (or are to be) made visible to one or more players; (xiv) authorizing a game program to be downloaded to a player device; and/or (xv) modifying (and/or directing a player device to modify) a
game interface (e.g., to provide for electronic gaming).
<br/><br/> A player device 102a-n may be used to play a wagering or non-wagering game (e.g., a social or casual game) over a network and output information relating to the game to players participating in the game (e.g., outcomes for a round of a bingo
game, special numbers for a player, qualifying for a level upgrade in the game, balance of credits available for play of the game, etc.).  Any and all information relevant to any of the aforementioned functions may be stored locally on one or more of the
player devices 102a-n and/or may be accessed using one or more of the player devices 102a-n (in one embodiments such information being stored on, or provided via, the game server 110).  In another embodiment, a player device 102a-n may store some or all
of the program instructions for providing one or more of the functions described with respect to game server 110 (e.g., in a downloadable software application).  In some embodiments, the game server 110 may be operable to authorize the one or more player
devices 102a-n to access such information and/or program instructions remotely via the network 104 and/or download from the game server 110 (e.g., directly or via an intermediary server such as a web server) some or all of the program code for executing
one or more of the various functions described in this disclosure.  In other embodiments, outcome and result determinations may be carried out by the game server 110 (or another server with which the game server 110 communicates) and the player devices
102a-n may be terminals for displaying to an associated player such outcomes and results and other graphics and data related to a game.
<br/><br/> It should be noted that the one or more player devices 102a-n may each be located at the same location as at least one other player device 102a-n (e.g., such as in a casino or internet cafe) or remote from all other player devices 102a-n.
Similarly, any given player device may be located at the same location as the game server 110 or may be remote from the game server 110.  It should further be noted that while the game server 110 may be useful or used by any of the player devices 102a-n
to perform certain functions described in this disclosure, the game server 110 need not control any of the player devices 102a-n. For example, in one embodiment the game server 110 may comprise a server hosting a website of an online casino accessed by
one or more of the player devices 102a-n.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a game server 110 may not be necessary or desirable.  For example, some embodiments described in this disclosure may be practiced on one or more player devices 102a-n without a central authority.  In such an embodiment, any
functions described in this disclosure as performed by a game server 110 and/or data described as stored on a game server 110 may instead be performed by or stored on one or more player devices 102a-n. Additional ways of distributing information and
program instructions among one or more player devices 102a-n, a game server 110 and/or another server device will be readily understood by one skilled in the art upon contemplation of the present disclosure.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 2, a block diagram of a system 200 according to some embodiments is shown.  In some embodiments, the system 200 may comprise a gaming platform such as a platform via which social, multiplayer, and/or online games may be
played (e.g., one or more bingo games as described in this disclosure).  In some embodiments, the system 200 may comprise a plurality of player devices 202a-n, the Internet 204, a load balancer 206, and/or a game server cluster 210.  The game server
cluster 210 may, in some embodiments, comprise a plurality of game servers 210a-n. In some embodiments, the system 200 may comprise a cache persistor 220, a Simple Queuing Service (SQS) device 222, a task scheduler 224, an e-mail service device 226,
and/or a query service device 228.  As depicted in FIG. 2, any or all of the various components 202a-n, 204, 206, 210a-n, 220, 222, 224, 226, 228 may be in communication with and/or coupled to one or more databases 240a-f. The system 200 may comprise,
for example, a dynamic database (DB) 240a, a cloud-based cache cluster 240b (e.g., comprising a game state cache 240b-1, a bingo cache 240b-2, and/or a "hydra" cache 240b-3), a non-relational DB 240c, a remote DB service 240d, a persistence DB 240e,
and/or a reporting DB 240f.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, any or all of the components 202a-n, 204, 206, 210a-n, 220, 222, 224, 226, 228, 240a-f of the system 200 may be similar in configuration and/or functionality to any similarly named and/or numbered components
described in this disclosure.  Fewer or more components 202a-n, 204, 206, 210a-n, 220, 222, 224, 226, 228, 240a-f (and/or portions thereof) and/or various configurations of the components 202a-n, 204, 206, 210a-n, 220, 222, 224, 226, 228, 240a-f may be
included in the system 200 without deviating from the scope of embodiments described in this disclosure.  While multiple instances of some components 202a-n, 210a-n, 240a-f are depicted and while single instances of other components 204, 206, 220, 222,
224, 226, 228 are depicted, for example, any component 202a-n, 204, 206, 210a-n, 220, 222, 224, 226, 228, 240a-f depicted in the system 200 may comprise a single device, a combination of devices and/or components 202a-n, 204, 206, 210a-n, 220, 222, 224,
226, 228, 240a-f, and/or a plurality of devices, as is or becomes desirable and/or practicable.  Similarly, in some embodiments, one or more of the various components 202a-n, 204, 206, 210a-n, 220, 222, 224, 226, 228, 240a-f may not be needed and/or
desired in the system 200.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the player devices 202a-n may be utilized to access (e.g., via the Internet 204 and/or one or more other networks not explicitly shown) content provided by the game server cluster 210.  The game server cluster 210
may, for example, provide, manage, host, and/or conduct various online and/or otherwise electronic games such as online bingo, slot-style games, poker, and/or other games of chance, skill, and/or combinations thereof.  In some embodiments, the various
game servers 210a-n (virtual and/or physical) of the game server cluster 210 may be configured to provide, manage, host, and/or conduct individual instances and/or sessions of available game types.  A first game server 210a, for example, may host a first
particular session of an online bingo game (or tournament), a second game server 210c may host a second particular session of an online bingo game (or tournament), a third game server 210c may facilitate an online poker tournament (e.g., and a
corresponding plurality of game sessions that comprise the tournament), and/or a fourth game server 210d may provide an online slots game (e.g., by hosting one or more slot game sessions).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the player devices 202a-n may comprise various components (hardware, firmware, and/or software; not explicitly shown) that facilitate game play and/or interaction with the game server cluster 210.  The player device 202a-n
may, for example, comprise a gaming client such as a software application programmed in Adobe.RTM.  Flash.RTM.  and/or HTML 5 that is configured to send requests to, and receive responses from, one or more of the game servers 210a-n of the game server
cluster 210.  In some embodiments, such an application operating on and/or via the player devices 202a-n may be configured in Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture with a communication manager layer responsible for managing the requests to/responses
from the game server cluster 210.  In some embodiments, one or more of the game servers 210a-n may also or alternatively be configured in a MVC architecture with a communication manager and/or communications management layer (not explicitly shown in FIG.
2).  In some embodiments, communications between the player devices 202a-n and the game server cluster 210 may be conducted in accordance with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) version 1.1 (HTTP/1.1) as published by the Internet Engineering
Taskforce (IET) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in RFC 2616 (June 1999).
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, communications between the player devices 202a-n and the game server cluster 210 may be managed and/or facilitated by the load balancer 206.  The load balancer 206 may, for example, route communications from player
devices 202a-n to one or more of the specific game servers 210a-n depending upon various attributes and/or variables such as bandwidth availability (e.g., traffic management/volumetric load balancing), server load (e.g., processing load balancing),
server functionality (e.g., contextual awareness/availability), and/or player-server history (e.g., session awareness/"stickiness").  In some embodiments, the load balancer 206 may comprise one or more devices and/or services provided by a third-party
(not separately shown in FIG. 2).  The load balancer 206 may, for example, comprise an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) service provided by Amazon.RTM.  Web Services, LLC of Seattle, Wash.  According to some embodiments, such as in the case that the load
balancer 206 comprises the ELB or a similar service, the load balancer 206 may manage, set, determine, define, and/or otherwise influence the number of game servers 210a-n within the game server cluster 210.  In the case that traffic and/or requests from
the player devices 202a-n only require the first and second game servers 210a-b, for example, all other game servers 210c-n may be taken off-line, may not be initiated and/or called, and/or may otherwise not be required and/or utilized in the system 200. As demand increases (and/or if performance, security, and/or other issues cause one or more of the first and second game servers 210a-b to experience detrimental issues), the load balancer 206 may call and/or bring online one or more of the other game
servers 210c-n depicted in FIG. 2.  In the case that each game server 210a-n comprises an instance of an Amazon.RTM.  Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service, the load balancer 206 may add or remove instances as is or becomes practicable and/or desirable.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the load balancer 206 and/or the Internet 204 may comprise one or more proxy servers and/or devices (not shown in FIG. 2) via which communications between the player devices 202a-n and the game server cluster 210 are
conducted and/or routed.  Such proxy servers and/or devices may comprise one or more regional game hosting centers, for example, which may be geographically dispersed and addressable by player devices 202a-n in a given geographic proximity.  In some
embodiments, the proxy servers and/or devices may be located in one or more geographic areas and/or jurisdictions while the game server cluster 210 (and/or certain game servers 210a-n and/or groups of game servers 210a-n thereof) is located in a separate
and/or remote geographic area and/or jurisdiction.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, for specific game types such as bingo, the game server cluster 210 may provide game results (such as a full set of drawn bingo numbers and/or bonus metrics) to a controller device (not separately shown in FIG. 2)
that times the release of game result information to the player devices 202a-n such as by utilizing a broadcaster device (also not separately shown in FIG. 2) that transmits the time-released game results to the player devices 202a-n (e.g., in accordance
with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) suite of communications protocols (TCP/IP), version 4, as defined by "Transmission Control Protocol" RFC 793 and/or "Internet Protocol" RFC 791, Defense Advance Research Projects
Agency (DARPA), published by the Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, J. Postel, ed.  (September 1981)).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the game server cluster 210 (and/or one or more of the game servers 210a-n thereof) may be in communication with the dynamic DB 240a.  According to some embodiments, the dynamic DB 240a may comprise a dynamically-scalable
database service such as the DyanmoDB.TM.  service provided by Amazon.RTM.  Web Services, LLC.  The dynamic DB 240a may, for example, store information specific to one or more certain game types (e.g., bingo games) provided by the game server cluster 210
such as to allow, permit, and/or facilitate reporting and/or analysis of such information.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the game server cluster 210 (and/or one or more of the game servers 210a-n thereof) may be in communication with the cloud-based cache cluster 240b.  Game state information from the game server cluster 210 may be
stored in the game state cache 240b-1; bingo state data (e.g., the current state of spaces (marked or unmarked) of a player's bingo card, history of called balls, information about ball call order, etc.) may be stored in the bingo cache 240b-2; and/or
other game and/or player information (e.g., progressive data, referral data, player rankings, audit data) may be stored in the hydra cache 240b-3.  In some embodiments, the cache persistor 220 may move and/or copy data stored in the cloud-based cache
cluster 240b to the non-relational DB 240c.  The non-relational DB 240c may, for example, comprise a SimpleDB.TM.  service provided by Amazon.RTM.  Wed Services, LLC.  According to some embodiments, the game server cluster 210 may generally access the
cloud-based cache cluster 240b as-needed to store and/or retrieve game-related information.  The data stored in the cloud-based cache cluster 240b may generally comprise a subset of the newest or freshest data, while the cache persistor 220 may archive
and/or store or move such data to the non-relational DB 240c as it ages and/or becomes less relevant (e.g., once a player logs-off, once a game session and/or tournament ends).  The game server cluster 210 may, in accordance with some embodiments, have
access to the non-relational DB 240c as-needed and/or desired.  The game servers 210a-n may, for example, be initialized with data from the non-relational DB 240c and/or may store and/or retrieve low frequency and/or low priority data via the
non-relational DB 240c.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the SQS device 222 may queue and/or otherwise manage requests, messages, events, and/or other tasks or calls to and/or from the server cluster 210.  The SQS device 222 may, for example, prioritize and/or route requests
between the game server cluster 210 and the task scheduler 224.  In some embodiments, the SQS device 222 may provide mini-game and/or tournament information to the server cluster 210.  According to some embodiments, the task scheduler 224 may initiate
communications with the SQS device 222, the e-mail service provider 226 (e.g., providing e-mail lists), the remote DB service 240d (e.g., providing inserts and/or updates), and/or the persistence DB 240e (e.g., providing and/or updating game, player,
and/or other reporting data), e.g., in accordance with one or more schedules.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the persistence DB 240e may comprise a data store of live environment game and/or player data.  The game server cluster 210 and/or the task scheduler 224 or SQS device 222 may, for example, store game and/or player
data to the persistence DB 240e and/or may pull and/or retrieve data from the persistence DB 240e, as-needed and/or desired.  The server cluster 210 may, according to some embodiments, provide and/or retrieve spin and/or other game event info and/or
configuration information via the persistence DB 240e.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the reporting DB 240f may be created and/or populated based on the persistence DB 240e.  On a scheduled and/or other basis, for example, a data transformation and/or mapping program may be utilized to pull data from the live
environment (e.g., the persistence DB 240e) into the reporting DB 240f.  The query service 228 may then be utilized, for example, to query the reporting DB 240f, without taxing the live environment and/or production system directly accessible by the game
server cluster 210.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, any or all of the player devices 202a-n in conjunction with one or more of the game servers 210a-n and/or the databases 240a-f (e.g., via the network 204) may conduct (in whole or in part), facilitate, and/or
otherwise be associated with execution of one or more stored procedures, applications, processes, and/or methods (e.g., the methods 800 and 900 in this disclosure, and/or one or more portions and/or combinations thereof) as described in this disclosure.
<br/><br/> Turning now to FIG. 3, a block diagram of a system 300 according to some embodiments is shown.  In some embodiments, the system 300 may comprise and/or define a "front-end" architecture of a gaming platform such as a platform via which social,
multiplayer, and/or online games may be played (e.g., one or more bingo games as described in this disclosure).  In some embodiments, the system 300 may comprise a plurality of user devices 302a-b, a plurality of networks 304a-b (e.g., a primary service
provider network 304a, a secondary service provider network 304b, a production network 304c, and/or a VPN 304d), a plurality of routers 306a-b, a plurality of firewall devices 308a-b, a plurality of game servers 310a-g (e.g., web servers 310a,
application servers 310b, messaging broker servers 310c, game broadcaster servers 310d, chat servers 310e, database servers 310f, and/or management and monitoring servers 310g), and/or an application delivery controller cluster 322.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, any or all of the components 302a-b, 304a-b, 306a-b, 308a-b, 310a-g, 322 of the system 300 may be similar in configuration and/or functionality to any similarly named and/or numbered components described in this
disclosure.  Fewer or more components 302a-b, 304a-b, 306a-b, 308a-b, 310a-g, 322 (and/or portions thereof) and/or various configurations of the components 302a-b, 304a-b, 306a-b, 308a-b, 310a-g, 322 may be included in the system 300 without deviating
from the scope of embodiments described in this disclosure.  While multiple instances of some components 302a-b, 304a-b, 306a-b, 308a-b, 310a-g are depicted and while single instances of other components 322 are depicted, for example, any component
302a-b, 304a-b, 306a-b, 308a-b, 310a-g, 322 depicted in the system 300 may comprise a single device, a combination of devices and/or components 302a-b, 304a-b, 306a-b, 308a-b, 310a-g, 322, and/or a plurality of devices, as is or becomes desirable and/or
practicable.  Similarly, in some embodiments, one or more of the various components 302a-b, 304a-b, 306a-b, 308a-b, 310a-g, 322 may not be needed and/or desired in the system 300.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a first user device 302a may comprise an electronic device owned and/or operated by a player of an online game (not explicitly shown) and/or by an entity that otherwise accesses online game content and/or services externally
(e.g., requiring external login and/or access credentials and/or procedures).  The first user device 302a may, for example, be utilized to access content provided by and/or via the application delivery controller cluster 322.  In some embodiments, the
first user device 302a may interface with and/or connect to the production network 304c via the primary service provider network 304a and/or the secondary service provider network 304b.  The primary service provider network 304a and the secondary service
provider network 304b may, for example, load balance and/or provide redundant coverage for outage recovery by utilization of a first primary service provider network router 306a-1, a second primary service provider network router 306a-2, a first
secondary service provider network router 306b-1, and/or a second secondary service provider network router 306b-2.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the application delivery controller cluster 322 may be insulated and/or protected from the production network 304c by an external firewall cluster 308a.  The first user device 302a may, for example, be required to
provide credentials to and/or otherwise access the application delivery controller cluster 322 via the external firewall cluster 308a.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the application delivery controller cluster 322 may receive via and/or from the external firewall cluster 308a and/or the production network 304c, one or more requests, calls, transmissions, and/or commands from the first

<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 7, a flow diagram of a method 700 according to some embodiments is shown.  The method 700 may be performed, for example, by a server computer (e.g., a game server).  It should be noted that although some of the steps of
method 700 may be described as being performed by a server computer while other steps are described as being performed by another computing device, any and all of the steps may be performed by a single computing device which may be a mobile device,
desktop computer, or another computing device.  Further any steps described herein as being performed by a particular computing device may, in some embodiments, be performed by a human or another computing device as appropriate.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the method 700 may comprise initiating play of a bingo game having at least one initial ball call, at 702.  In some embodiments, initiating play may comprise determining one or more ball calls to be provided to a
player (e.g., during an initial phase of the bingo game).  In some embodiments, initiating play of a bingo game may comprise determining a sequence of bingo symbols (e.g., bingo balls) by drawing symbols in accordance with any of various well known means
for determining bingo draws.  In one embodiment, initiating play of the bingo game may comprise automatically daubing (e.g., in accordance with game software instructions) any bingo spaces corresponding to the at least one initial ball call.  In some
embodiments, the number of initial ball calls to be provided to a player may be predetermined and/or determined by a server (e.g., in accordance with one or more game rule).  According to some embodiments, initiating play may comprise displaying an
indication of the at least one initial ball call to the player (e.g., via a game interface).
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the method 700 may further comprise presenting an option to a player to receive at least one additional ball call.  In some embodiments, presenting the option may comprise transmitting an indication of the option
to the player and/or transmitting an indication of an offer to the player to receive the at least one additional ball call.  In one embodiment, the offer may comprise an offer for at least one additional ball call (e.g., in addition to the at least one
initial ball call) in exchange for the player taking an action or other consideration.  In one example, the player may be required to transmit a message to another user or player.  In another embodiment, the offer may comprise an offer to provide the at
least one additional ball call to the player in exchange for the player providing a fee or other payment of value.  In some embodiments, presenting the option may comprising displaying an indication of the option to the player (e.g., via a game
interface).
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the method 700 may further comprise providing the at least one additional ball call to the player.  In one embodiment, the at least one additional ball call may be provided to the player after, or in response to,
receiving an indication (e.g., from the player) that the player accepts the option.  In some embodiments, providing an additional ball call may comprise calling, unlocking and/or enabling for play at least one bingo ball (or other representation of a
bingo game symbol) in the bingo game.  For example, after agreeing to perform a task in response to receiving an indication of an option, a player may receive five (5) additional ball calls (e.g., in addition to an initial set of five (5) ball calls for
the bingo game).  In some embodiments, a player may be able to receive more than one set of additional ball calls (e.g., in exchange for performing a plurality of corresponding tasks).  In one embodiment, providing the at least one additional ball call
to the player may comprise automatically daubing (e.g., in accordance with game software instructions) any bingo spaces corresponding to the at least one initial ball call.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, initiating play of a bingo game and/or providing an indication of at least one (initial and/or additional) ball call may comprise generating a representation of at least one bingo symbol of the queue that is not
yet playable in the bingo game.  In one or more embodiments, generating a representation of at least one bingo symbol of the queue that is not yet playable in the bingo game may comprise displaying, via a user interface, a representation of the at least
one bingo symbol in an ordered queue of symbols not yet called for play or otherwise enabled for play in the bingo game.  In one example, wherein an order in which at least two bingo balls are to be called has previously been determined (e.g., as drawn
by a game server), generating a representation may comprise displaying a sequence of a first bingo ball, followed by a second bingo ball that will be called after the first bingo ball.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, initiating play of a bingo game and/or providing an indication of at least one (initial and/or additional) ball call may comprise enabling at least one represented ball call for play in the bingo game.  In one
embodiment, enabling the at least one ball call for play may comprise calling the associated bingo symbol(s).  In some embodiments, enabling a ball call that is not yet playable, for play in a bingo game, may comprise changing a status of the ball call. 
For example, changing the status may comprise changing a status indication in a database or other data storage, from a value that indicates a ball (or other bingo game symbol) has not been called to a value that indicates the ball is or has been called. 
In some embodiments, enabling at least one ball call for play may comprise removing a bingo symbol from a first location of a user interface for the bingo game (e.g., a visible ball queue) and/or representing the bingo symbol at a second location for the
bingo game (e.g., a called ball location, call history location).  In some embodiments, enabling the at least one ball call for play may comprise advancing at least one represented bingo symbol out of a queue of balls to be called or enabled for play.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 8, a flow diagram of a method 800 according to some embodiments is shown.  The method 800 may be performed, for example, by a server computer (e.g., a game server).  It should be noted that although some of the steps of
method 800 may be described as being performed by a server computer while other steps are described as being performed by another computing device, any and all of the steps may be performed by a single computing device which may be a mobile device,
desktop computer, or another computing device.  Further any steps described herein as being performed by a particular computing device may, in some embodiments, be performed by a human or another computing device as appropriate.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the method 800 may comprise initiating play of a bingo game session having at least one locked ball call, at 802.  In one or more embodiments, a bingo session may comprise and/or be associated with at least one
locked ball call.  In one embodiment, the bingo session may be associated with at least one ball call that is locked, not enabled or otherwise not available to a player in the bingo session (e.g., until one or more conditions are met).  For example, an
indication of at least one ball call that is locked may be associated in a database with a player participating in a bingo session, with a bingo game of a bingo session and/or with a bingo session (e.g., comprising one or more bingo games).  In some
embodiments, an indication of at least one locked ball call may be transmitted and/or displayed to a player.  For example, an indication of a bingo ball with a "lock" symbol may be displayed to a player to represent a locked ball call.  In one
embodiment, the bingo session also may be associated with one or more ball calls that are not locked (e.g., an initial set of ball calls available for play in the bingo session).
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the method 800 may comprise presenting an option to a player to unlock the at least one locked ball call, at 804.  In one example, a player may be presented with an option via a user interface to unlock one or more
locked ball calls.  In one embodiment, presenting an option may comprise determining whether the player qualifies to be presented with the option (e.g., based on one or more predetermined criteria).
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the method 800 may comprise determining whether the player accepts the option, at 806.  If the player does not accept the option, the method 800 may comprise preventing use of the at least one locked ball call, at
808, and/or terminating the bingo game session, at 814.  For example, if the player elects not to unlock the at least one locked ball call, the player may be able, in accordance with some embodiments, to play any unlocked and/or initial ball calls that
may be associated with the bingo game session, before the bingo game session terminates.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the method 800 may comprise, if the player accepts the option (as determined at 806), unlocking any locked ball calls for the player, at 810.  In one embodiment, one or more locked ball calls may be predetermined
and/or previously associated with the player and/or bingo game session.  For example, a representation of one or more locked ball calls may be displayed to a player via a game interface for a bingo game.  In some embodiments, unlocking any locked ball
calls may comprise enabling at least one locked ball call for play during a bingo game session.  In one embodiment, unlocking the at least one locked ball call for player may comprise calling the associated bingo symbol(s).  In some embodiments,
unlocking a ball call that is locked may comprise changing a status of the ball call from a locked status to an unlocked status.  For example, changing the status may comprise changing a status indication in a database or other data storage, from a value
that indicates the ball call is locked to a value that indicates the ball is or has been unlocked.  In some embodiments, unlocking at least one ball call for the player may comprise changing a representation of a bingo symbol as being locked to a
representation indicating the bingo symbol is unlocked.
<br/><br/> In accordance with some embodiments discussed in this disclosure, unlocking a ball call for a player may comprise allowing a player to receive and/or to play one or more ball calls from another user and/or one or more ball calls provided by the
bingo game (e.g., in addition to one or more ball calls provided to a player initially).  In accordance with some embodiments, a ball call may be provided by or otherwise associated with another user of a game system, such as a member of a social network
of the player, or another bingo game player.  In one example, a social network friend of a player may send a ball call to a player, and unlocking a ball call may comprise allowing the player to play the ball call and/or making the player eligible to
receive the ball call.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the method 800 may comprise determining whether an unlocked ball call is available for the bingo game session, at 812.  For example, the game server may determine, after unlocking any locked ball calls for the
player (at 810), whether any unlocked ball call are currently available or may become available for the player to use for the bingo game session.  If it is determined, for example, that all unlocked ball calls have been played and/or that no other
unlocked ball calls are or will be available for the bingo game session, in accordance with some embodiments, the bingo game session terminates, at 814.
<br/><br/> If an unlocked ball call is available for the bingo game session (as determined at 812), according to some embodiments, the method 800 may comprise determining whether the unlocked ball call was provided by a friend of the player (or other type
of user), at 816.  If so, the method 800 may further comprise processing the unlocked ball call from the friend according to at least one game rule, at 818.  In some embodiments, if an unlocked ball call was received by a friend of the player, one or
more predetermined spaces associated with ball calls from friends may be daubed.  In one embodiment, predefined "friend" spaces on a bingo card may only be daubed by a ball call received from a friend of a player.  In another embodiment, a ball call
received from a friend may be associated with a bingo symbol, and, if present on a bingo card, a corresponding space may be daubed (e.g., automatically and/or by a player).
<br/><br/> After the unlocked ball call from the friend is processed (at 818), the method 800 may further comprise determining (again) whether any unlocked ball call is available for the bingo game session, at 812.  In accordance with some embodiments, the
method 800 may comprise continually and/or periodically monitoring the bingo game session to determine whether any unlocked ball calls are available.
<br/><br/> If it is determined (at 816) that the unlocked ball call is not provided by a friend of the player, the method 800 may further comprise determining whether the unlocked ball call matches a player number (e.g., of a bingo card or other bingo game
space), at 820.  In some embodiments, an unlocked ball call (e.g., a previously locked ball call associated with the bingo game session) that is not received from a friend may be associated with a bingo number.  Accordingly, in some embodiments, if the
unlocked ball call matches a player number, the player number matching the unlocked ball call may be marked, at 822.  In some embodiments, whether the unlocked ball call does or does not match a player number, the method 800 may comprise determining
(again) whether any unlocked ball call is available for the bingo game session, at 812.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 9, a flow diagram of a method 900 according to some embodiments is shown.  The method 900 may be performed, for example, by a server computer (e.g., a game server).  It should be noted that although some of the steps of
method 900 may be described as being performed by a server computer while other steps are described as being performed by another computing device, any and all of the steps may be performed by a single computing device which may be a mobile device,
desktop computer, or another computing device.  Further any steps described herein as being performed by a particular computing device may, in some embodiments, be performed by a human or another computing device as appropriate.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the method 900 may comprise determining a first player received a bingo call from a second player, at 902.  In accordance with some embodiments described in this disclosure, a player of a bingo game may receive one
or more bingo calls from another player.  For example, as discussed in this disclosure, a player may become eligible to receive ball calls and/or may unlock one or more ball calls from friends or other types of players (e.g., in exchange for agreeing to
take one or more actions).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the method 900 may comprise determining whether the first player has an unmarked friend space, at 904.  According to some embodiments, a player may have a bingo card comprising one or more friend spaces that may only be
daubed if the player receives a bingo call from a friend.  According to some embodiments, if no unmarked friend spaces are available, then, if a bingo call is received from a friend, another space may be marked.  A space may be chosen at random and/or
predetermined for marking.  Accordingly, the method 900 may comprise, if the first player has an unmarked friend space, marking the unmarked friend space, at 906.  If not, an unmarked bingo space (that is not a friend space) may be marked, at 908.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 10, a flow diagram of a method 1000 according to some embodiments is shown.  The method 1000 may be performed, for example, by a server computer (e.g., a game server).  It should be noted that although some of the steps of
method 1000 may be described as being performed by a server computer while other steps are described as being performed by another computing device, any and all of the steps may be performed by a single computing device which may be a mobile device,
desktop computer, or another computing device.  Further any steps described herein as being performed by a particular computing device may, in some embodiments, be performed by a human or another computing device as appropriate.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the method 1000 may comprise initiating play of a bingo game utilizing a bingo card with a locked friend bingo space, at 1002.  In one example, a bingo card (e.g., a 9.times.9 bingo card) comprises a plurality of
bingo spaces, at least one of which is a friend bingo space that is locked or otherwise not available for play (e.g., at the beginning of a game session).  The method 1000 may further comprise locking at least one bingo number for the player, at 1004. 
As discussed in this disclosure, in one or more embodiments, one or more bingo numbers or other type of bingo game symbols may be locked for a player (at some point in a bingo game session), but the player may be able to unlock the at least one locked
bingo number.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the method 1000 may comprise presenting an option to a player to unlock the locked friend bingo space, at 1006.  In one embodiment, unlocking a locked friend bingo space may allow a player to receive one or more
ball calls from friends.  The method 1000 further may comprise determining whether the option is accepted, at 1008.  If not, the player may be prevented from receiving bingo balls from friends (e.g., for the remainder of a bingo game session), at 1010.
<br/><br/> If, on the other hand, the option is accepted (at 1008), the method 1000 may further comprise receiving an identifier that identifies a friend of a player.  In one example, a game server may receive (e.g., via a user interface), an identifier of
a friend of a player in a social network, the friend being selected by the player (e.g., from a list of friends in the social network).  The method 1000 may further comprise transmitting a message from the player to the friend.  In one embodiment, the
player may accept the option to unlock the locked friend bingo space by agreeing to transmit a message to one or more friends.  In this way, some embodiments may provide advantageously for encouraging a player of a bingo game to promote and/or recommend
the bingo game to another player and/or to promote participation in a social network (e.g., that is associated with the bingo game).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the method 1000 may further comprise unlocking at least one bingo number for the player, at 1016, and/or may further comprise unlocking the locked friend bingo space, at 1018.  As discussed above, one or more locked friend
bingo spaces may be unlocked after and/or in response to determining that an option to unlock locked friend bingo spaces is accepted.  According to some embodiments, at least one bingo number (e.g., associated with a locked bingo call and/or additional
bingo calls) may be unlocked for a player.  In one example, the option to the player to unlock the locked friend bingo space may also comprise or be associated with an option to unlock at least one locked bingo number or bingo call, as discussed in this
disclosure with respect to various embodiments.
<br/><br/>E. Example Interfaces and Applications
<br/><br/> Any or all of methods 700, 800, 900, 1000 and/or other methods described in this disclosure may involve one or more interfaces.  One or more of such methods may include, in some embodiments, providing an interface by and/or through which a user
may play a bingo game.  Although certain types of information are illustrated in the example interfaces, those skilled in the art will understand that the interfaces may be modified in order to provide for additional types of information and/or to remove
some of the illustrated types of information, as deemed desirable for a particular implementation.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 11A-11H depict an example of play of a bingo game as presented via an example interface 1100 for a game application providing for play of a bingo game (e.g., an online bingo game or a social network game played over the Internet), in
accordance with one or more embodiments discussed in this disclosure.  FIG. 11A illustrates the example interface 1100 presenting a first time during play of a bingo game.  The example interface 1100, as depicted, includes a bingo card 1102, a bingo
scoreboard 1103, and a ball queue 1104.  The bingo scoreboard 1103 includes representations of various levels of progress for the bingo game (e.g., 1-5 bingos achieved, 6-10 bingos achieved, a total blackout of the bingo card).
<br/><br/> The example bingo card 1102 includes an example 9.times.9 bingo card that, as depicted, has two daubed spaces (in the third and fourth rows), a plurality of friend ball spaces 1114a-d, and an example numbered bingo card space 1116 ("98") that
corresponds to the bingo ball represented in active ball area 1106.  The example ball queue 1104 includes a representation of friend balls 1110a-c and locked balls 1108-a-b. The example interface 1110 further includes representations of called bingo
balls 1112a-b.
<br/><br/> As depicted in the example interface 1100 of FIG. 11A, a bingo ball ("98") represented in active ball area 1106 has advanced out of the queue (e.g., after initial balls 1112a and 1112b were called).  FIG. 11B illustrates another example of
interface 1100 in which the active ball area 1106 has been modified to indicate that the "98" ball that advanced out of the ball queue 1104 is a locked ball.  Similarly, the example numbered bingo card space 1116 in the example interface 1100 of FIG. 11B
indicates that the space is locked or otherwise not able to be daubed.  As discussed with respect to some embodiments in this disclosure, the player may be required to satisfy one or more conditions in order to receive or be eligible to receive one or
more additional ball calls and/or in order to unlock one or more locked bingo ball calls.  As depicted in FIG. 11B, the player is required to perform the example action of "Share to Unlock" in order to unlock the locked "98" ball represented at active
ball area 1106.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11C illustrates another example of interface 1100, after or upon the "98" being displayed as locked on the bingo card 1102 and/or at the active ball area 1106.  As depicted in FIG. 11C, an option message 1120 to unlock three more balls for
play in the day's bingo game session is presented to the player via the example interface 1100.  In the example option message 1120, the player is offered the opportunity to receive the additional balls in exchange for helping his friends.  The displayed
option message also includes an OK button 1122 for accepting the option, and a No Thanks button for declining the option.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11D illustrates another example of interface 1100, after or upon the player accepting the option for more balls (e.g., upon actuating the displayed OK button 1122 in FIG. 11C).  As depicted in FIG. 11D, the player is presented with a list
1130 of social network friends (or other users of a game system or social network).  The example interface 1100 of FIG. 11D also includes a selected friends area 1132 indicating friends the player has selected to receive a message, a Bingo Friends button
1138 for populating a list of friends in a network of bingo game players, an Add Friends button 1140 for initiating functionality by which a player may add one or more friends to his social network, a Search button 1142 for initiating a search function
to search for friends in the player's social network, and a Select 10 element 1144 for initiating a function to have the game program automatically select ten (10) friends (e.g., at random) from all of the player's social network friends.
<br/><br/> The example interface 1100 of FIG. 11D further includes a Share button 1134 for initiating a function send a message to the selected friends (e.g., the friends indicated in the selected friends area 1132), and a Skip button 1136 for cancelling
the message sharing function (e.g., to decline the option to unlock additional ball calls).
<br/><br/> FIG. 11E illustrates another example of interface 1100, after or upon the player actuating the Share button 1134 in FIG. 11D.  As depicted in FIG. 11E, the player is presented with an opportunity to input a message to the selected friends via
message field 1150.  The example interface 1100 also allows a player to select one or more of the friends selected in the friend selection process depicted in FIG. 11D to receive the message, by clicking the respective button associated with the one or
more friends 1152, or to tag all of the displayed friends to receive the message by selecting the example Tag All button 1154.  The example interface 1100 also includes an example Share with Friends button 1156 for initiating the transmission of the
message to the selected friends and/or for confirming acceptance of the option to receive one or more additional balls, and an example Don't Share button 1158 for allowing the player to cancel out of the message sharing function.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11F illustrates another example of interface 1100, after or upon the player actuating the Share with Friends button 1156 in FIG. 11E.  As depicted in FIG. 11F, the example interface 1100 provides an example animation of a lock 1160 being
removed from the active ball area 1106 to indicate that the player has unlocked the "98" ball and that the other previously locked balls 1108a-b are now unlocked and available for play in the example bingo game session.  Accordingly, the player has
received three more balls for play of the game by accepting the option and performing the requested task of sending a message to friends.  As depicted in FIG. 11F the example numbered bingo space 1116 has been daubed (e.g., automatically or by the
player) as a result of the corresponding ball call being unlocked.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11G illustrates another example of interface 1100, after or upon the player unlocking additional ball calls and/or unlocking the ability to receive ball calls from friends.  The example interface 1100 includes an example message 1106
indicating that three friends have shared ball calls with the player.  As discussed above, a player's acceptance of an option to unlock one or more additional ball calls may make the player eligible to receive one or more ball calls from friends that the
player would not otherwise have been able to play (e.g., in that day's session of the bingo game).
<br/><br/> FIG. 11H illustrates another example of interface 1100, after or upon one of the previously unavailable friend ball calls being unlocked for play and/or after unlocking one or more of the example locked friend bingo squares.  As depicted, the
bingo square 1180 has been unlocked and daubed based on an unlocked ball call from a friend.
<br/><br/>F. Additional Embodiments
<br/><br/> While some embodiments described in this disclosure may make advantageous use of the visible ball queue by including one or more special balls, special balls are not required to be used with a visible ball queue, and no individual special ball
is required to validate the advantages of the visible ball queue functionality.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, players may be able to interact with a displayed ball queue on an individual and/or communal or group level.  According to one embodiment, one or more players may indicate one or more balls (e.g., in a visible
queue) that the respective player would like to be a special ball (e.g., to become associated with one or more special functions).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a player may be able to indicate (e.g., in a voting or other selection process via a user interface) one or more balls in a visible queue the player wants to advance in the queue (e.g., to the front of the queue).  In some
embodiments, a bingo system may take the collective results of a plurality of players (e.g., the votes of a community or team) and subsequently modify the sequence of balls in the ball queue based on the collective results.  In one embodiment, players
may vote (e.g., via a user interface) for which ball to advance in a visible queue displaying two or more upcoming ball calls.  The order of balls in a queue (e.g., displayed in a visible queue) may be determined (e.g., re-ordered by a controller of the
bingo system) based on how many players voted for each of the balls, with the ball receiving the most votes moving to the front of the queue, the ball receiving the second most amount of votes moving to the second spot in the queue, and so on.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, a player may indicate (e.g., via a user interface) one or more balls in a visible queue to which the player would like a win multiplier applied (e.g., if the player wins with the associated number, the player will
win a multiplier on the resulting payout).  In some embodiments, a bingo system may use the respective selections of a plurality of players (e.g., the votes of a community or team) to determine at least one ball with which to associate a win multiplier
based on the selections of the plurality of players.  In one embodiment, a controller of a bingo system may apply a win multiplier to one or more balls (e.g., by updating the displayed indication of a ball in a queue to represent the associated
multiplier; by updating an associated record in a database) based on the respective selections of one or more players.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, one or more plays of a bingo game may be purchased (e.g., by a player) from, or otherwise made available (e.g., to players), via a central controller or bingo system.  In one embodiment, game plays are available for purchase
from an online service provider such as a web-based retailer and/or social networking service (e.g. via a software application associated with a social networking web site).
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, information associated with one or more bingo games (including, for example, indications of payout amount(s), result(s), associated players or purchasers), may be transmitted to, received by and stored by a player
device (e.g., a computer, a cell phone, etc.).
<br/><br/> According to one example implementation of an example bingo game, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, an on-line bingo game is provided by a game provider as a daily bonus game.  Players of the example game receive a
9.times.9 bingo card at the beginning of each week of play (e.g., each Monday morning).  Each player receives a predetermined number of free ball calls (e.g., five initial ball calls) per day (e.g., and the corresponding numbers are automatically daubed
on their cards).
<br/><br/> According to the example game, players may unlock one or more extra ball calls by performing a task, such as sending one or more "friend balls" to their friends.  Players have until the end of a predetermined period of time (e.g., a week) to
complete as many winning bingo patterns as possible.  For instance, the ultimate aim may be for the player to complete a "blackout" pattern on the bingo card.  In one example, prizes may be awarded to a player at the end of the gaming session (e.g.,
after midnight on the Sunday following a game's start on Monday) and may be based on the number of bingos achieved on the card.
<br/><br/> According to one example implementation of an example bingo game, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, an on-line bingo game is provided by a game provider as a daily bonus game.  According to the example implementation,
on a player's first session of each day the daily game (referred to as "Mega Bingo" in this example) opens automatically (e.g., in response to a player logging in to a game server) and a predetermined number of balls (e.g., as set or determined by a game
provider) are called.  Before, after, and/or at any time during play of the initial ball calls, a player may be presented with or otherwise given the option to send bingo balls to their friends and/or other types of users in order to unlock more ball
calls (e.g., for the daily session).
<br/><br/> According to this example implementation, if a player does not decide to share bingo ball calls with other users, play of the day's session of the week-long game is terminated (e.g., after all matches from the initial ball calls are daubed, as
appropriate).  In one example, the player may be sent to a game lobby or other type of user interface of a game provider.  According to the example implementation, a player who does not elect to share ball calls does not get a chance subsequently to
change his mind until the next session (e.g., until the next day's session of the daily game).  Further, in some embodiments, the player also cannot receive any ball calls shared by his or her friends that day.  In some embodiments, up to a predetermined
number of shared ball calls (e.g., ten) shared with a player by the player's friends may be stored (e.g., in a database in association with the player's profile) and may be utilized in a later session.  For instance, should the player opt to share ball
calls later in the week, the player may receive one or more of the stored balls.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments of the example Mega Bingo game implementation, if a player does decide to share: They can select up to ten (10) friends to "Share" Mega Bingo balls with.  They must tag at least one of these friends in a
personalized message.  This message will appear on the player's timeline who is sharing and the timelines of all those who he/she has tagged.  The remaining balls in the ball tube will be unlocked, meaning that these players receive a far higher number
of ball calls per day than players who do not share.  They will be able to receive Mega Bingo Balls from their friends throughout the day (though the number of these has a configurable cap) By "sending" a Mega Bingo ball to a friend a player is not
sending a specifically numbered ball.  They are sending them an extra ball call.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments of the example Mega Bingo game implementation, each Mega Bingo bingo card may include a configurable number of "Friend Squares".  A "Friend Square" can only be daubed by a Mega Bingo ball that has been sent to you
by a friend, and the squares are not associated with a number.  All friend balls received will be numberless and will automatically fill these squares until they are all daubed.  In some embodiments, extra or subsequent Mega Bingo balls sent to a player
by his friends will assume a number (e.g., and act as a standard ball call).
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments of the example Mega Bingo game implementation, if a player does not "share" Mega Bingo balls with their friends they will not be able to receive friend balls, thus their Friend Squares will not be daubed.  If a
player does share Mega Bingo balls but does not receive any back they will not be able to fill their Friend Squares.  If a player does not manage to fill their Friend Squares they will be prevented from completing several possible bingos and the
blackout.  Without these squares players could still potentially win a handful of bingos by the end of the week.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments of the example Mega Bingo game implementation, Friend Squares can appear in any pattern, on any square of a Mega Bingo card, and there is not a minimum or maximum amount of Friend Squares required per card.  In one
example, Friend Squares may appear in the same place on the cards of all Bingo Lane players each week.  In one embodiment, once a Friend Square is daubed the profile picture of the friend who sent you the ball remains on the square.
<br/><br/>INTERPRETATION
<br/><br/> Numerous embodiments are described in this patent application, and are presented for illustrative purposes only.  The described embodiments are not, and are not intended to be, limiting.  The presently disclosed invention(s) are widely
applicable to numerous embodiments, as is readily apparent from the disclosure.  One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the disclosed invention(s) may be practiced with various modifications and alterations, such as structural, logical,
software, and electrical modifications.  Although particular features of the disclosed invention(s) may be described with reference to one or more particular embodiments and/or drawings, it should be understood that such features are not limited to usage
in the one or more particular embodiments or drawings with reference to which they are described, unless expressly specified otherwise.
<br/><br/> The present disclosure is neither a literal description of all embodiments of the invention nor a listing of features of the invention that must be present in all embodiments.  It is contemplated, however, that while some embodiment are not
limited by the examples provided herein, some embodiments may be specifically bounded or limited by provided examples, structures, method steps, and/or sequences.  Embodiments having scopes limited by provided examples may also specifically exclude
features not explicitly described or contemplated.
<br/><br/> Neither the Title (set forth at the beginning of the first page of this patent application) nor the Abstract (set forth at the end of this patent application) is to be taken as limiting in any way the scope of the disclosed invention(s).
<br/><br/> The term "product" means any machine, manufacture and/or composition of matter as contemplated by 35 U.S.C.  .sctn.101, unless expressly specified otherwise.
<br/><br/> The terms "an embodiment", "embodiment", "embodiments", "the embodiment", "the embodiments", "one or more embodiments", "some embodiments", "one embodiment" and the like mean "one or more (but not all) disclosed embodiments", unless expressly
specified otherwise.
<br/><br/> A reference to "another embodiment" in describing an embodiment does not imply that the referenced embodiment is mutually exclusive with another embodiment (e.g., an embodiment described before the referenced embodiment), unless expressly
specified otherwise.  Similarly, any reference to an "alternate", "alternative", and/or "alternate embodiment" is intended to connote one or more possible variations--not mutual exclusivity.  In other words, it is expressly contemplated that
"alternatives" described herein may be utilized and/or implemented together, unless they inherently are incapable of being utilized together.
<br/><br/> The terms "including", "comprising" and variations thereof mean "including but not limited to", unless expressly specified otherwise.
<br/><br/> The terms "a", "an" and "the" mean "one or more", unless expressly specified otherwise.
<br/><br/> The term "plurality" means "two or more", unless expressly specified otherwise.
<br/><br/> The term "herein" means "in the present application, including the specification, its claims and figures, and anything which may be incorporated by reference, unless expressly specified otherwise.
<br/><br/> The phrase "at least one of", when such phrase modifies a plurality of things (such as an enumerated list of things) means any combination of one or more of those things, unless expressly specified otherwise.  For example, the phrase at least
one of a widget, a car and a wheel means (i) a widget, (ii) a car, (iii) a wheel, (iv) a widget and a car, (v) a widget and a wheel, (vi) a car and a wheel, or (vii) a widget, a car and a wheel.
<br/><br/> The phrase "based on" does not mean "based only on", unless expressly specified otherwise.  In other words, the phrase "based on" describes both "based only on" and "based at least on".  In some embodiments, a first thing being "based on" a
second thing refers specifically to the first thing taking into account the second thing in an explicit manner.  In such embodiments, for example, a processing step based on the local weather, which itself is in some manner based on or affected by (for
example) human activity in the rainforests, is not "based on" such human activities because it is not those activities that being explicitly analyzed, included, taken into account, and/or processed.
<br/><br/> The term "whereby" is used herein only to precede a clause or other set of words that express only the intended result, objective or consequence of something that is previously and explicitly recited.  Thus, when the term "whereby" is used in a
claim, the clause or other words that the term "whereby" modifies do not establish specific further limitations of the claim or otherwise restricts the meaning or scope of the claim.
<br/><br/> The term "wherein", as utilized herein, does not evidence intended use.  The term "wherein" expressly refers to one or more features inclusive in a particular embodiment and does not imply or include an optional or conditional limitation.
<br/><br/> Where a limitation of a first claim would cover one of a feature as well as more than one of a feature (e.g., a limitation such as "at least one widget" covers one widget as well as more than one widget), and where in a second claim that depends
on the first claim, the second claim uses a definite article "the" to refer to the limitation (e.g., "the widget"), this does not imply that the first claim covers only one of the feature, and this does not imply that the second claim covers only one of
the feature (e.g., "the widget" can cover both one widget and more than one widget).
<br/><br/> When an ordinal number (such as "first", "second", "third" and so on) is used as an adjective before a term, that ordinal number is used (unless expressly specified otherwise) merely to indicate a particular feature, such as to allow for
distinguishing that particular referenced feature from another feature that is described by the same term or by a similar term.  For example, a "first widget" may be so named merely to allow for distinguishing it in one or more claims from a "second
widget", so as to encompass embodiments in which (1) the "first widget" is or is the same as the "second widget" and (2) the "first widget" is different than or is not identical to the "second widget".  Thus, the mere usage of the ordinal numbers "first"
and "second" before the term "widget" does not indicate any other relationship between the two widgets, and likewise does not indicate any other characteristics of either or both widgets.  For example, the mere usage of the ordinal numbers "first" and
"second" before the term "widget" (1) does not indicate that either widget comes before or after any other in order or location; (2) does not indicate that either widget occurs or acts before or after any other in time; (3) does not indicate that either
widget ranks above or below any other, as in importance or quality; and (4) does not indicate that the two referenced widgets are not identical or the same widget.  In addition, the mere usage of ordinal numbers does not define a numerical limit to the
features identified with the ordinal numbers.  For example, the mere usage of the ordinal numbers "first" and "second" before the term "widget" does not indicate that there must be no more than two widgets.
<br/><br/> When a single device or article is described herein, more than one device or article (whether or not they cooperate) may alternatively be used in place of the single device or article that is described.  Accordingly, the functionality that is
described as being possessed by a device may alternatively be possessed by more than one device or article (whether or not they cooperate).
<br/><br/> Similarly, where more than one device or article is described herein (whether or not they cooperate), a single device or article may alternatively be used in place of the more than one device or article that is described.  For example, a
plurality of computer-based devices may be substituted with a single computer-based device.  Accordingly, the various functionality that is described as being possessed by more than one device or article may alternatively be possessed by a single device
or article.
<br/><br/> The functionality and/or the features of a single device that is described may be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices which are described but are not explicitly described as having such functionality and/or features.  Thus, other
embodiments need not include the described device itself, but rather can include the one or more other devices which would, in those other embodiments, have such functionality/features.
<br/><br/> Devices that are in communication with each other need not be in continuous communication with each other, unless expressly specified otherwise.  On the contrary, such devices need only transmit to each other as necessary or desirable, and may
actually refrain from exchanging data most of the time.  For example, a machine in communication with another machine via the Internet may not transmit data to the other machine for weeks at a time.  In addition, devices that are in communication with
each other may communicate directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.
<br/><br/> A description of an embodiment with several components or features does not imply that all or even any of such components and/or features are required.  On the contrary, a variety of optional components are described to illustrate the wide
variety of possible embodiments of the present invention(s).  Unless otherwise specified explicitly, no component and/or feature is essential or required.
<br/><br/> Further, although process steps, algorithms or the like may be described in a sequential order, such processes may be configured to work in different orders.  In other words, any sequence or order of steps that may be explicitly described does
not necessarily indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order.  The steps of processes described herein may be performed in any order practical.  Further, some steps may be performed simultaneously despite being described or implied as
occurring non-simultaneously (e.g., because one step is described after the other step).  Moreover, the illustration of a process by its depiction in a drawing does not imply that the illustrated process is exclusive of other variations and modifications
thereto, does not imply that the illustrated process or any of its steps are necessary to the invention, and does not imply that the illustrated process is preferred.
<br/><br/> Although a process may be described as including a plurality of steps, that does not indicate that all or even any of the steps are essential or required.  Various other embodiments within the scope of the described invention(s) include other
processes that omit some or all of the described steps.  Unless otherwise specified explicitly, no step is essential or required.
<br/><br/> Although a product may be described as including a plurality of components, aspects, qualities, characteristics and/or features, that does not indicate that all of the plurality are essential or required.  Various other embodiments within the
scope of the described invention(s) include other products that omit some or all of the described plurality.
<br/><br/> An enumerated list of items (which may or may not be numbered) does not imply that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive, unless expressly specified otherwise.  Likewise, an enumerated list of items (which may or may not be numbered)
does not imply that any or all of the items are comprehensive of any category, unless expressly specified otherwise.  For example, the enumerated list "a computer, a laptop, a PDA" does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are
mutually exclusive and does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are comprehensive of any category.
<br/><br/> Headings of sections provided in this patent application and the title of this patent application are for convenience only, and are not to be taken as limiting the disclosure in any way.
<br/><br/> "Determining" something can be performed in a variety of manners and therefore the term "determining" (and like terms) includes calculating, computing, deriving, looking up (e.g., in a table, database or data structure), ascertaining and the
like.
<br/><br/> It will be readily apparent that the various methods and algorithms described herein may be implemented by, e.g., appropriately and/or specially-programmed general purpose computers and/or computing devices.  Typically a processor (e.g., one or
more microprocessors) will receive instructions from a memory or like device, and execute those instructions, thereby performing one or more processes defined by those instructions.  Further, programs that implement such methods and algorithms may be
stored and transmitted using a variety of media (e.g., computer readable media) in a number of manners.  In some embodiments, hard-wired circuitry or custom hardware may be used in place of, or in combination with, software instructions for
implementation of the processes of various embodiments.  Thus, embodiments are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software
<br/><br/> A "processor" generally means any one or more microprocessors, CPU devices, computing devices, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, or like devices, as further described herein.  According to some embodiments, a "processor" may primarily
comprise and/or be limited to a specific class of processors referred to herein as "processing devices".  "Processing devices" are a subset of processors limited to physical devices such as CPU devices, Printed Circuit Board (PCB) devices, transistors,
capacitors, logic gates, etc. "Processing devices", for example, explicitly exclude biological, software-only, and/or biological or software-centric physical devices.  While processing devices may include some degree of soft logic and/or programming, for
example, such devices must include a predominant degree of physical structure in accordance with 35 U.S.C.  .sctn.101.
<br/><br/> The term "computer-readable medium" refers to any medium that participates in providing data (e.g., instructions or other information) that may be read by a computer, a processor or a like device.  Such a medium may take many forms, including
but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media.  Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory.  Volatile media include DRAM, which typically constitutes the main memory. 
Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise a system bus coupled to the processor.  Transmission media may include or convey acoustic waves, light waves and electromagnetic emissions, such as
those generated during RF and IR data communications.  Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical medium, punch
cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.
<br/><br/> The term "computer-readable memory" may generally refer to a subset and/or class of computer-readable medium that does not include transmission media such as waveforms, carrier waves, electromagnetic emissions, etc. Computer-readable memory may
typically include physical media upon which data (e.g., instructions or other information) are stored, such as optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory, DRAM, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic
medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, computer hard drives, backup tapes, Universal Serial
Bus (USB) memory devices, and the like.
<br/><br/> Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying data, including sequences of instructions, to a processor.  For example, sequences of instruction (i) may be delivered from RAM to a processor, (ii) may be carried over a
wireless transmission medium, and/or (iii) may be formatted according to numerous formats, standards or protocols, such as Bluetooth.TM., TDMA, CDMA, 3G.
<br/><br/> Where databases are described, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that (i) alternative database structures to those described may be readily employed, and (ii) other memory structures besides databases may be readily
employed.  Any illustrations or descriptions of any sample databases presented herein are illustrative arrangements for stored representations of information.  Any number of other arrangements may be employed besides those suggested by, e.g., tables
illustrated in drawings or elsewhere.  Similarly, any illustrated entries of the databases represent exemplary information only; one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the number and content of the entries can be different from those
described herein.  Further, despite any depiction of the databases as tables, other formats (including relational databases, object-based models and/or distributed databases) could be used to store and manipulate the data types described herein. 
Likewise, object methods or behaviors of a database can be used to implement various processes, such as the described herein.  In addition, the databases may, in a known manner, be stored locally or remotely from a device that accesses data in such a
database.
<br/><br/> The present invention can be configured to work in a network environment including a computer that is in communication, via a communications network, with one or more devices.  The computer may communicate with the devices directly or
indirectly, via a wired or wireless medium such as the Internet, LAN, WAN or Ethernet, Token Ring, or via any appropriate communications means or combination of communications means.  Each of the devices may comprise computers, such as those based on the
Intel.RTM.  Pentium.RTM.  or Centrino.TM.  processor, that are adapted to communicate with the computer.  Any number and type of machines may be in communication with the computer.
<br/><br/> The present disclosure provides, to one of ordinary skill in the art, an enabling description of several embodiments and/or inventions.  Some of these embodiments and/or inventions may not be claimed in the present application, but may
nevertheless be claimed in one or more continuing applications that claim the benefit of priority of the present application.  Applicants intend to file additional applications to pursue patents for subject matter that has been disclosed and enabled but
not claimed in the present application.
