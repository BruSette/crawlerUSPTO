<br/><br/> The present invention relates to functional and decorative lighting.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> There are several means for displaying and supplying information, such as, e.g., signs, posters, television, interactive screens, etc. It is generally desired that the information is displayed both clearly and decoratively.
<br/><br/> Usually, the means used for displaying information is quite static.  Once installed, it is not easily expandable, and when not in use, it may constitute a quite ugly piece such as, e.g., a huge television set.
<br/><br/> There is thus a need to improve the means used for displaying information in terms of flexibility, etc.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> It is an object of the present invention to overcome this problem, and to provide lighting that is decorative.  It is a secondary object to provide lighting that is functional.
<br/><br/> According to a first aspect of the invention, this and other objects are achieved by a control device for controlling at least one lighting effect of at least one lighting element of a plurality of interconnected lighting elements, wherein the
control device is arranged to be connected to a lighting element chosen from the plurality of interconnected lighting elements, and wherein the control device, when it is connected to said lighting element, is arranged to control said at least one
lighting effect of at least one lighting element of the plurality of interconnected lighting elements.
<br/><br/> The control device is connectable to any one of the plurality of lighting elements, which is advantageous in that very flexible lighting is achieved, since it is easily extendible and scalable.  Furthermore, no central control is necessary. 
Instead, the position of the control depends on the position of the control device.

<br/><br/> The person skilled in the art realizes that the present invention by no means is limited to the preferred embodiments described above.  On the contrary, many modifications and variations are possible within the scope of the appended claims.  For
example, different lighting effects can be generated by adjusting different switches.  Alternatively, the lighting effects can be pre-set so that lighting effects are predetermined for every control device such as, e.g., sunrise and sunset.
<br/><br/> The control device may comprise a storage means and a processing means.
<br/><br/> The lighting effect generated by the control device may be dependent on the position of the control device, i.e. to which lighting element it is attached.  The lighting effect of the control device could be, e.g., that the lighting element
situated above and the lighting element situated below the control device are to be lit whereas the lighting elements to the left and to the right are to be turned off.  The orientation of the control device may be determined using, e.g., an
accelerometer.
<br/><br/> The inventive control device may, e.g., incorporate at least one of a radio receiver, a television receiver, and a connection to the Internet.  The control device can be programmable via a keyboard, a radio connection, an infrared connection, a
smart card, a USB memory stick, a wi-fi connection, a Bluetooth connection, and a ZigBee connection.
<br/><br/> The plurality of lighting elements can be controlled by control devices to, e.g., display the number of people in a cafeteria, illustrate the status of a sleeping baby, the amount of online activity within a Hyves and/or <b><i>Facebook</i></b> community, or
could indicate how the weather is expected to develop in the coming hours.
<br/><br/> In the following, a description is given of a method of controlling a lighting element 1000 chosen from a plurality of lighting elements 2000, wherein the lighting element 1000 is connected to the other lighting elements of the plurality of
lighting elements 2000.  A control device is connected to the lighting element 1000, the control device comprising at least one switch for controlling a lighting effect of the lighting element 1000.  The at least one switch is operated.  The control
device, when it is connected to said lighting element 1000, is arranged to control said at least one lighting effect of said lighting element 1000.  The control device, when it is connected to said lighting element 1000, may control at least one adjacent
