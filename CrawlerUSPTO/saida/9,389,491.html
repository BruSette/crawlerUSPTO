       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A camera system is configured to detachably couple to a camera mount,
     which in turn can be attached to an apparatus. The camera mount is a
     spring clamp including two arms, each include a handle component and a
     jaw component. The spring clamp can be attached to an apparatus when the
     two jaw components are closed around the apparatus. A strap is adjustably
     coupled to the spring clamp and is tightened around the apparatus to
     further secure the apparatus. In some cases, a flexible neck is fastened
     to the camera mount, and the camera system is detachably coupled to the
     flexible neck. This allows a mounted camera system to be situated at any
     desired angle for taking photographs.

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> 1 .  Technical Field
<br/><br/> This disclosure relates to a camera system, and more specifically, to a spring clamp mount for a camera.
<br/><br/> 2 .  Description of the Related Art
<br/><br/> Digital cameras are increasingly used in outdoors and sports environments.  In order to allow for the safe use of cameras in such environments, the cameras need to be secured to camera mounts, which in turn can be secured to, for example, sports
equipment, vehicles, or a user.  One such means for securing a camera to a camera mount is a camera housing that securely encloses or partially encloses a camera, and couples to a camera mount.  A user experience with a camera mount can be diminished by
difficult or inefficient mechanisms for securing and releasing the camera mount to an apparatus.  In addition, the user experience can be further complicated if the camera mount does not allow for securing the camera housing at a desired angle for taking
photographs. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The figures and the following description relate to preferred embodiments by way of illustration only.  It should be noted that from the following discussion, alternative embodiments of the structures and methods disclosed herein will be readily
recognized as viable alternatives that may be employed without departing from the principles of what is claimed.
<br/><br/> Reference will now be made in detail to several embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying figures.  It is noted that wherever practicable similar or like reference numbers may be used in the figures and may indicate
similar or like functionality.  The figures depict embodiments of the disclosed system (or method) for purposes of illustration only.  One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following description that alternative embodiments of the
structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles described herein.
<br/><br/> Example Camera System Configuration
<br/><br/> A camera system includes a camera and a camera housing structured to at least partially enclose the camera.  The camera comprises a camera body having a camera lens structured on a front surface of the camera body, various indicators on the
front of the surface of the camera body (such as LEDs, displays, and the like), various input mechanisms (such as buttons, switches, and touch-screen mechanisms), and electronics (e.g., imaging electronics, power electronics, etc.) internal to the camera
body for capturing images via the camera lens and/or performing other functions.  The camera housing includes a lens window structured on the front surface of the camera housing and configured to substantially align with the camera lens, and one or more
indicator windows structured on the front surface of the camera housing and configured to substantially align with the camera indicators.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 1a and 1b illustrate various views of a camera system according to one example embodiment.  The camera system includes, among other components, a camera housing 100.  In one embodiment, a first housing portion 102 includes a front face
with four sides (i.e., a top side, bottom side, left side, and right side) structured to form a cavity that receives a camera (e.g. a still camera or video camera).  In other embodiments, the camera housing 100 may not include one or more sides or faces. For instance, the camera housing 100 may not include a front or back face, allowing the front face and rear face of the camera to be exposed when partially enclosed by the top side, bottom side, left side, and right side of the camera housing 100.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the camera housing 100 has a small form factor (e.g., a height of approximately 3 to 6 centimeters, a width of approximately 3 to 7 centimeters, and a depth of approximately 1 to 4 centimeters), and is lightweight (e.g.,
approximately 50 to 150 grams).  The camera housing 100 can be rigid (or substantially rigid) (e.g., plastic, metal, fiberglass, etc.) or pliable (or substantially pliable) (e.g., leather, vinyl, neoprene, etc.).  In one embodiment, the camera housing
100 may be appropriately configured for use in various elements.  For example, the camera housing 100 may comprise a waterproof enclosure that protects a camera from water when used, for example, while surfing or scuba diving.
<br/><br/> Portions of the camera housing 100 may include exposed areas to allow a user to manipulate buttons on the camera that are associated with the camera functionality.  Alternatively, such areas may be covered with a pliable material to allow the
user to manipulate the buttons through the camera housing 100.  For example, in one embodiment the top face of the camera housing 100 includes an outer shutter button 112 structured so that a shutter button 112 of the camera is substantially aligned with
the outer shutter button 112 when the camera is secured within the camera housing 100.  The shutter button 112 of the camera is operationally coupled to the outer shutter button 112 so that pressing the outer shutter button 112 allows the user to operate
the camera shutter button.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the front face of the camera housing 100 includes a lens window 104 structured so that a lens of the camera is substantially aligned with the lens windows 104 when the camera is secured within the camera housing 100.  The lens
window 104 can be adapted for use with a conventional lens, a wide angle lens, a flat lens, or any other specialized camera lens.  In this embodiment, the lens window 104 comprises a waterproof seal so as to maintain the waterproof aspect of the housing
100.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the camera housing 100 includes one or more securing structures 120 for securing the camera housing 100 to one of a variety of mounting devices.  For example, FIG. 1a illustrates the camera housing secured to a clip-style
mount 122.  In this example, the camera housing 100 includes a first plurality of protrusions (protrusions 124 as shown in FIG. 1b), and the mount 122 includes a second plurality of protrusions.  Each protrusion includes a hole (hole 126 as shown in FIG.
1b) at a similar location within the protrusion such that the first and second pluralities of protrusions can interlock in such a way that the protrusion holes substantially align.  Continuing with this example, a turnable handscrew is inserted through
the aligned holes, coupling the camera housing 100 to the mount 122 such that the camera housing can pivotally rotate relative to the mount when the turnable handscrew is in a first unlocked position, and such that the camera housing is fixed in position
relative to the mount when the turnable handscrew is in a second locked position.  In other embodiments, the camera housing 100 can be secured to a different type of mounting structure, and can be secured to a mounting structure via a different type of
coupling mechanism.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the camera housing 100 includes an indicator window 106 structured so that one or more camera indicators are substantially aligned with the indicator window 106 when the camera is secured within the camera housing 100.  The
indicator window 106 can be any shape or size, and can be made of the same material as the remainder of the camera housing 100, or can be made of any other material, for instance a transparent or translucent material and/or a non-reflective material.
<br/><br/> The described housing 100 may also be adapted for a wider range of devices of varying shapes, sizes and dimensions besides cameras.  For example, an expansion module may be attached to housing 100 to add expanded features to electronic devices
such as cell phones, music players, personal digital assistants ("PDAs"), global positioning system ("GPS") units, or other portable electronic devices.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1c is a rear perspective view of camera housing 100 illustrating a second housing portion 128, according to one example embodiment.  The second housing portion 128 detachably couples with the first housing portion 102 opposite the front
face of the first housing portion.  The first housing portion 102 and second housing portion 128 are collectively structured to enclose a camera within the cavity when the second housing portion 128 is secured to the first housing portion 102 in a closed
position.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the second housing portion 128 comprises a door 130 that allows the camera to be removed from the housing 100.  The door 130 pivots around a hinge 136 that allows the door 130 to be opened or shut.  In one embodiment, a first
fastening structure 138 located on the top face of the camera housing 100 detachably couples to a second fastening structure 140 on the door 130.  The fastening structures 138, 140 secure the door 130 to the first portion 102 of the camera housing 100 in
a closed position when coupled, as illustrated in FIG. 2.  In one embodiment, the fastening structure 138 comprises a hook-shaped lateral bar and the fastening structure 140 comprises an L-shaped bar.  The fastening structure 138 can pivot upwards to
allow the door 130 to close and can then be pressed down around the fastening structure 140 to hold the door 130 in the closed position.  In different embodiments, fastening structures for securing the door 130 can include, for example, a button
assembly, a buckle assembly, a clip assembly, a hook and loop assembly, a magnet assembly, a ball and catch assembly, and an adhesive assembly, or any other type of securing mechanism.
<br/><br/> In one alternative embodiment, the hinge 136 is instead located on the top face of the housing 100 and the fastening structures 138, 140 are instead located on the bottom face of the housing 100.  Alternatively, the hinge 136 and fastening
structures 138, 140 may be located on opposite side faces of the camera housing 100.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the housing 100 includes a watertight seal so that the housing 100 is waterproof when the door 130 is shut.  For example, in one embodiment, the door 130 includes a sealing structure positioned on interior edges of the door
130.  The sealing structure provides a watertight seal between the first portion of the camera housing 102 and the door 130 when the first securing structure 138 on the top face of the camera housing 100 is coupled to the second securing structure 140 on
the top edge of the door 130.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, an outer hinge structure 132 on the bottom edge of the second housing portion 128 detachably couples to an inner hinge structure 134 on the bottom edge of the first housing portion 102 to form the hinge 136.  For example, in
one embodiment, the outer hinge structure 132 comprises one or more hook-shaped protrusions structured to securely fasten to a rod-shaped member of the inner hinge structure 134.  Other mechanisms for coupling the second housing portion 128 to the
housing 100 may also be used in various alternative embodiments.  In other embodiments, the second housing portion 128 may be permanently attached to the first housing portion 102.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2a illustrates a camera 200 for use with the camera systems described herein, according to one example embodiment.  The camera 200 is configured to capture images and video, and to store captured images and video for subsequent display or
playback.  The camera 200 is adapted to fit within a camera housing, such as the housing 100 discussed above or any other housing described herein.  As illustrated, the camera 200 includes a lens 202 configured to receive light incident upon the lens and
to direct received light onto an image sensor internal to the lens.  The lens 202 is enclosed by a lens ring 204.
<br/><br/> The camera 200 can include various indicators, including the LED lights 206 and the LED display 208 shown in FIG. 2a.  When the camera 200 is enclosed within the housing 100, the LED display 208 is configured to substantially align with the
indicator window 106, and the LED lights 206 are configured to be visible through the housing 100.  The camera 200 can also include buttons 210 configured to allow a user of the camera to interact with the camera, to turn the camera on, and to otherwise
configure the operating mode of the camera.  The camera 200 can also include a microphone 212 configured to receive and record audio signals in conjunction with recording video.  The side of the camera 200 includes an I/O interface 214.  Though the
embodiment of FIG. 2a illustrates the I/O interface 214 enclosed by a protective door, the I/O interface can include any type or number of I/O ports or mechanisms, such as universal serial bus (USB) ports, HDMI ports, memory card slots, and the like.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2b illustrates a perspective view of a rear of a camera 200 for use with the camera system, according to one embodiment.  The camera 200 includes a door 216 that covers a removable battery and battery interface.  The door 216 can be removed
via the door release mechanism 218.  The camera also includes an expansion pack interface 220 configured to receive a removable expansion pack, such as a display module, an extra battery module, a wireless module, and the like.  Removable expansion
packs, when coupled to the camera 200, provide additional functionality to the camera via the expansion pack interface 220.
<br/><br/> Camera Mount with Clamp
<br/><br/> A camera mounting system is used to secure a camera system to an apparatus, such as sports equipment, music equipment, or a user.  To fasten the camera system to an apparatus, a camera housing 100 containing a camera is detachably secured to a
mount, and the mount is detachably secured to the apparatus.  FIG. 3 illustrates a spring clamp mount 300 for a camera housing 100, according to one embodiment.  The spring clamp mount 300 includes, among other components, a first arm composed of a first
handle 304 and a first jaw 306, and a second arm composed of a second handle 308 and a second jaw 310.  The first and second arms are pivotally coupled to each other at a spring joint by a pin or a screw 312.  It is noted that the first handle 304 and
the first jaw 306 and the second handle 308 and the second jaw 310 may have a unibody construction with functional operation divided between the handle and jaw as further disclosed herein.  In alternate embodiments the handle and jaw portions can be
individually constructed and coupled, e.g., via adhesive, weld or connecting structure such as rivet or screw and bolt.
<br/><br/> Operationally, when pressure is placed on the first 304 and second 308 handles, the first arm and second arms pivotally rotate around the screw 312 such that the first 306 and second 310 jaws are forcibly separated into an open position.  When
no pressure is placed on the first 304 and second 308 handles, the spring joint forcibly compresses the first 306 and second 310 jaws into a closed position.  It should be noted that the closed position can refer to either the compression of the jaws
together or the compression of the jaws around an apparatus and towards each other such that a space exists between the jaw ends.
<br/><br/> The spring clamp mount 300 is configured to be detachably secured to an apparatus when the first 306 and second 310 jaws are in the closed position around at least a portion of the apparatus.  For example, the spring clamp mount 300 may be
secured to an apparatus with a diameter of up to two inches.  In an embodiment, the first jaw 306 includes a first pivoting pad 314 and the second jaw 310 includes a second pivoting pad 316, so that when the first 306 and second 310 jaws are in the
closed position, the first 314 and second 316 pivoting pads are forcibly compressed together.  The pivoting pads 314/316 can be made of a compressible material (e.g., rubber, silicone, thick textile, etc.).  When the spring clamp mount 300 has been
secured to an apparatus, the first 314 and second 316 pivoting pads can be pivoted to an angle at which the pads have maximum possible contact with the apparatus.  This provides a buttressing effect to further secure the spring clamp mount 300 to the
apparatus by increasing the frictional forces between the spring clamp mount 300 and the apparatus.
<br/><br/> The spring clamp mount 300 also includes a strap 318 configured to provide an additional buttressing effect to secure the spring clamp mount 300 to an apparatus.  The strap 318 can be fixedly coupled to both the first jaw 306 and to the second
jaw 310, adjustably coupled to the first jaw 306 and fixedly coupled to the second jaw 310, or adjustably coupled to both the first jaw 306 and to the second jaw 310.  In one embodiment, the strap 318 is a ratcheted belt including multiple
unidirectionally angled parallel grooves 404.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates close-up views of a portion of the spring clamp mount depicting the strap 318 mechanism, according to one embodiment.  Here, the strap 318 is adjustably coupled to the first jaw 306 and fixedly coupled to the second jaw 310. 
The strap 318 is configured to wrap around a pin 406 that is coupled to the first jaw 310.  In an embodiment, the pin 406 is coupled to a bushing, reducing the force required to adjust the strap around the pin.  Below the pin 406 is an elevated ridge 408
coupled to the first pivoting pad 314 of the first jaw 306.  The strap 318 can be threaded between the pin 406 and the elevated ridge 408 and back around the first jaw 306 through a loop 410 in the first jaw 306.  When the first 306 and second 310 jaws
are in the closed position, the size of the gap between the elevated ridge 408 and the pin 406 is decreased and the elevated ridge 408 can be inserted into one of the grooves 404 of the strap 318, fixing the strap 318 into place.
<br/><br/> The grooves 404 of the strap are angled such that while the spring clamp mount is in the closed position, the strap 318 can be pulled outwards and away from the spring clamp mount 300.  At the same time, the strap 318 cannot slip backwards and
into the spring clamp mount unless the spring clamp mount is placed into the open position, increasing the size of the gap between the elevated ridge 408 and the pin 406 and allowing the strap to move freely relative to the pin 406.  Thus, if the spring
clamp mount 300 has been secured to an apparatus, a user may pull on the strap 318 to tighten it around the apparatus to provide an additional buttressing effect.  However, the strap 318 cannot loosen its hold on the apparatus until the first 306 and
second 310 jaws move into the open position and release the strap.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the strap 318 is not a ratcheted belt, but instead is an elastic belt containing multiple holes.  A prong coupled to the first jaw 306 is configured to be inserted through one of the holes in the belt.  When the first 306 and
second 310 jaws are in the closed position around an apparatus, a user can tighten the belt around an apparatus and insert the prong through a hole in the belt, further securing the spring clamp mount 300 to the apparatus.  In other embodiments, the
strap 318 comprises a hook and loop system, a button system, a clip system, a magnet system, a ball and catch system, an adhesive system, or any other type of securing mechanism that is used to secure the spring clamp mount 300 to an apparatus.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a buckle component on the camera housing 100 may be detachably secured to a buckle component on the spring clamp mount 300 to fasten the camera housing 100 to the spring clamp mount 300.  In a further embodiment, the camera
housing 100 has a female buckle component while the spring clamp mount 300 has a male buckle component.  In another embodiment, the camera housing 100 has a male buckle component while the spring clamp mount 300 has a female buckle component.  In yet
another embodiment, the camera housing 100 is secured to a clip-style mount 122 as described earlier, and the spring clamp mount 300 is configured to receive the clip-style mount 122.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the camera housing is not directly attached to the spring clamp mount 300.  FIG. 5 illustrates a flexible neck 502 coupled to the spring clamp mount 300.  A camera housing can detachably couple to the flexible neck 502.  The
flexible neck 502 is forcibly configured to twist or bend, securing the flexible neck 502 into a desired position, and allowing a camera to capture photographs from any desired angle while coupled to the flexible neck 502.  In one embodiment, the
flexible neck 502 is a modular hose composed of multiple modular links.  For example, the modular hose can be a Loc-Line.RTM.  (from Lockwood Products, Lake Oswego, Oreg.) hose composed of multiple Loc-Line.RTM.  links.  In a further embodiment, the
flexible neck 502 includes at least six Loc-Line.RTM.  links, allowing the flexible neck 502 to bend 90 degrees or more.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the flexible neck 502 is permanently attached to the spring clamp mount 300.  In other embodiments, the flexible neck 502 includes a buckle component 504 that may detachably couple the flexible neck 502 to the spring clamp
mount 300.  For example, the flexible neck 502 can have a female buckle component 504 while the mount 300 has a male buckle component 508.  In another embodiment, the flexible neck 502 has a male buckle component 504 while the mount 300 has a female
buckle component 508.
<br/><br/> The flexible neck 502 includes a second buckle component 506 that detachably couples the flexible neck 502 to a camera housing 100.  In one embodiment, the flexible neck 502 has a female buckle component 506 while the camera housing 100 has a
male buckle component.  In another embodiment, the flexible neck 502 has a male buckle component 506 while the camera housing has a female buckle component.  In addition, the camera housing 100 can be secured to a clip-style mount 122 as described
earlier, and the flexible neck 502 can be configured to receive the clip-style mount 122.  In further embodiments, the buckle component 506 of the flexible neck 502 couple to a second flexible neck 502, thus creating an extra-long flexible neck.  A
camera housing 100 may then be detachably coupled to the free end of the second flexible neck 502.
<br/><br/> In an example use scenario, a user attaches a flexible neck 502 to a spring clamp mount 300, and attaches a camera housing 100 enclosing a camera to the flexible neck 502.  The user then exerts pressure on the first 304 and second 308 handles of
the spring clamp mount, forcing the first 306 and second 310 jaws into the open position.  Next, the user places the jaws (306/310) around a pole and releases the pressure from the first 304 and second 308 handles, moving the first 306 and second 310
jaws into the closed position to secure the spring clamp mount 300 to the pole.  The first 314 and second 316 pivoting pads are pivoted at an angle at which the pads have formed a v-block around the pole.  The user pulls on the strap 318, tightening the
strap's 318 hold on the pole.  Finally, the user bends the flexible neck 502 to a desired angle for the mounted camera to take photographs.
<br/><br/> Additional Configuration Considerations
