FIELD
<br/><br/> The present invention relates generally to generating images based on biorhythms.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Currently users of smartphones take pictures on demand based on the actions of the user or after a short delay specified by the user.  Said pictures are then transmitted via such means as e-mail, texting, Internet relay chat [IRC], instant
messages [IMs], via <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> via blog posts, via Twitter, via Pinterest, or by another means to others on social networks.  In a conventional social network, a typical user of a smartphone communicates with other such users by providing pictures and
video generated by the user on the smartphone.  Such pictures and video are then posted to social network websites in a manner that is accessible to other users of said social media websites.  For example, a user of a social networking website might post
pictures and video taken by said user, showing daily live and special events such as the Super Bowl or a musical concert.  The user may also post pictures and videos from their smartphone showing recent acquisitions such as the purchase of a new
automobile or TV set.  Other users, who have access to the user's posted information, may contact the user to comment or review information about common shared interests or for other reasons.
<br/><br/> There is a trend for social networking websites to focus on images as proven by the success of Pinterest.com and many other such websites.  There is a need for a way to generate many images from each 24-hour period with minimal user interaction
with their smartphone.
<br/><br/> A variety of systems and methods may be implemented according to the present invention, and they may operate in a variety of environments.  Some embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for communicating images taken by a
user's smartphone with the triggering event, i.e., the event that causes the camera in the smartphone to activate, being based on biorhythms instead of active control of the camera by the user.  A means to capture moments digitally with minimal user
interaction with their smartphone based on biological processes such as increased heart rate, respiration rate, or another means is missing in the current art.
<br/><br/> A social network environment provides the opportunity for frequent, automatic notification of changes in the information posted by other users.  In one embodiment of the current invention, such automatic notification enables the user and those
the user has selected to see images triggered by biorhythms on a specific day at a specific time.
<br/><br/> A social network environment provides the opportunity to accumulate extensive historical data about users' transmissions of images and videos.  In one embodiment of the current invention, predictive analytics operations on such historical data
from a variety of web-accessible databases enables forecasting of appropriate selections of images and/or videos from a pre-determined array of images and/or videos taken during a particular event or occasion.
<br/><br/> Social networks, such as <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Google+, LinkedIn, Yahoo Groups, and Twitter, have rapidly deployed around the world engaging hundreds of millions of users and providing an opportunity for global reach within authenticated social networks. 
In one embodiment of the present invention, image and video distribution is facilitated by storage of images and videos for later transmission to social networks.
<br/><br/> Social network providers such as <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Google+, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Yahoo Groups, and Social API have platforms that the present invention can utilize.  They provide profiles and interest or affinity information about users, a means of
forming authenticated communities, and a wealth of historical data on which the communication and analytics engines of the present invention can operate.  However, there are many critical features of the present invention that fall outside their scope,
e.g., triggering the capturing of images and videos based on biorhythms.
<br/><br/> The purpose of this introduction is to give the reader an overview of the general subject matter of the invention.  By no means is the invention limited to such subject matter or by the illustrative embodiments of the invention.  These
embodiment are mentioned not to limit or define the invention, but to provide examples of some embodiments of the invention to aid in the understanding thereof.  Illustrative embodiments are discussed in the Detailed Description, and further description
of the invention is provided there.  Advantages offered by the various embodiments of the present invention may be further understood by examining this specification.
<br/><br/> Some or all of the above needs may be addressed by certain embodiments of the invention.  Certain embodiments of the invention may include systems and methods for retaining valuable images until an appropriate event occurs, for instance,
retaining an outdoor scene until the intended recipient moves into an appropriate living space that will accommodate a large reproduction of the image.  The present invention overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches by providing a full range
or images and storage until the most appropriate time.  Aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.
<br/><br/> Variations and modifications can be made to these exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.  Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention.  Such other
embodiments and aspects can be understood with reference to the following detailed description, accompanying drawings, and claims.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> A method and system for capturing images and videos with minimal user interaction with their smartphone triggered by the user's biorhythms, such as their heart rate, is described.  A user, wearing apparatus containing a smartphone and
biosensors, goes about their normal daily life and the system captures at specific points, say when the user's heart rate is in a specific range, images and videos for instantaneous transmission to the Internet and social networks or for storage and
future transmission to said social networks.  Audio files could be captured and transcribed into other media such as documents.  These and other aspects, features, implementations, and advantages, and combinations of them, can be expressed as methods,
apparatus, systems, components, program products, business methods, and means or steps for performing functions, or combinations of these.
<br/><br/> Other features, aspects, implementations, and advantages will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and other specifications of the invention. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES
<br/><br/> A full and enabling disclosure of the present invention, including the best mode thereof, directed to one of ordinary skill in the art, is set forth in the specification, which makes reference to the appended figures, which are not necessarily
drawn to scale, and wherein:
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary schematic diagram of an apparatus
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary arrangement of an apparatus on a user's body
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is an exemplary flowchart of a functional application
<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
<br/><br/> In a social network, such as an extended family, communications of images, audio files, and videos often take place for holidays, at anniversaries, such as birthdays, special occasions, such as bar mitzvahs or first communions, or on the
occasion of milestone events, such as high school or college graduation, the birth of a child, or a promotion or attainment of an achievement award.  The present invention facilitates such communications at a pre-selected time even when the user of the
apparatus and system is asleep.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary environment, 200, showing the biorhythm detector.  In FIG. 1, the pulse sensor for detecting the user's heart beats per minute, 202, is connected to a processor which contains software code that tracks heart beats
per minute, 204, by a wired signal or by a wireless signal or by Bluetooth wireless connection technology or by near field communication, NFC, which is labeled 210.  Said processor is connected to a wearable camera, 206, by a wired signal or by a
wireless signal or by Bluetooth wireless connection technology or by NFC, labeled 208.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary arrangement, 400, of the apparatus of FIG. 1 on a user's body.  In FIG. 2, the user of said apparatus, 402, is wearing a camera for taking photographs or videos, 404.  Also shown, 406, is a wristband that houses
the processor and pulse sensor of FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is an exemplary flowchart of a functional application.  In FIG. 3, the user puts on the apparatus, 600, of FIG. 1 and switches said apparatus on, 602, and the user sets the biorhythm threshold at which pictures and/or video will be
recorded, 604, then, 606, the user proceeds about their normal routine.  At this point if the user is done with their normal routine for the day the user turns the device off, 616.  Then the user removes the device, 618.  If the biorhythm signal exceeds
the pre-selected threshold, 610, while the device is turned on, the camera takes a photo or a video is captured, 612, and then the photo or video is stored or transmitted to a pre-selected person in a social network or a group of such person.
<br/><br/> As desired, embodiments of the invention may include the biosensors with more or fewer of the components illustrated.
<br/><br/> The invention is described above with reference to block and flow diagrams of systems, methods, apparatuses, and/or computer program products according to exemplary embodiments of the invention.  In one embodiment of the invention users may
access the social network by desktop or laptop computers.  In another embodiment users may access the social network by mobile smart phones.  In another embodiment of the invention users may access the social network by tablet computers or any commercial
computing device connected to the Internet.  In one embodiment of the invention the transmission and storage of captured images, audio files, and videos may be constructed to operate on the Internet independent of existing social networks using
technology known to anyone skilled in the art.  In another embodiment of the invention the transmission of captured media may operate using existing social networks, e.g., <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> as platforms using existing application interfaces open to website
developers skilled in the art.  It will be understood that one or more blocks of the block diagrams and flow diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and flow diagrams, respectively, can be implemented by computer-executable program
instructions.  Likewise, some blocks of the block diagrams and flow diagrams may not necessarily need to be performed in the order presented, or may not necessarily need to be performed at all, according to some embodiments of the invention.
<br/><br/> These computer-executable program instructions may be loaded onto a general-purpose computer, a special-purpose computer, a processor, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a particular machine, such that the instructions
that execute on the computer, processor, or other programmable data processing apparatus create means for implementing one or more functions specified in the flow diagram block or blocks.  These computer program instructions may also be stored in a
computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including
instruction means that implement one or more functions specified in the flow diagram block or blocks.  As an example, embodiments of the invention may provide for a computer program product, comprising a computer-usable medium having a computer-readable
program code or program instructions embodied therein, said computer-readable program code adapted to be executed to implement one or more functions specified in the flow diagram block or blocks.  The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto
a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational elements or steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer-implemented process such that the instructions that
execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide elements or steps for implementing the functions specified in the flow diagram block or blocks.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, blocks of the block diagrams and flow diagrams support combinations of means for performing the specified functions, combinations of elements or steps for performing the specified functions and program instruction means for
performing the specified functions.  It will also be understood that each block of the block diagrams and flow diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and flow diagrams, can be implemented by special-purpose, hardware-based computer
systems that perform the specified functions, elements or steps, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.
