<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a system 100 for providing a means for correlating real life events with a digital life associated with social media outlets, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.  Social networking media outlets or
websites may be used to convey real-life events such as, inter alia, births, deaths, etc. System 100 provides a mechanism for: 1.  Automatically correlating real life events from sources such as, inter alia, obituaries newspapers, online services, law
enforcement agencies, etc. 2.  Deduce online personas for name(s) retrieved from the sources based on geographical and profile information.  3.  Qualify and refine the online personas based on text mining posts in social networking groups/circles.  4. 
Deducing life events (based on information derived in steps 1-3) and enabling an appropriate action to freeze or suspend an account transmitting a notification of a person and/or family for confirmation.  5.  Marking an online persona/account as inactive
and eliminating the account from repetitive reminders to reconnect.
<br/><br/> System 2 of FIG. 1 includes a correlation engine 17 (i.e., within a computing system) connected through a network to a social media feed/system 20 and a news feed/system 25.  The network 7 may include any type of network including, inter alia, a
local area network, (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, a wireless network, etc. The computing system may include any type of computing system(s) including, inter alia, a computer (PC), a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a server, a PDA, a
smart phone, etc.
<br/><br/> Correlation engine 17 enables the following process with respect to determining a death has occurred:
<br/><br/> When events are presented in news articles, obituaries, or social media posts (e.g., presented via social media feed/system 20 and news feed/system 25), correlation engine 17 determines the events to be events (associated with a death) by the
use of key words in specified grammatical presentations (e.g., died, deceased, etc.).  If correlation engine 17 determines that there is a potential death of an individual who is named in one or more of posts of a social networking system, correlation
engine 17 will attempt to determine a real identity and a digital identity of the individual by comparing known information between multiple posts and systems (e.g., a name, city, age, survived by, friends, workplace, email address, last known login,
etc.).  If the digital identity an individual (e.g., John Doe) with respect to multiple events correlate then correlation engine 17 may accurately determine that the real person (John Doe) with a digital ID of JohnDoe@email.address.com has actually
passed away.  For example: 1.  John Doe is named in an obituary stating that he is survived his wife Jane Doe and 2 named children).  2.  A social network ID with the name John Doe is discovered.  The social network ID John Doe is listed as being married
to Jane Doe, has posted pictures with matching names of the 2 named children, and has multiple friends of John Doe posting RIP messages about John Doe.
<br/><br/> Additionally, a certainty percentage may be calculated based on a number of correlating posts and the detail of information describing the situation.  In response, correlation engine 17 may determine which social media systems that the social
network ID correlates to and may inform the social media system that the individual has passed away.  The various social media systems may then take any appropriate actions, including a temporary suspension of a social networking account followed by
disabling of the account once family members are contacted to confirm the death and requested action.
<br/><br/> The following steps describe an implementation example enabling a means for correlating real life events with a digital life associated with social media outlets, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.  1.  An (real life) event
(associated with an individual) occurs (e.g., a birth or death).  2.  Users (of social media) post information regarding the event on social media networks.  3.  The social media networks perform text analytics to determine that the event has occurred. 
For example, as more people post (on the social media networks), entity analytics may be used to determine people involved with the posts and relationships to the event/involved individual.  4.  The social media networks co-relate data (associated with
the event) from trusted sources.  Trusted sources may include: A. Media outlets associated with a real name requirement.  B. A source comprising attributes associated with the individual and associated social network.  The attributes are utilized to
identify the individual.  For example, attributes such as location (based on location data of a device used to make an update, an EXIF data in an uploaded image(s), etc. B. A source generating entity analytics used to continuously monitor different
name(s) used by individuals within the social network.  Once a location is determined and a name(s) of the individual is identified, an event feed from the trusted sources of locale is scanned to corroborate the event.  5.  A catalogue of additional
trusted sources (e.g., newspaper records, data from law enforcement agencies, life incident data, etc.) is built over time.  6.  All data from trusted sources is used to build a profile of the individual including attributes such as location, name,
location of the incident, etc. 7.  Text analytics associated with comments/data posted on social media networks are used with entity analytics performed over time and correlated with data from the public sources to uniquely identify an individual(s) that
may have passed away.  8.  The social media networks enter a process to obtain confirmation from people that are closest to the individual.  For example, top N (closest or most interacted with) connections are asked to confirm.  Upon confirmation, the
social media account of the individual is disabled thereby excluding the social media account from all updates, reminders, etc. 9.  Well established social media outlets may optionally process every single account in their database and correlate it with
data from the trusted sources to determine people who may no longer be alive.  10.  In cases of new births, people generally post pictures or other status updates that may be picked up by text analytics.  In response, a separate process flow is enabled
to validate (i.e., for individuals that have been tagged or deduced via analytics) for confirmation.  A social media outlet may optionally initiate a new process to label a new birth (e.g., as a new timeline or account cataloguing the activities of the
new born).
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates a screen shot 200 describing an implementation example for correlating real life events with a digital life associated with social media outlets, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.  The implementation
example illustrates that Betty Smith and Bobby K (i.e., connections of John Smith who is deceased) have posted (on a social network) about his passing.  A text analytics (or text mining) process is performed with respect to data that extracts tags such
as "Goodbye" and "is no more" to determine that (according to people within John Smith's network) that he has passed.  Additional information gathered by the social media network (such as, inter alia, a location and date of birth) comprises related
informational data regarding John Smith.  Additionally, the social media network may federate the informational data with public data sources (to verify a name, date of birth, and location) and law enforcement lists or obituaries issued by local
newspapers.  If the data sources confirm that John Smith has passed away, then correlation engine 17 transmits a message to social media contacts of John Smith.  The message may link to a web page where: 1.  The contacts are asked to confirm that John
Smith has passed away.  2.  The contacts are provided an option to choose if John Smith's social network Webpage will remain enabled.  For example, the contacts may select disabling all updates to John Smith's social network Webpage.  Alternatively, the
contacts may select an option for continuing to allow people to post messages (to John Smith's social network Webpage) for a specified time period.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an algorithm detailing a process flow enabled by system 100 of FIG. 1 for providing a means for correlating real life events with a digital life associated with social media outlets, in accordance with embodiments of the
present invention.  In step 300, social network data associated with users of at least one social network (e.g., social network Website) is retrieved.  In step 302, the social network data is analyzed.  In step 304, results of the analysis of step 302
are associated with event data associated with a user of the users.  The event data may be generated by performing a text analytics process with respect to the social network data.  Alternatively or additionally, the event data may be generated
performing a video analytics process with respect to the social network data.  In step 308, temporary actions associated with a social network account of user are enabled.  The temporary actions may include temporarily suspending or disabling the social
network account of the user.  In step 310, a notification indicating the temporary actions and associated reasons for enabling the temporary actions are transmitted to a group of users associated with the social network account of the user.  In step 312,
confirmation data associated with enabling the temporary actions is received from the group of users in response to the notification of step 310.  In step 314, permanent actions associated with the temporary actions are enabled based on the confirmation
data.  Enabling the permanent actions may include (if the analyzing and confirmation data indicate that the user is no longer available (e.g., has passed away) for access to the social network account): 1.  Disabling the social network account and
disabling updates/posts associated with the social network account.  2.  Maintaining the social network account and disabling updates/posts associated with the social network account.  3.  Maintaining the social network account and enabling (for a
specified time period) updates/posts associated with the social network account.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates an algorithm detailing a process flow enabled by system 100 of FIG. 1 for reinstating a permanently disabled social networking account of a user due to a mistake, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.  In
step 400, an email confirmation is received (from the user) indicating that the user is available (e.g., has not passed away) for access to the social network account.  The email confirmation is received from a registered email address associated with
the social network account.  In step 402, a request for video evidence indicating that the user is available for access to the social network account is transmitted to the user.  In step 404, a video device (e.g., a Web camera of a device belonging to
the user) is enabled in response to a user action with respect to the request.  In step 408, a current photo of the user is retrieved from the video device.  In step 410, additional photos of the user are retrieved from the social network account.  In
step 412, the current photo is compared to the additional photos.  In step 414, a match between the current photo and the additional photos is determined.  In step 418, the social network account and associated updates are enabled.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates an algorithm detailing a process flow describing an implementation example enabled by system 100 of FIG. 1 for providing a means for correlating real life events with a digital life associated with social media outlets, in
accordance with embodiments of the present invention.  Each of the steps in the algorithm of FIG. 2 may be enabled and executed in any order by a computer processor executing computer code.  In step 500, an (real life) event (associated with an
individual) occurs (e.g., a birth, a death, etc.).  In step 502, users post information regarding the event on social media networks.  In step 504, the event is compared to digital events retrieved from a variety of sources.  For example: 1.  Digital
events may comprise life incident data 504a retrieved from newspapers.  2.  Digital events may comprise life incident data 504b retrieved from law enforcement agencies.  3.  Digital events may comprise text analysis data 504c generated by the social
media networks performing text/video analytics to determine that the event has occurred.  4.  Digital events may comprise relationship analysis data 504d generated by the social media networks analyzing social media relationships to determine that the
event has occurred.  For example, as more people post (on the social media networks), entity analytics may be used to determine people involved with the posts and relationships to the event/involved individual.
<br/><br/> In step 508, a social network account of the individual is temporally marked as inactive due to the event.  In step 510, friends and family (of the individual) are notified that the social network account of the individual is temporally marked
as inactive.  The friends and family are asked to confirm/verify the event.  In step 512, the network account of the individual is permanently disabled in response to confirmation of the event.  In step 514, updates (from friends) are disabled from the
network account of the individual and the process is terminated in step 518.
