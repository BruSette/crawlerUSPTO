       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A social media platform is provided for interacting in a
     three-dimensional platform. The platform leverages a social graph from a
     user's social network to enable the user to invite social networking
     friends to interact within a three-dimensional virtual social venue. The
     platform also enables users to select multiple videos to display
     simultaneously within the virtual social venue. User selection of a
     clickable advertisement within the virtual social venue causes a web
     browser to launch with a point-of-sale opportunity related to the
     advertisement.

<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>We claim: <br/><br/> 1.  A method for sharing multiple video streams with others within a virtual social venue, the method comprising: providing a user with an interface comprising a virtual
three-dimensional space;  connecting to one or more social networks to which the user belongs, accessing a social graph associated with the user, the social graph being provided by a social network to which the user belongs, the social graph including a
list of friends of the user;  leveraging the social graph to enable the user to selectively invite friends from the user's social network to participate in the virtual social venue;  providing a plurality of virtual screens, windows, or other viewing
surfaces within the virtual three-dimensional space;  enabling the user and/or the user's friends to select multiple video streams to feed into the virtual three-dimensional space;  instantiating the multiple selected video streams onto the plurality of
virtual screens, windows, or other viewing surfaces;  and simultaneously displaying the multiple selected video streams on the plurality of virtual screens, windows, or other viewing surfaces to the users within the context of the virtual
three-dimensional space.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of virtual screens, windows, or other viewing surfaces include different angularly oriented screens, billboards, windows, or other viewing surfaces.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 2, wherein the virtual three-dimensional space is a virtual three-dimensional representation of a stadium, coliseum, arena, stage, theater, or other large physical structure providing a seating area for clustering an
audience of people in proximity to each other.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 3, further comprising: providing three-dimensional animated avatars to represent the users;  and displaying the multiple selected video streams to the users while simultaneously displaying the avatars of neighboring users
within the context of the virtual three-dimensional space.
<br/><br/> 5.  The computer-implemented method of claim 4, further comprising populating the virtual three-dimensional space with artificial-intelligence avatars that do not represent invited users.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 4, further comprising: enabling the users to communicate with each other;  and displaying visual overlays within the virtual three-dimensional space to represent communications between the users.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 4, further comprising: providing each avatar with a position and orientation within the virtual three-dimensional space;  and displaying the selected video streams to each user with a yaw and pitch consistent with
relative differences between the user's position and orientation and a position and orientation of the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 4, further comprising: enabling each avatar to navigate to a user-selected position and orientation within the virtual three-dimensional space;  and updating the display of the virtual three-dimensional space to the user
to provide the user with a field of view consistent with the selected position and orientation of the avatar within the virtual three-dimensional space;  wherein if any portion of the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface is still within the
field of view of the user, then that portion of the instantiated media content continues to be displayed to the user.
<br/><br/> 9.  The method of claim 1, further comprising enabling users to zoom into video feeds that they select.
<br/><br/> 10.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: providing one or more additional viewing surfaces within the virtual three-dimensional space;  instantiating clickable advertisements on the one or more additional viewing surfaces;  and if one of
the clickable advertisements is selected, launching a web browser window with a point-of-sale web page outside the interface, without pausing the experience within the user interface.
<br/><br/> 11.  A method for leveraging a social network to create virtual social media experiences within a virtual three-dimensional space, the method comprising: providing a user with an interface that provides a shareable virtual three-dimensional
space and enables the user to invite friends from a social network to which he or she belongs;  enabling the user to select two-dimensional media content to share within that space;  connecting to the user's social network, wherein the social network
provides a social graph with a list of friends of the user;  leveraging the social graph to enable the user to invite friends from the social network to share the two-dimensional media within the shareable virtual three-dimensional space;  providing a
virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface within the virtual three-dimensional space;  instantiating the selected media content onto the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface;  and displaying the selected media content to a user within
the context of the virtual three-dimensional space;  within the virtual social venue, providing one or more displays containing one or more advertisements for one or more products or services related to the selected media content, the one or more
advertisements being selectable by the user;  upon selection by a user of an advertisement, opening a browser window to a point-of-sale webpage where the user can purchase a corresponding product or service.
<br/><br/> 12.  The method of claim 11, wherein the method further comprises: after the step of opening a browser window, completing a purchase of the one or more products.
<br/><br/> 13.  The method of claim 12, wherein the step of opening a browser window comprises launching a browser window external to the enclosed virtual social venue, enabling a purchase transaction to be performed without pausing the experience within
the social venue.
<br/><br/> 14.  The method of claim 11, wherein the virtual three-dimensional space is a virtual three-dimensional representation of a stadium, coliseum, arena, stage, theater, or other large physical structure providing a seating area for clustering an
audience of people in proximity to each other.
<br/><br/> 15.  The method of claim 14, further comprising: providing three-dimensional animated avatars to represent the users;  and displaying the multiple selected video streams to the users while simultaneously displaying the avatars of neighboring
users within the context of the virtual three-dimensional space.

<br/><br/> The present invention relates to a platform for providing social networking services within a virtual venue to allow for interaction between users with third-party media content, and more specifically to a method for instantiating facial images
onto 3D avatars within the virtual venue.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> People utilize computers to access or generate information, to produce content, to communicate with others, to experience media (music, television, movies, or other video), and to play games.  However, most computer experiences are not shared by
multiple users, because they are isolated from each other in terms of geography, chronology, or with respect to the content that they accessed.  Whatever activity that a computer user experiences is typically either asynchronous to other users (such as
email, viewing and posting within a social network service, etc.), or synchronous within a closed environment (such as online gaming).  Alternatively, the activity is entirely personal, such as viewing a movie, watching a sporting event via a web feed,
or laughing at the latest YouTube.TM.  post.
<br/><br/> The last few years have witnessed the rise of online social networks to connect people with friends, acquaintances, and enable them to share interests, pictures, videos, emails, and the like.  A typical online social network provides a
representation of each user (often a profile), his/her social links, and a variety of services, including means for users to interact over the internet, such as e-mail and instant messaging.  Social networking sites allow users to share ideas,
activities, events, and interests within their individual networks.
<br/><br/> However, such social networking sites are typically asynchronous.  That is, users access network services on their schedule, and review activities, events and interests that have been previously posted by other users within their network.  And,
if they add content or dialogue to their network, other users will see such posting at a later time, when they access the network.
<br/><br/> By contrast, online gaming services connect people in a synchronous fashion.  That is, gamers go online and share a gaming experience with each other at the same time.  However, the form of the shared content is predefined: the game that the
users are playing.  The online games are closed systems, where the content that is experienced by the users is predefined within the gaming environment.  Moreover, the persons with whom the content is shared is also closed and restricted to members
involved in the game.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> A system is provided for sharing multiple video streams with others within a virtual social venue.  The system provides an interface comprising a virtual three-dimensional space, and enables users to select multiple video streams to feed into
the virtual three-dimensional space.  The system also connects to one or more social networks to which the users belong and accesses social graphs, associated with the users, which are provided by the user's social network(s).  Each social graph includes
a list of friends of each corresponding user.  The system leverages the social graph to enable the particular user to invite friends from the corresponding social network to participate within the virtual social venue.  The system also provides a
plurality of virtual screens, windows, or other viewing surfaces within the virtual three-dimensional space, instantiates the multiple selected video streams onto the plurality of virtual screens, windows, or other viewing surfaces, and simultaneously
displays them.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the system provides one or more displays, in addition to those showing the selected video streams, containing clickable advertisements for one or more products or services related to the selected media content.  The
advertisements are selectable by the user.  Selection by a user of an advertisement launches a browser window to a website containing a point of sale opportunity.
<br/><br/> These and other features and embodiments of the invention will be apparent in connection with the attached drawings and detailed disclosure that follows. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention is directed at taking all of the experiences that are possible for a user on his/her computer, whether browsing content, enjoying video, gaming, or obtaining information, and placing such experiences on a platform that
integrates the experiences within the context of a social network.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a screenshot of one embodiment of a virtual social venue 100 for instantiating extrinsically-sourced media content.  The virtual social venue 100 comprises a virtual three-dimensional space--in the illustrated case--a large stadium,
for hosting a large gathering of people.  The virtual social venue 100 provides a plurality of virtual screens, windows, or other viewing surfaces within the virtual three-dimensional space on which to instantiate various streams of extrinsically-sourced
media content.  FIG. 1 illustrates a plurality of elevated billboards 101 installed between seating levels of the stadium and large floor-level jumbotron video display 102 wrapping around a field or stage.  The billboards 101 and video display 102 are
displaying various streams of instantiated media content.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates the virtual social venue 100 populated with representations of users admitted from one or more social networks, as well as representations of artificial intelligence (AI) controlled characters.  In FIG. 2, the representations
are in the form of three-dimensional animated avatars.  Representations may alternatively take any form preferred by the user.  In some embodiments, seats or standing locations in the virtual social venue 100 are automatically and intelligently assigned
to cluster users together as they enter the venue.  In other embodiments, a moderator or host assigns seats or standing locations to invited users.  In yet other embodiments, seats or standing locations are sold or auctioned based upon the relative
desirability of the seats.  In yet further embodiments, users have the ability and privilege to navigate through the virtual social venue 100 and migrate to unoccupied seats or standing locations that the users select.  A user can change seats by double
clicking on an empty seat, hitting keys to migrate over to an empty seat, or requesting to sit near someone.  In the preferred embodiments, multiple avatars cannot occupy the same seat, but a single avatar (particularly an advertising avatar) may be able
to occupy multiple locations simultaneously.
<br/><br/> The virtual social venue 100 enables users to express emotional and/or social responses to the media content they are experiencing, as well as to the activities going on in their virtual environment.  The virtual social venue 100 also enables
users to interact with the other avatars and participants.  Examples of emotional responses and social interactions include but are not limited to standing, waving, booing, cheering, and clapping.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 depicts avatars reacting as a mob and individually.  For example, in the illustrated embodiment, all three avatars 103, 104 and 105 are standing on their feet and reacting to some event as a mob.  However, avatar 105 is reacting
differently than avatars 103 and 104 at the moment the screen shot was taken.  These avatars also perform actions responsive to the participants' controls or other actions or events occurring within the virtual social venue 100.  FIG. 3 depicts an
example of a mob of avatars 110 reacting to the participant's avatar 111.  In addition, participants may enter and control various AI avatars with which they come into contact.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 2-3 illustrate social interactions taking place within a virtual social venue embodied as a virtual structure, and more particularly, as a stadium, coliseum or arena.  Other embodiments of virtual social venues include theaters, stages,
conference buildings, and other gathering places.  In at least one embodiment, participants with social connectivity can engage in collaborative social activities within the virtual social venue.  For example, participants can decide to watch a
particular video feed on a display screen in the virtual coliseum within the virtual social venue.  The video feed may be a movie, TV series, or any other video content.
<br/><br/> Based upon his or her seating or standing location within the three-dimensional virtual social venue 100, each user has a unique position and orientation--and corresponding perspective and field of view--within the virtual three-dimensional
space.  When media content is instantiated onto a viewing surface 101 or 102 within the three-dimensional space, it is scaled, rotated to a yaw and pitch, and depth-transformed consistent with the relative differences between the user's position and
orientation and the viewing surface's position and orientation.  This three-dimensional transformation is unique to each user, so it is preferably managed by each user's own client-side hardware resources.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 depicts an example of a video screen 121 within the virtual social venue 100 that has been scaled, rotated and depth-transformed to match a user's perspective.  The same video or other media is also streamed to other participants to
watch, but scaled, rotated and depth-transformed to match those participant's unique perspectives.
<br/><br/> Each participant's view can be adjusted to zoom in and out of the video screen 121 so that each participant can watch a full-screen version of the video feed with other participants if desired.  FIG. 5 depicts zooming into a nearly full-screen
version of the video screen 121.  Further zooming would transform the video screen 121 into a non-rotated (fully orthogonal) full-screen view of the media content.  Also, once the participant zooms into the screen, additional content may be displayed,
such as content 511.  Each participant can also zoom back out from a full-screen view, enabling the participant to select the relative amount of attention to distribute between the media content and the social environment.
<br/><br/> Each participant can also enlarge their default field of view by zooming out far enough to see their own avatar and the surrounding environment.  By zooming out this way, the participant can gain a bird's-eye view of the virtual social venue,
and identify (and migrate to) areas that appear to be more lively and active than others.
<br/><br/> To enhance the social experience, audio content streamed into the virtual social venue is mixed with ambient audio expressions (such as shouting, booing, clapping, or real voice expressions) from the participants.  The audio content streamed
into the virtual world may also be mixed with attenuated sounds from other media content being instantiated on nearby viewing surfaces.  The audio is also preferably streamed to each participant in a 3-D, surround-sound format, with ambient sounds from
surrounding sources being attenuated and delayed as a function of the distance between the user's avatar and the source of the sound.  In one embodiment, zooming into a full-screen version of the video screen 121 has the concomitant effect of attenuating
ambient sounds (until the ambient sounds are turned off) and making the media content relatively louder.  Zooming out has the opposite effect, increasing the relative loudness of the ambient sounds.  In other embodiments, the ambient sounds one hears are
limited to certain channels or groups of friends.
<br/><br/> Many different forms of media content may be instantiated into the virtual social venue 100.  In one embodiment, a fully-interactive web page is instantiated on a viewing surface within the virtual social venue.  Interactivity with the webpage,
however, is preferably limited to a host who instantiates the web page or to a virtual disc jockey who is given control over the media content.  In other embodiments, described below, a video stream or widget is instantiated onto the viewing surface.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 illustrates a screen shot 600 of a web browser that is viewing media content on a computer display.  The screen shot 600 includes video content 602 being displayed from the YouTube.TM.  web site.  A browser plugin icon 604 is provided on
the toolbar of the browser.  After video content is selected within the browser, a user can click on the browser plugin icon 604.  The plugin 604 causes whatever video is being presented within the browser, to also be instantiated and played within the
venue.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 7, a screen shot 700 is provided depicting a multi-sided jumbotron monitor 704 on which the video content 602 is instantiated.  Once the video content 602 is instantiated into the virtual social venue 100, the media that is
being played is not just viewed by the user that caused the instantiation.  Rather, every participant that is within the virtual social venue 100, whether from the user's social network, or otherwise within the venue, has the instantiated video content
602 presented to them within the context of the venue, provided that the viewing screen is within that participant's field of view.  Thus, the experience of observing the video content 602 is enjoyed by all members of the venue.
<br/><br/> In addition, the selection of the monitor 704 onto which to instantiate a given media stream is customizable.  That is, the video content 602 could have been displayed on the monitor 706, or even one of the remote monitors 708.  The choice of
location for displaying externally instantiated video content 602 is definable by either the user who selected the content, or by individual users within the virtual social venue 100.
<br/><br/> Additionally, each user within the venue 100 may select one or more viewing spaces for the instantiated video content.  For example, a first user may wish to view the video content 602 on the jumbotron 704.  A second user may wish to view the
content on the monitor 708.  Mechanisms are provided to allow users to move content between display areas, as well as to queue instantiated content for later viewing.  Additionally, different users in a venue may be given different rolls: owner,
administrator, moderator, spectators and guests.  Each of these user types have different privileges and controls available to them for instantiating or moving content from external sources.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the browser plugin icon 604 may be used by an owner, administrator or moderator, to queue up content for display in a later venue.  Thus, a user can surf the web in his/her browser, and when they find desired content, can
use the browser plugin 604 to add media content to a queue, for later play.  When the venue experience begins, the content can then be placed into displays as desired.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 illustrates a screen shot 800 depicting another portion of the virtual social venue 100.  The venue 100 includes a plurality of billboards 804.  As described above, the billboards 804 are placeholders for content, whether still pictures,
data, or video.  In addition, the billboards 804 may feed content into the venue 802, either individually, where each billboard 804 contains different content, or collectively, where each billboard 804 contains the same content.  Moreover, the content
within each billboard 804 may be populated and managed by any one of the plurality of user types described above.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the content within the billboards 804 may contain advertisements that are related to the content that is being viewed within the venue 802.  For example, if the content that is being experienced by the social group within the
venue 802 is a video game, billboards 804 may "advertise" similar video games, or pre-orders for games not yet released.  If the video content being experienced within the venue 802 is a movie, billboards 804 may display trailers to movies that are
similar to that being viewed, or movies by the same director, or having the same primary actors/actresses.  The uses available for the billboards 804 are not restricted, and may relate directly or indirectly to the content being experienced within the
venue 802.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 illustrates a screen shot 900 of an online merchant where merchandise 902 advertised in the billboard 804 is shown.  In one embodiment, a user within the venue 802 that wants to purchase merchandise that is advertised on the billboard 804
simply clicks on the billboard 804.  A browser is opened, either as an overlay within the venue 802, or on a screen outside the venue 802, that provides the user with an opportunity to purchase the merchandise 902.  In the illustration shown in FIGS. 8
and 9, the merchandise is a video game.  However, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the merchandise could be any product that may be purchased, whether video games, movies, clothing, jewelry, electronics, etc. The types of products that may be
linked to the billboard 804 are not limited.  The billboards 804 may be selected for the purpose of linking the user to content outside of the venue 802, whether related or unrelated to the viewing experience within the venue 802, without interrupting or
pausing the activities going on in the virtual social venue 100.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 illustrates a screen shot 1000 of a display 1002 viewable by users within the virtual social venue 100.  In one embodiment, the display 1002 displays a plurality of video feed possibilities 1004, for instantiation into the video display
1002.  As an example, video feeds from Hulu.TM., Machinima.com.TM.  and YouTube.TM.  are shown, although others are anticipated.  Once a video feed 1004 is selected by a user (or moderator of a viewing experience), the web site associated with the video
feed is presented within the display 1002.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 illustrates a screen shot 1100 of the display 1002 after the video feed 1004 for Hulu.TM.  is selected.  At this point, a user (or video moderator) can select a video feed.  Once the video feed is selected, it begins playing on the
display 1002 and is seen by the user that selected the video feed.  More importantly, the content on the display 1002 is also viewable by everyone that is participating in the social venue.  Thus, thousands or even millions of participants in the social
venue experience the video feed that has been selected by the user.  In one embodiment, the video feed is private to the user who selected the video feed.  In another embodiment, the video feed is fed to everyone within the social venue.  Alternatively,
an administrator or moderator may select not only the video feed to be displayed, but also the group or subgroup of users within the social venue that can see the video feed.
<br/><br/> In an additional embodiment, users that are selected, or otherwise able to view the video feed, can choose to move the video feed to any display, or the display of their choice, for experiencing the content.  In this manner, a user can select
one or more video feeds for populating displays within the social venue for the enjoyment of all or subgroups of users.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 illustrates a screen shot 1200 of a widget 1202 that has been created in a browser.  In computer programming, a widget is a mini application, typically created using HTML.  Like web pages, widgets are capable of many different things,
often performing tasks that would be tedious or complicated for the user to access manually.  Widgets can be as simple as a mini program that displays the time of day, or monitors stock quotes for selected companies, but may be more sophisticated, such
as a mini program that monitors a user's real time score for players in a fantasy sporting league.  In the present embodiment, any widget that can be designed for use within an internet browser, can be instantiated into one or more displays within the 3D
social venue environment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 illustrates a screen shot 1300 of a portion 1302 of the virtual social venue 100.  Within the portion 1302 is a display 1304 onto which the widget 1202 has been instantiated.  In one embodiment, the user (or venue moderator) can select
one or more of the displays within the venue for display of any widget they desire.  In addition, the user can selectively instantiate one or more widgets onto displays that are viewable only by the user, and/or can instantiate one or more widgets onto
displays that are viewable by subgroups, groups, or anyone within the current social venue.  For example, a widget might be designed to track betting odds for two sports teams, during a game.  The betting widget could then be instantiated into a social
venue that is playing the game, so that it continuously updates the odds for the users who desire to see it.  Of course, the present invention is not be limited to any particular type of widget, or the number of users within the social venue that can
view its contents.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 illustrates a screen shot 1400 depicting a portion of the virtual social venue 100.  A display is shown onto which a widget 1402 has been instantiated (as described above with respect to FIG. 13).  In addition, a laser pointer 1404 is
shown, pointed at an area within the widget 1402.  In one embodiment, the laser is a user selectable tool provided within a platform providing the virtual social venue, to allow a user to identify an area within the venue to one or more users.  More
specifically, a user can obtain a selection tool, such as a laser (or flashlight, or crosshairs, or any of a plurality of identifiers), and can then select a portion of the social venue for identifying to other users a location that they are to examine. 
For example, if a group of users are looking for the avatar of a friend that is among the users within the social venue, and one of the users knows where the avatar is sitting, s/he can point to them using a selection tool, and all of the users in the
group can see where the user is pointing.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, a social venue may be set up for viewing a painting, or photograph, or other piece of art to be examined by a group of users.  The instructor may zoom in to the painting, to a very granular, or pixel level, and can use a
selection tool to direct the users to pay attention to a particular area that is being displayed.  Of course, many uses of pointing devices are envisioned.  What is relevant is that a user can choose a selection tool and then use that tool for display to
one or more users within the social venue.
<br/><br/> FIG. 15 illustrates a screen shot 1500 depicting a portion 1502 of the virtual social venue 100.  Streams 1504 have been overlaid onto the social venue between users that are sending or receiving digital communications in the venue.  For
example, just as users in a physical venue may send or receive digital communication (texts, chats, emails, voice communications, etc.), users within the social venue may have similar forms of communication.  In one embodiment, users can chat directly
with one or more other users, either within the social venue, or to other users that are within their social network, but not a part of the current social venue viewing experience.
<br/><br/> To allow users within the social venue to obtain a visual perspective of such communication, the present invention--preferably using the application programming interfaces of any linked extrinsic social networks--tracks the communications made
by all users within the social venue, and provides visual overlays of the communications.  For example, if two users within the social venue are chatting with each other, streams of blue light will flow between the two users, depending on where they are
sitting in the social venue, representing texts that are sent or received between the users.  In addition, if a user receives a communication from someone in their social network that is outside the social venue, a red stream will drop down from outside
the venue onto the user for which the communication is intended.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the digital communication is delayed briefly, so that the recipient does not actually receive the communication until after the stream representing the communication, arrives.  By observing streams of communications within the
social venue, a user can readily see which users are actively communicating, either by receiving messages or sending them.  Applicants envision any form of communication that can be monitored by the platform providing the virtual social venue 100 may be
visually represented within the social venue in a graphical way.
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 illustrates a screen shot 1600 depicting another portion 1602 of the virtual social venue 100.  Within the portion 1602, graphical representations 1604 are overlaid onto avatars.  In one embodiment, the avatars within the portion 1602
represent users that are participating within the virtual social venue 100.  The social media platform (described below) imports a graphical representation for each user, from his or her social network (e.g., Facebook.TM.), and overlays the graphical
representation onto the users associated avatar.  In this manner, a user's virtual avatar is made personal to the user.  That is, the avatars are not simply objects which represent each user, but rather are made personal to each user by overlaying onto
avatar, a users own photograph, or other graphical representation.  In this manner, users within the social venue may be recognized, both by friends in their social network, as well as by others within the social venue.
<br/><br/> In a typical embodiment, when a user joins the social venue, their graphical representation is imported from their social network, and overlaid onto an avatar that represents the user.  It will be appreciated that a user's choice of graphical
representation may be a picture of the user, a video, or any arbitrary image that they would like to use to represent themselves within their social network.  For instance, a user may choose to instantiate a thumbnail sketch or icon of a website, video
feed, or other virtual social venue on their avatar.
<br/><br/> The face of the avatar is just one of many surfaces that may be overlaid with extrinsically-sourced content.  Users may also purchase apparel or body art to overlay other avatar surfaces.  Also, the avatars themselves may be customized.  A cola
vendor could purchase 1000 seats in a football venue and choose cola cans or bottles or even animated cola commercials as their avatars.  The cola avatars would emote and be influenced by the crowd.
<br/><br/> FIG. 17 is a block diagram of a server network embodiment of a social media platform 1700 for instantiating two-dimensional media content in a virtual social venue.  The social media platform 1700 comprises a plurality of high speed port servers
1710, message queuing servers 1720, a database cluster 1730, logic servers 1740, security access servers 1750, proxy servers 1760, and web servers 1770.  The social media platform 1700 further comprises local logic servers 1745 running through a web
client 1780 and on a variety of client devices, including desktop clients 1702, tablets 1704, smartphones 1706, laptops and notebooks 1708, and any other processing device capable of accessing a network.
<br/><br/> When a client logs into the social media platform 1700, the client communicates through port server 1710 to message queuing server 1720.  The message queuing server 1720 talks to the security access/server 1750 to authenticate the login.  Venue
management is handled by remote logic servers 1740, through message queuing servers 1720, and local logic servers 1745 installed on each client device.  Extrinsic two-dimensional media content (such as video streams) are fed directly from the third
party's URL (e.g., Youtube) to clients.  The remote logic server 1740 directs clients in the virtual social venue to the URL.  The clients, with their local logic servers 1745, manage the extrinsic two-dimensional media content themselves, including
transforming the media to fit the structural environment provided by the virtual social venue.
<br/><br/> The client devices 1702, 1704, 1706, 1708 include a video display for presenting the instantiated media, within the context of the virtual social venue, to the user.  The media may include video (movies, television, web cams, games), audio,
still images, web browser content (web sites, web applications, widgets, computer data or applications), or any other content that may be accessed for display.  User control of the client devices 1702, 1704, 1706, 1708 is achieved using input devices,
such as a keyboard, mouse, or any other type of device.
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 is a block diagram that illustrates one embodiment of a social media platform 1800 that provides a virtual social venue 1810 including a virtual three dimensional space 1820 for sharing two-dimensional media content.  The three
dimensional space 1820 is typically a virtual three-dimensional representation of a large physical structure--such as a theater, stadium, coliseum, arena, stage, or conference center.  The virtual representation provides one or more common seating or
standing areas for an audience of virtual representations of people (e.g., avatars 1850, 1851, etc.) to sit or stand in proximity to one another.  A three-dimensional graphics engine (not shown)--preferably one suitable for generating graphics for a
massively multiplayer online game--is provided to generate the three-dimensional environment.
<br/><br/> The shared two-dimensional media content is presented on one or more viewing surfaces 1830 within the virtual three-dimensional space 1820.  FIG. 18 illustrates a virtual theater screen in a moderately-sized theater.  FIGS. 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, and
13, by comparison, illustrate a plurality of virtual billboards and jumbotron screens in a large stadium.  The shared two-dimensional media content may comprise a web page 1870, a video stream 1872, a widget 1874, or other externally sourced
two-dimensional media content 1876.
<br/><br/> When the shared two-dimensional media content comprises something that is interactive, such as a webpage with links and text fields, the social media platform 1800 enables a host user--or a user designated as a virtual disc jockey--to interact
with the shared media content.  Those interactions are displayed on the viewing surface 1830, along with the shared media content, to both the host user or virtual disc jockey and the other users admitted to the virtual social venue 1810.  When the
shared two-dimensional media content consists of web page, the social media platform 1800 is, in effect, instantiating a skinless web browser onto the viewing surface 1830 and scaling it, rotating it, skewing it, and otherwise three-dimensionally
transforming it in a manner consistent with each admitted user's unique position and orientation within the virtual three-dimensional space 1820.
<br/><br/> The virtual social venue 1810 is populated with users invited and admitted from one or more extrinsic social networks 1860.  Users admitted to the social venue 1810 are either assigned a unique or exclusive position (e.g., a seat 1840, 1841,
etc., or a standing location as shown in FIG. 2) within the social venue 1810, or they are permitted to navigate and migrate through the social venue 1810 and select an unoccupied position from which to share the media experience.  In either case, each
user is provided with a unique position and orientation within the virtual three-dimensional space to experience the shared two-dimensional media content.
<br/><br/> Each position and orientation within the virtual three-dimensional space has a different field of view 1835.  Accordingly, the social media platform 1800 displays the shared two-dimensional media content to each user with a yaw and pitch
consistent with the differences between the position and orientation provided to the user and the position and orientation of the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface.  To display the shared two-dimensional media content within this
three-dimensional context, the social media platform 1800 three-dimensionally transforms the shared two-dimensional media content--often consisting of streaming video--in real time to each user in a manner consistent with each user's unique relative
position and orientation.
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 also illustrates the importation and mapping of other extrinsic content into the virtual social venue 1810.  In one embodiment, profile pictures 1862 are imported from the one or more social networks 1860 and mapped onto the avatars
1850, 1851, etc., of admitted users.  In another embodiment, streaming facial images 1855 are imported from users' web cams and mapped onto the corresponding avatars 1850, 1851, etc. As noted in the embodiment associated with FIG. 15, text communications
1861 may also be detected and/or imported from the one or more social networks 1860 and represented within the virtual three-dimensional space.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, voice communications 1856 (or other audio expressions of participating users) are imported from users' microphones or web cams and reproduced in the virtual three-dimensional space 1820 for other participants to hear. 
Preferably, the reproduction of sounds is done after filtering the audio expressions to cancel noises sourced from the virtual social venue, including the shared media content.  Also, the audio expressions of surrounding participating users are
reproduced for each user in a surround-sound scheme correlated and consistent with the relative spatial arrangement of the participating user with surrounding participating users.  When a user's avatar turns around within the virtual social venue, the
surround-sound is rotated to that user in a manner correlated and consistent with the relative rotation of the participating user's avatar within the virtual social venue.  Also, consistent with the three-dimensional environment, the audio expressions
received by any given recipient is attenuated and delayed as a function of the virtual distance between the recipient's avatar and the producer's avatar.
<br/><br/> In yet another embodiment, detected motion gestures 1857--such as clapping and arm-waving--are imported from participating users' motion detecting apparatuses (e.g., Microsoft's Kinect.TM.  device or another third party gross motion, gesture,
and/or emotion detecting device) and imitated through animations of their avatars.  In this embodiment, each user who enters the virtual social venue 1810 is provided with a three-dimensional animated avatar that can render any of a plurality of
emotional expressions with corresponding virtual physical gestures (e.g., jumping, arm-waving, cheering, booing, clapping).
<br/><br/> FIG. 19 illustrates one embodiment of a virtual social venue 1910 with toolbars for inviting friends, identifying admitted friends, identifying the virtual "disc jockey" of a social media event, and expressing emotional responses.  Typically, a
virtual social venue 1910 will be populated with users who are friends, or friends of friends, etc., of a host user.  To participate in the virtual social venue 1910, each user--including the host user--authorizes the social media platform 1800 to access
information associated with the user's social network account, including the identities of friends.  The social media platform 1800 uses this information to populate a friend toolbar 1965 with thumbnails 1962 of profile pictures of friends retrieved from
a host user's one or more social networks.  The thumbnails 1962 are arranged by alphabetical order of the corresponding friend's names.  When a host user hovers their selection tool (e.g., mouse pointer) over a thumbnail 1962, the virtual social venue
1910 displays the corresponding friend's name.  A host user can invite friends to join the virtual social venue by selecting the thumbnails 1962.  Toolbar scroll arrows 1967 enable the host user to scroll through the thumbnail images 1962.
<br/><br/> The social media platform 1800 also populates a guest toolbar 1970 with thumbnails 1972 of the profile pictures of users who accept the invitation and are admitted into the virtual social venue 1910.  The social media platform 1800 also
populates a larger box 1975 with the thumbnail image of the host user or virtual disc jockey--that is, the user who is controlling which media content to display and share on the viewing surface 1830.  The social media platform 1800 also provides an
"emot" toolbar 1980 comprising selectable text or icons with which users can indicate an emotional response (such as booing, clapping, or laughing) to the shared media content.
<br/><br/> FIG. 20 is a block diagram illustrating feature customization for an avatar 2010 with multiple customizable features.  As illustrated in function block 2020, users are provided with the ability to select an avatar 2010 and customize various
avatar features, such as height, size, hair style, etc. Users may purchase fashionable virtual clothing from an avatar apparel store 2030 with which to clothe their avatar 2010.  As illustrated in function block 2040, users may navigate their avatars
2010 to a selected position and orientation within a virtual social venue, and the avatar will animate in a manner (e.g., walking or turning) consistent with those navigation movements.  As illustrated in function block 2050, users may also make their
avatars 2010 gesture and express emotional responses.  As illustrated in function block 2060, the user's social network profile picture may be mapped onto the avatar's face.  And as illustrated in function block 2070, the user's voice and text
communications may be represented by the avatar's facial and lip movements or by other representations (such as streams of light or text bubbles) in proximity to the avatar 2010.
<br/><br/> FIG. 21 depicts one embodiment of a process 2100 of integrating social media into a social media platform.  Process 2100 begins with granting access to a social venue within the social media platform to a participant through an entry point
(operation 2101).  In one embodiment, the entry point is a website dedicated to operating and managing the social media platform.  This website can be generated by a social media module.  Alternatively, the entry point can be a widget, banner, or other
link within, or external to, one or more originating platforms online social media network with which the participant is associated.  The participants may be associated with multiple social media networks.  The entry point can be generated by a viral
feature of the online social network.  For example, an invitation from the participant to a contact to join in the social media platform can cause a link to be placed in the contact's inbox.  Once the contact clicks on this link, he or she is granted
access to the social venue within the social media platform.  Other viral features may be used as an entry point to the social media platform such as newsfeeds and minifeeds generated within the originating social media platforms.
<br/><br/> Once a participant is granted access to the social media platform, the participant's social graph having contacts information of the participant is automatically ported into the platform so that the viral features of the originating online
social media network can be integrated with the social media platform (operation 2103).  At operation 2105, the participant is prompted to invite one or more contacts from the participant's social graph to join in the combined social media platform.  If
any contacts accept the invitation, they become additional participants (operation 2106) and the process repeats.  Social media events associated with the participants who joined in the MMOG can also be streamed into the social venue from their
respective originating online social networks (operation 2107).  These social media event streams may be displayed in real-time while the participants are interacting with the combined social media platform (operation 2109).  In addition, the type and
quantity of social media event streams received by an individual participant are user-configurable.  The social media event streams may also be turned off at any time by each participant.  Additionally, the social media events may be displayed on any
display area within the combined social media platform.  For example, the social media events may be displayed on a display screen or monitor, wall, billboard, blimp, rocket, airplane, or fireworks display within the combined social media platform, to
name a few.  This completes process 2100.
<br/><br/> FIG. 22 is a block diagram illustrating one embodiment of an environment 2200 for a social media platform.  More specifically, a social media platform 2206 is coupled to a network 2212.  User devices 2210 are also coupled to the network 2212,
and access social venues 2204 via the network 2212.  When a user device logs into a social venue 2204, the social media platform 2206 imports metadata associated with the user of the user device 2210 from their profile in their social network 2202.  This
allows the graphical representation described above with respect to FIG. 16 to be displayed on the user's associated avatar.
<br/><br/> As a user experiences content within their social venue 2204, they can choose to react to the content in many ways.  They can clap, cheer, stand up, yell, boo, rate the video, etc. The social media platform 2206 records emotive activity of users
over time during presentation of content played within a social venue and stores their emotive activity in an emot database 2208.  The emotive activity correlates in time with the video content that is presented within the social venue.  Since the
emotive activity is recorded in sync with the content that is experienced, it is possible to reconstruct emotive activity of a user.
<br/><br/> With this in mind, ghost avatars may exist within social venues 2204.  More specifically, if content has been presented in a social venue 2204, and users have had emotive activity during presentation of the content, then the emotive activity is
stored in the emot database 2208.  If at a later time, the content is presented to other users, then ghost avatars from the previous viewing can appear within the social venue 2204, and their emotive activity can be presented alongside activity expressed
by live users.  Thus, the experience of viewing content can be cumulatively enhanced as more and more users view the content and their emotive activity is recorded.  For example, a user might be viewing content with only a few other live users.  However,
the social venue 2204 may have been previously viewed by thousands of others.  In one embodiment, the cumulative emotive activity of all users that have viewed the content may be replayed along with the content, thus enhancing the overall viewing
experience of the live users.
<br/><br/> FIG. 23 is another functional block diagram of an embodiment of a social media platform 2300 for implementing a virtual social venue.  The social media platform 2300 includes a three-dimensional graphics engine 2310 that generates the
three-dimensional environment for the virtual social venue.  The social media platform 2300 also includes a virtual representation of three-dimensional space--that is, a spatial architecture 2330 for the virtual social venue.  The social media platform
2300 also provides customizable avatar form and appearance templates 2340, enabling users to adopt an avatar with a form and appearance to their liking.
<br/><br/> The social media platform 2300 leverages the social relational data and communications facilities of extrinsic social networks to populate the virtual social venue and--in effect--to bring it to life.  The social media platform 2300 includes one
or more data interfaces 2322 to extrinsic social networks that use application programming interfaces associated with those social networks to authenticate users and pass and retrieve information (such as text communications and friend lists) to and from
those social networks.  Communications between admitted users, such as user texts or chats 2325, is preferably handled by the one or more extrinsic social networks and then represented in the virtual social venue in some form (such as text bubbles or
streams of light).
<br/><br/> The social media platform 2300 populates the virtual social venue with users invited and admitted from one or more social networks 2320.  The social media platform 2300 includes a user list 2328 to track all of the users admitted to the social
venue.  The social media platform 2300 also continually tracks user spatial data 2342, such as the position and orientation of each user's avatar, as various users navigate and migrate about the venue social venue.
<br/><br/> The social media platform 2300 also leverages media content sourced from extrinsic media providers.  The social media platform 2300 includes a browser plug-in interface 2360 enabling an interactive browser web page 2350 to be instantiated (with
its interactive features maintained) onto a viewing surface within the three-dimensional environment provided by the virtual social venue.  The social media platform 2300 also includes a streaming media interface 2362 enabling streaming media content
2352 from a third party streaming media provider to be instantiated within the three-dimensional environment.  The social media platform 2300 also includes a widget interface 2364 enabling a widget 2354 to execute within the three-dimensional
environment.
<br/><br/> The social media platform 2300 also includes a client user interface 2344 for presenting the virtual social venue to a client and receiving and responding to user navigation and control 2346.  User navigation and controls 2346 include commands
related to the navigation of a user's avatar, selection of friends to invite to the virtual social venue, and emotional responses to the third party media content.
<br/><br/> FIG. 24 is a block diagram 2400 of user-related data maintained by one embodiment of the social media platform 2300.  The social media platform 2300 includes a user list 2410 identifying each user admitted to or participating in a virtual social
venue.  The social media platform 2300 also includes, for each user, a basic user information record 2420 including fields for the user's unique id, profile name, and Boolean flags indicating whether the user is active and/or logged in. The social media
platform 2300 also maintains a record 2430 identifying information related to the location and spatial position of each user's avatar.  This includes an avatar ID, a venue ID, seat ID, authorization ID, X, Y, and Z position, as well as the yaw, pitch,
roll, and relative zoom extent of the user's field of view.
<br/><br/> FIG. 25 is a functional block diagram 2500 of one embodiment of a method for instantiating two-dimensional media content in a three-dimensional platform.  Functional block 2510 provides a user interface comprising a navigable three-dimensional
space.  Functional block 2520 provides one or more virtual screens, windows, or other viewing surfaces within the virtual three-dimensional space.  Functional block 2530 instantiates externally-sourced two-dimensional content onto the virtual screens,
windows, or other viewing surfaces.  The two-dimensional content may comprise a fully-interactive web page 2532, a video stream 2534, a widget 2536, or some other content.
<br/><br/> Functional block 2540 provides the user with a representation, position and orientation within the virtual three-dimensional space.  The representation of the user is typically in the form of an avatar.  The avatar's position (e.g., a seat or
standing location) may be automatically determined, selected and assigned by the host, or the user may be given the ability and privilege to navigate his/her avatar to a user-selected position within the virtual three-dimensional space.  The user is also
provided with the ability to rotate the avatar or the avatar's head to a selected orientation within the virtual three-dimensional space.  The user is provided with a field of view consistent with the selected position and orientation of the user's
avatar (or other representation) within the virtual three-dimensional space.
<br/><br/> Function block 2550 drives the externally-sourced two-dimensional content directly from the third party provider to each user.  The two-dimensional content is spatially transformed (preferably using rendering software installed on each user's
machine) to fit the context of the virtual three-dimensional space.  This includes transforming the two-dimensional content to a yaw and pitch consistent with the relative orientations and positions of each user and viewing surface.  If any portion of
the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface is within a user's field of view, that portion of the instantiated two-dimensional media content will be displayed to that user.
<br/><br/> Function block 2560 maintains any ability to interact with the instantiated content within the three-dimensional environment.  For example, if a web page with text fields and links is instantiated on the virtual screen, window, or other viewing
surface, then the user is able to interact with the instantiated web page from within the virtual three-dimensional space.  This includes enabling the user to type into the text field and to select any link on the web page from within the virtual
three-dimensional space.
<br/><br/> FIG. 26 is a functional block diagram 2600 of one embodiment of a method for sharing two-dimensional media content with users from a social network in a three-dimensional platform.  Functional block 2610 provides a virtual social venue
comprising a navigable three-dimensional space.  The three-dimensional space typically includes a large physical structure that provides one or more seating or standing areas for an audience of virtual representations of people (e.g., avatars) to sit or
stand in proximity to one another.
<br/><br/> Functional block 2620 provides the ability to invite users from the social network to participate in the virtual social venue.  This ability may be limited to a single host user or extended to multiple hosts or even to all users, until the
social venue reaches its admittance capacity.  Functional block 2630 provides three-dimensional animated avatars to admitted users and populates the seating or standing area with the avatars.
<br/><br/> Functional block 2630 provides one or more screens, billboards, windows, or other viewing surfaces in the three-dimensional space on which to instantiate the extrinsically-sourced two-dimensional media.  Functional block 2650 bequeaths a user
with disc jockey privileges over typically just one of the screens, billboards, windows, or viewing surfaces.  A user with disc-jockey privileges controls and selects the extrinsically-sourced two-dimensional media content to share with the audience on
the viewing surface the disc jockey controls.  The disc jockey can also interact with the instantiated media content from within the virtual three-dimensional space.  Typically, other viewing surfaces will be occupied by advertisements related either to
the content to be shown or to one or more users' consumer interests.
<br/><br/> Functional block 2660 spatially transforms the extrinsically-sourced media to fit the perspective of each user's avatar.  As noted before, each avatar has a unique position and corresponding field of view from within the virtual social venue. 
Functional block 2470 displays the extrinsically-sourced media while simultaneously displaying the avatars of neighboring participating users to each of the participating users.  In other words, the virtual social venue and any instantiated media content
is displayed to each avatar from that avatar's unique perspective and field of view.  This includes transforming the instantiated media content to a yaw and pitch consistent with the relative orientations and positions of each user's avatar to the
viewing surface.
<br/><br/> Functional block 2680 enables users to navigate about the three-dimensional space, and to zoom the viewing surface into full view, while adjusting the spatial display and three-dimensional transformations accordingly.  Simply by turning the
scroll wheel of a mouse, a user can zoom in from the default perspective that his/her avatar would have in the virtual social venue to a view in which the instantiated media content is full-screen and orthogonal (no longer three-dimensionally
transformed).  By turning the scroll wheel of the mouse in the opposite direction, the user can zoom back out, all the way from a full-screen view back to the default perspective.  In a preferred embodiment, the user can continue to zoom out from the
default position, giving the user a view of not only the objects in front of the user's avatar, but also the user's avatar itself and the surrounding context.  These tools enhance the user's control over and potential appreciation of the social
experience in sharing the instantiated media content.
<br/><br/> It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various embodiments are implemented on computer hardware, software, firmware, and combinations thereof.  The teachings of this description can be adapted to a variety of computer
architectures.  The various functions of the illustrated embodiments are implemented through programs of instructions stored in memory and configured to execute on various computer processors.
<br/><br/> Having thus described exemplary embodiments of the present invention, it should be noted that the foregoing disclosure and associated drawings are exemplary only, and that various other alternatives, adaptations, and modifications may be made
within the scope of the present invention.  Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments illustrated herein, but is limited only by the following claims.
