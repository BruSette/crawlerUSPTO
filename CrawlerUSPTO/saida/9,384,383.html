       <font size="+1">Stymieing of facial recognition systems
</font><br/>
       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> For surreptitiously stymieing a recognition of facial characteristics by
     a facial recognition system using a camera, a user wears an object in
     front of at least one eye, where the object includes a light displacer.
     The light displacer optically displaces light radially relative to the
     original light direction, but still parallel to the original light
     direction so that a view by the eye through the light displacer is not
     distorted. With the light displacer, there is an apparent position of the
     eye perceived by the camera which is shifted relative to other features
     of the face and relative to the actual position of the eye. Consequently,
     an image of the face obtained by the camera locates the eye at the
     apparent position which is substantially different from an image which
     would have been obtained with the actual position of the eye, so that the
     facial recognition system is stymied.

<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> Facial recognition technology has, at the time of filing of this application, mainly been used in the United States by various national security agencies and police forces.  While there has been some use of facial recognition technology in the
private sector, these have been fairly limited.  However, facial recognition technology has recently been incorporated in private security systems, such as those used for gambling casinos, and as a component in other software systems such as <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b>
just to name a few of those applications.  Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on one's perspective, technology prognosticators have predicted an explosion in commercial products employing facial recognition technology in the fairly near future.
<br/><br/> Facial recognition technology generally requires three functional components: a) an image of a face, which is taken from a digital camera or a video frame taken from a video camera, or any other image taken by a suitable camera and which can be
digitized; b) facial recognition software to analyze the acquired image of the face; and c) a computer or other computational equipment needed to run the software and provide a database or a link to a database.  Because all three of these components are
becoming increasingly powerful, cheaper, and smaller quickly, it is believed that facial recognition is no longer going to be primarily limited to governmental security functions but instead will find itself incorporated in a wide array of other
government and non-government activities and in particular commercial applications.
<br/><br/> It will be appreciated that many facial recognition systems operate by obtaining an image of the person's face to be identified, and then by quantifying the location of various anatomical points or nodal points (landmarks) of the face, including
the location(s) of the eye(s) as well as parts of and around the eye(s).  The dimensions, locations and/or ratios of these points typically make up a "faceprint", which is then compared to a database of similar metrics (faceprints) to determine, where
there is a match from the database, the identity of the face being scanned.
<br/><br/> Thus, while the legitimate security functions of government and police agencies should not be circumvented, there are many individuals that would desire not to have their identity automatically and secretly determined in a non-security setting,
such as inside a shopping mall.  Fortunately, facial recognition technology is still not foolproof.  Obviously, if one wears a mask over one's face, covers one's face with one's hand, or wears a fake nose and glasses, the recognition systems can be
easily disrupted or potentially defeated.  However, most people would not desire to walk around with a sock cap or the like pulled down over their face or with their hand or a magazine held up in front of their face for this obvious purpose, and in doing
so would likely be recognized as doing so for the purpose of facial recognition system disruption.
<br/><br/> Large dark sunglasses can also be worn in an attempt to disrupt a facial recognition system.  However, the problem with large dark sunglasses is that they can be seen by others, and can be seen as an attempt to hide identity in locations such as
a shopping mall where dark glasses are not typically used.  Furthermore, dark sunglasses tend to reduce light levels, and therefore reduce vision under lower light conditions such as at night or indoors.
<br/><br/> Thus, it would be useful to have a method or device which would not be obvious to passersby or a facial recognition system as a facial recognition stymier or an attempt to defeat a facial recognition system, but which would alter ones appearance
or facial characteristics as one passes by a facial recognition system surreptitiously.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method and apparatus for surreptitiously stymieing a recognition of facial characteristics of an individual by a facial recognition system, where the facial recognition system is
designed to determine the locations of the eyes of a face of the individual as well as the location of other facial features of the individual when viewed by a camera of the facial recognition system.  Stymieing of the facial recognition system is
achieved by wearing of an object by the individual in front of the eyes of the individual, where the object includes a light displacer located adjacent at least one of the eyes of the individual but otherwise not covering other facial features.  The
light displacer optically displaces light passing therethrough radially relative to the original light direction, but with the emerging radially displaced light being parallel to the original light direction.  As a result, light reflected from the at
least one of the eyes of the individual and passing through the light displacer to the camera is displaced radially but parallel relative to a direction of the reflected light received by the camera of the facial recognition system.  With these effects,
an individual's view by the at least one eye through the light displacer is not distorted.  In addition, there is an apparent position of the at least one eye perceived by the camera looking through the light displacer which is shifted relative to other
features of the face perceived by the camera by light not passing through the light displacer and relative to the actual position of the at least one eye.  Consequently, an image of the face of the individual obtained by the camera of the facial
recognition system locates the at least one eye at the apparent position which is substantially different from an image which would have been obtained with the actual position of the at least one eye, so that facial recognition by the facial recognition
system is stymied.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a second light displacer is also located adjacent the other at least one of the eyes of the individual but otherwise not covering other facial features the face.  As with the first-mentioned light
displacer, the second light displacer also optically displaces light passing therethrough radially relative to the original light direction, but with the emerging radially displaced light being parallel to the original light direction.  Consequently, an
image of the face of the individual obtained by the camera of the facial recognition system locates both eyes at the apparent positions, which is substantially different from an image which would have been obtained with the actual position of both eyes,
so that facial recognition by the facial recognition system is stymied.  Where two light displacers are used, each can displace the light laterally or medially, or a combination of various directions including upwards and downwards.
<br/><br/> In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the object worn is a pair of glasses with the light displacer or light displacers located where the lenses of the pair of glasses would typically be located.  The light displacer is conveniently: two
mirrors which together serve to radially but parallelly displace light reflected thereby; a prism; or a pair of prisms which can be conventional prisms or Fresnel prisms or a combination of both.  While the robustness of facial recognition systems vary,
it is believed that displacing of the light by at least about 1 mm per eye, or 2 mm total, would be sufficient for satisfactory stymieing in most commercial situations.
<br/><br/> It is an advantage of the present invention that an individual can change the appearance of their facial image as picked up by a camera of a facial recognition system without making the change apparent or noticeable to other passersby, and with
this change thereby stymie recognition of their facial characteristics by the facial recognition system.
<br/><br/> It is also an advantage of the present invention that the object which is worn to stymie the facial recognition system is a commonly worn object, so the use of the object to stymie would also not be apparent to passersby.
<br/><br/> It is a further advantage of the present invention that the normal sight of the user is not affected.
<br/><br/> It is still another advantage of the present invention that all features viewed by a facial recognition system through the light displacer will be displaced.
<br/><br/> Other features and advantages of the present invention are stated in or apparent from detailed descriptions of presently preferred embodiments of the invention found hereinbelow. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a front elevation view of a pair of glasses with the associated components shown schematically relative to the eyes of the user and is thus used for surreptitiously stymieing a facial recognition system in accordance with the present
invention.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a front elevation view of an alternative embodiment of a pair of glasses with the associated components shown schematically as in FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a front elevation view of another alternative embodiment of a pair of glasses with the associated components shown schematically as in FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a front elevation view of still another alternative embodiment of a pair of glasses with the associated components shown schematically as in FIG. 1.
<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> With reference now to the drawings in which like numerals represent like elements throughout the views, there is schematically depicted in FIG. 1 a pair of glasses 10 having a typical frame which is worn by an individual or user, which user is
schematically depicted by eyes 12l and 12r and nose 14 only.  It will be appreciated that glasses 10 are an exemplary embodiment of an object to be worn by the user for stymieing a facial recognition system in accordance with the present invention. 
While glasses 10 are considered the most likely object to be used for this purpose, other similar objects can also be used for the same effect which would be obvious to those of ordinary skill, such as a monocle, goggles, dark glasses (mostly for outside
use) or a clip-on addition to normal glasses.  But a simple pair of ordinary looking glasses is considered the preferred embodiment, since people wearing glasses are so ubiquitous, and so embodiments utilizing glasses 10 are described below to serve the
purpose of surreptitiously stymieing a facial recognition system.
<br/><br/> The schematic depiction in FIG. 1 shows eyes 12l and 12r (above glasses 10) of the individual as they would be imaged by a facial recognition system when not looking through glasses 10.  In particular, the facial recognition system image would
determine the correct or actual separation of pupils 16l and 16r (and/or other viewable features of or around the eyes, or the eyes as a whole, as desired, but for convenience reference is just made to the pupils hereafter) as viewed relative to one
another and the locations of the eyes relative to nose 14 and any other selected anatomical points or features of the individual as typically utilized by the facial recognition system.  Such an image would readily allow a proper identification of the
individual by the facial recognition system if that individual was part of the facial recognition system database of individuals.
<br/><br/> However, with glasses 10 appearing as normal glasses and being worn as usual by the user, the facial recognition system image would instead determine an incorrect (not actual) separation of pupils 16l and 16r (and all other features viewed
through glasses 10), as viewed relative to one another, and their locations relative to nose 14 and other selected features of the individual as typically utilized by the facial recognition system.  As shown, the image of glasses 10 obtained by the
facial recognition system would show pupils 16l and 16r at apparent or perceived locations 18l and 18r, which as evident are different from the actual pupil positions 16l' and 16r' behind glasses 10 as shown in broken lines (that is, actual pupil
positions 16l' and 16r' are where pupils 16l and 16r would have been imaged if not for the present invention and when regular glasses were worn).  Such a distorted image would not readily allow a proper identification of the individual by the facial
recognition system if that individual was part of the facial recognition system database of individuals, so that facial recognition of the individual would be stymied.
<br/><br/> The present invention achieves this stymieing of the facial recognition system by shifting light beams 20l and 20r reflected from eyes 16l and 16r toward the camera or the like of the facial recognition system by use of light displacers 22l and
22r.  As the construction and effects of light displacers 22l and 22r are the same, only light displacer 22r will be described in detail.  Initially, it will be appreciated that light displacer 22r is depicted as it would be rotated 90.degree.  out of
the page, in order to schematically show the effect light dispenser 22r has on light beam 20r.  As thus shown, light displacer 22r includes two mirrors 24a and 24b which are mounted where lenses would normally be in glasses 10, and which mostly otherwise
appear as lenses of glasses would appear since eye 12r of the user is mostly viewable.
<br/><br/> As schematically shown in FIG. 1, mirrors 24 are carefully mounted or constructed relative to one another cause light beam 20r to be displaced radially relative to the original light beam 20r direction (in this case laterally or rightward) but
otherwise parallel relative to the original light beam 20r direction and parallel to the direction of other light reflected from the face to the camera, such as from nose 14.  As a result of this radial but parallel displacement, it will be important to
appreciate that the user's view as seen through eye 12r and light displacer 22r is not distorted, so the user is not discomforted nor does the user have any perception problems relating to the user's normal vision.  However, for a camera of the facial
recognition system, there is a perceived pupil position 18r of pupil 16r of eye 12r viewed through glasses 10 which is different (radially displaced) from the actual pupil position 16r' shown by broken lines (or an actual position of eye 12r which is not
shown by broken lines for convenience) which would be seen with normal lenses in glasses (or without glasses 10).  The perceived pupil position 18r is thus seen to be shifted rightward or laterally relative to the actual pupil position 16r' (or actual
right eye position), and this shifting distance is shown by distance arrow 26.  This shifting is relative to other features of the face perceived by the camera by reflected light not passing through light displacer 22r as well.
<br/><br/> In operation, by use of light displacer 22r, an image of the face of the individual obtained by the camera of the facial recognition system locates eye 12r or pupil 16r at the apparent position identified by perceived pupil position 18r.  This
perceived pupil position 18r is substantially different from an image which would have been obtained with the actual pupil position 16r' shown for pupil 16r of eye 12r without light displacer 22r, so that facial recognition by the facial recognition
system is stymied by having improper or incorrect data.  The lateral displacement is schematically shown by distance arrow 26.
<br/><br/> A similar displacement is achieved by light displacer 22l as noted above for light dispenser 22r and as shown.  While one displacement using only one light displacer 22 would be possible and effective, in the preferred embodiment, paired light
displacers 22l and 224 are used for double the displacement effect as shown and to maintain the same symmetry of the location of the eyes of the user.  It will also be appreciated that due to having light beams going through light displacers 22 ending up
parallel when the light beams leave light displacers 22, the vision of the user is not distorted, and those viewing the user's face would not see the eyes or face as having been distorted since there is a wide variety of pupil spacings in the human
population.
<br/><br/> In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention in FIG. 1, the appearance of the back or non-mirrored side of mirror 24b in glasses 10 will be potentially appear a little abnormal to a viewer, since the back side would not be transparent. 
The amount of this abnormal appearance is exaggerated in FIG. 1 for convenience, and thus in an actual embodiment would be more modest.  And while the mirrored side of mirror 24a would not be transparent either, the viewable portion would appear as if it
were transparent since a viewer will simply see the eye (in mirror 24a) as expected behind the normal appearing glasses 10, without any indication that a mirror is present and that the eye location has been displaced.  It will also be appreciated that
the size and effect of mirrors 24 have been exaggerated for an easier explanation of the effects achieved.
<br/><br/> Depicted in FIG. 2 is a more preferred embodiment of the present invention which eliminates somewhat the problem of an appearance of a non-transparent portion being viewed in glasses 10.  In this embodiment, which is thus considered more
practical, the same elements have been labeled with the same numbers as in FIG. 1.  Thus, it will be seen that this FIG. 2 embodiment utilizes, instead of mirrors 24, oblique rectangular prisms 34l and 34r which effect an internal reflection of light
beams 20l and 20r.  The effect of prisms 34 is thus the same as mirrors 24, in that the light beams 20l and 20r are internally reflected therein and hence radially shifted as shown by distance arrow 26; and thus there are perceived pupil positions 18l
and 18r which are different from actual pupil positions 16l' and 16r'.  In this embodiment, there would still be a small area adjacent the nose of glasses 10 where no reflected light is seen to pass through prisms 34.  But as this area would seem to be
transparent, it would appear to be simply a distorted part of what would be assumed by a viewer to be a lens of glasses 10, and so it is submitted that it would raise little attention.
<br/><br/> In another more preferred embodiment depicted in FIG. 3, the problem of an appearance of a non-transparent or distorted portion being seen next to the nose of glasses 10 is eliminated.  In this embodiment, which is thus considered still more
practical, the same elements have been labeled with the same numbers as in FIGS. 1 and 2.  Thus, it will be seen that this FIG. 3 embodiment utilizes, instead of mirrors 24 or prisms 34, paired right triangular prisms 44a and 44b which are shown spaced
apart.  Each prism 44a and 44b effects an equal but opposite deflection of light beams 20l and 20r, so that together radial but parallel displacement of light beams 20l and 20r is achieved as shown.  The effect of prisms 44a and 44b is thus the same as
in the previous embodiments, in that the light beams 20l and 20r are shifted as shown by distance arrow 26; and thus there is a perceived pupil position 18l and 18r which is different from the actual pupil position 16l' and 16r'.  Since prisms 44a and
44b would have a small thickness, there would effectively be no area adjacent the nose where no reflected light is seen to pass through, so that prisms 44a and 44b would appear to be a part of what would be assumed to be a normal lens of glasses 10 and
thus they would raise no attention from a viewer.
<br/><br/> In still another preferred embodiment depicted in FIG. 4, a setup similar to that of FIG. 3 is employed and utilized to the same basic effect and with the same elements labeled with the same numbers as in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3.  However, it will be
appreciated that in this embodiment, instead of shifting or displacing pupils 16 radially outward (laterally), pupils 16 are shifted radially inward (medially) as shown.  This is achieved by reversing the positions of prisms 44a and 44b from that shown
in FIG. 3.
<br/><br/> As noted above, it is a critical feature of the present invention that the visual axis of the user is not disturbed, so that only small radial but ultimately parallel displacements of light beams are effected.  It will thus be appreciated that
while the displacements described above have all been radially rightward or leftward (lateral or medial), it is also within the scope of the present invention to effect upward and/or downward displacements, or any combination of the same or different
(e.g., up and left for one eye, down and left for the other eye) radial displacements from the normal viewing axis.  It is also considered that only one pupil (or eye) displacement might be sufficiently effective, but that two symmetrical displacements
would be more effective and appear less artificial even upon closer scrutiny.
<br/><br/> The various elements of the embodiments shown in the figures, and the size of displacement arrows 26 of light beams 20, have been depicted for ease of illustration and are not necessarily to any scale.  It will be appreciated that a minimum
displacement of a light beam by at least about 1 mm per eye (but not in the same direction), or 2 mm total for only one eye, is considered to be sufficient for most commercial situations where the present invention would be used.  However, a displacement
of at least about 2 mm per eye or 4 mm total would be preferred for surer stymieing.  And while greater displacements are possible, it is also considered that a single displacement of no more than about 5 mm per eye, or 1 cm total, would be more than a
sufficient distance for satisfactory stymieing in most commercial situations.
<br/><br/> Obviously, greater displacements are possible, and different embodiments would lend themselves to different displacements.  For example, the embodiment of FIG. 1 where mirrors are used for the light displacers could achieve an eye displacement
greater than a centimeter, though at some point beyond a centimeter of displacement the glasses 10 would not look much like a normal pair of glasses and that would not be desired.  Similar large displacements could be achieved with the embodiment of FIG.
2 using oblique rectangular prisms, with the same limitation on size of displacement versus appearance.  The embodiments of FIGS. 3-5 provide a more limited displacement relative to the other two embodiments.  However, these embodiments are considered to
be the more practical embodiments, or the more likely commercial embodiments, since the above noted minimum and maximum displacements are still easily achieved but with a more normal appearance of glasses 10.
<br/><br/> Various light displacers have been disclosed above, but it will be appreciated that other light displacers with the same effects are also possible.  For example, a Fresnel element(s) achieving a light displacement as described above could be
used for a relatively thinner light displacer.  Of course, Fresnel elements are seen to have small visible lines therein due to the grooves thereof, and so this appearance would be somewhat of a drawback to their use in a surreptitious system.
<br/><br/> Thus, while the present invention has been described with respect to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that variations and modifications can be effected within the scope and spirit of the
invention.
