<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, wherein the environment comprises real world objects, and wherein the set of surfaces includes surfaces in top, bottom, left, right, and front view of the user;  and wherein the display is a head mounted display.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1, wherein assigning the surface priority level to each surface in the set of surfaces comprises: assigning the surface priority level based on: areas of the set of surfaces, orientations of the set of surfaces, and
locations of the set of surfaces relative to field of view of the user, wherein the plurality of surface priority levels include high, medium and low surface priority levels.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 1, wherein assigning the content priority level to each content item in a set of augmented reality contents for display with respect to the set of surfaces in the environment comprises: assigning the content priority
level based on at least one of: aspect ratio of the set of surfaces with respect to the set of augmented reality contents to be displayed, and background color of the set of surfaces with respect to the set of augmented reality contents to be displayed.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 1, wherein assigning the content priority level to each content item in a set of augmented reality contents for display with respect to the set of surfaces in the environment comprises: assigning the content priority
level based on a history of prior use patterns of the user in the environment.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 5, wherein assigning the content priority level based on a history of prior use patterns of the user in the environment comprises at least one of: selecting a first set of augmented reality contents for display in
response to a determination of the user being at work;  selecting a second set of augmented reality contents for display in response to a determination of the user being at home;  selecting a third set of augmented reality contents for display in
response to a determination of the user being in a business meeting;  and selecting a fourth set of augmented reality contents for display in response to a determination of the user being in a social event.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 6, wherein the first set of augmented reality contents includes application programs for communication and documentation the user is accustomed to use at work;  and the second set of augmented reality contents includes
application programs for communication and entertainment the user is accustomed to use at home.

<br/><br/> The present disclosure relates to the field of augmented reality.  In particular, the present disclosure relates to user interface for augmented reality enabled devices.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Head mounted displays may be configured to allow users to see the world in front of them, while still able to read their email, get stock quotes, etc. However, a common issue with existing devices is that they can lead to information overload as
the user has to view the real world, and also has to change focus to view the AR content.  Another issue with existing devices is that they do not prioritize and organize the available areas in view of the user based on the contents to be displayed. 
FIG. 1 illustrates an example of information displayed according to certain conventional applications.  As shown in FIG. 1, various advertisements are placed on the screen of a display.  Some of the advertisements, for example 152, 154, and 156 may have
blocked certain parts of the scene from the user.  Thus, the conventional applications have not effectively integrated augmented reality contents into the environment while enabling users to interact with their surrounding naturally, which may adversely
impact users' experience with the head mounted displays.
<br/><br/> Therefore, there is a need for methods and devices that can address the above issues of conventional solutions.

<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates a block diagram of the augmented reality enabled device of FIG. 4 according to some aspects of the present disclosure.  In some implementations, the head mounted device 400 may operate as part of a system in which a sensor
array 500 may provide data to a processor 507 that performs operations of the various embodiments described herein, and communicates data to and receives data from a server.  Note that the processor 507 of head mounted device 400 may include more than
one processor (or a multi-core processor) in which a core processor may perform overall control functions while a coprocessor executes applications, sometimes referred to as an application processor.  The core processor and applications processor may be
configured in the same microchip package, such as a multi-core processor, or in separate chips.  Also, the processor 507 may be packaged within the same microchip package with processors associated with other functions, such as wireless communications
(i.e., a modem processor), navigation (e.g., a processor within a GPS receiver), and graphics processing (e.g., a graphics processing unit or "GPU").
<br/><br/> The head mounted device 400 may communicate with a communication system or network that may include other computing devices, such as personal computers and mobile devices with access to the Internet.  Such personal computers and mobile devices
may include an antenna 551, a transmitter/receiver or transceiver 552 and an analog to digital converter 553 coupled to a processor 507 to enable the processor to send and receive data via a wireless communication network.  For example, mobile devices,
such as cellular telephones, may access the Internet via a wireless communication network (e.g., a Wi-Fi or cellular telephone data communication network).  Such wireless communication networks may include a plurality of base stations coupled to a
gateway or Internet access server coupled to the Internet.  Personal computers may be coupled to the Internet in any conventional manner, such as by wired connections via an Internet gateway (not shown) or by a wireless communication network.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 5, the head mounted device 400 may include a scene sensor 500 and an audio sensor 505 coupled to a control system processor 507 which may configured with a number of modules 510-550.  In an embodiment, the processor 507 or
scene sensor 500 may apply an anatomical feature recognition algorithm to the images to detect one or more anatomical features.  The processor 507 associated with the control system may review the detected anatomical features in order to recognize one or
more gestures and process the recognized gestures as an input command.  For example, as discussed in more detail below, a user may execute a movement gesture corresponding to an input command, such as pointing a finger at the virtual object to close the
virtual object.  In response to recognizing this example gesture, the processor 507 may remove the virtual object from the display.  As another example, the user may touch the forefinger to the thumb on one hand to form the "OK" sign in order to confirm
an instruction or option presented on the display.
<br/><br/> The scene sensor 500, which may include stereo cameras, orientation sensors (e.g., accelerometers and an electronic compass) and distance sensors, may provide scene-related data (e.g., images) to a scene manager 510 implemented within the
processor 507 which may be configured to interpret three-dimensional scene information.  In various embodiments, the scene sensor 500 may include stereo cameras (as described below) and distance sensors, which may include infrared light emitters for
illuminating the scene for an infrared camera.  For example, in an embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5, the scene sensor 500 may include a stereo red-green-blue (RGB) camera 503a for gathering stereo images, and an infrared camera 503b configured to image
the scene in infrared light which may be provided by a structured infrared light emitter 503c.  As discussed below, the structured infrared light emitter may be configured to emit pulses of infrared light that may be imaged by the infrared camera 503b,
with the time of received pixels being recorded and used to determine distances to image elements using time-of-flight calculations.  Collectively, the stereo RGB camera 503a, the infrared camera 503b and the infrared emitter 503c may be referred to as
an RGB-D (D for distance) camera 503.
<br/><br/> The scene manager module 510 may scan the distance measurements and images provided by the scene sensor 500 in order to produce a three-dimensional reconstruction of the objects within the image, including distance from the stereo cameras and
surface orientation information.  In an embodiment, the scene sensor 500, and more particularly an RGB-D camera 503, may point in a direction aligned with the field of view of the user and the head mounted device 400.  The scene sensor 500 may provide a
full body three-dimensional motion capture and gesture recognition.  The scene sensor 500 may have an infrared light emitter 503c combined with an infrared camera 503c, such as a monochrome CMOS sensor.  The scene sensor 500 may further include stereo
cameras 503a that capture three-dimensional video data.  The scene sensor 500 may work in ambient light, sunlight or total darkness and may include an RGB-D camera as described herein.  The scene sensor 500 may include a near-infrared (NIR) pulse
illumination component, as well as an image sensor with a fast gating mechanism.  Pulse signals may be collected for each pixel and correspond to locations from which the pulse may be reflected and can be used to calculate the distance to a corresponding
point on the captured subject.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the scene sensor 500 may use other distance measuring technologies (i.e., different types of distance sensors) to capture the distance of the objects within the image, for example, ultrasound echo-location, radar,
triangulation of stereoscopic images, etc. As discussed above, in an embodiment, the scene sensor 500 may include a ranging camera, a flash light detection and ranging (LIDAR) camera, a time-of-flight (ToF) camera, and/or a RGB-D camera 503, which may
determine distances to objects using at least one of range-gated ToF sensing, RF-modulated ToF sensing, pulsed-light ToF sensing, and projected-light stereo sensing.  In another embodiment, the scene sensor 500 may use a stereo camera 503a to capture
stereo images of a scene, and determine distance based on a brightness of the captured pixels contained within the image.  As mentioned above, for consistency one or more of these types of distance measuring sensors and techniques are referred to herein
generally as "distance sensors." Multiple scene sensors of differing capabilities and resolution may be present to aid in the mapping of the physical environment, accurate tracking of the user's position within the environment, and accurate tracking of
the user's view of the environment.
<br/><br/> The head mounted device 400 may also include an audio sensor 505 such as a microphone or microphone array.  An audio sensor 505 enables the head mounted device 400 to record audio, and conduct acoustic source localization and ambient noise
suppression.  The audio sensor 505 may capture audio and convert the audio signals to audio digital data.  A processor associated with the control system may review the audio digital data and apply a speech recognition algorithm to convert the data to
searchable text data.  The processor may also review the generated text data for certain recognized commands or keywords and use recognized commands or keywords as input commands to execute one or more tasks.  For example, a user may speak a command such
as "anchor virtual object" to anchor the displayed virtual object on a selected surface.  For example, the user may speak "close application" to close an application displayed on the display.
<br/><br/> The head mounted device 400 may also include a display 540.  The display 540 may display images obtained by the camera within the scene sensor 500 or generated by a processor within or coupled to the head mounted device 400.  In an embodiment,
the display 540 may be a micro display.  The display 540 may be a fully occluded display.  In another embodiment, the display 540 may be a semitransparent display that can display images on a screen that the user can see through to view the surrounding
of the environment.  The display 540 may be configured in a monocular or stereo (i.e., binocular) configuration.  Alternatively, the head mounted display 400 may be a helmet mounted display device, worn on the head, or as part of a helmet, which may have
a small display 540 optic in front of one eye (monocular) or in front of both eyes (i.e., a binocular or stereo display).  Alternatively, the head mounted device 400 may also include two display units 540 that are miniaturized and may be anyone or more
of cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), liquid crystal on silicon (LCos) displays, organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays, Mirasol displays based on Interferometric Modulator (IMOD) elements which are simple
micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) devices, light guide displays and wave guide displays, and other display technologies that exist and that may be developed.  In another embodiment, the display 540 may comprise multiple micro-displays 540 to
increase total overall resolution and increase a field of view.
<br/><br/> The head mounted device 400 may also include an audio output device 550, which may be a headphone and/or speaker collectively shown as reference numeral 550 to output audio.  The head mounted device 400 may also include one or more processors
that can provide control functions to the head mounted device 400 as well as generate images, such as user interface windows as described below in association with FIG. 6.  For example, the head mounted device 400 may include a core processor, an
applications processor, a graphics processor and a navigation processor.  Alternatively, the head mounted display 400 may be coupled to a separate processor, such as the processor in a smart phone or other mobile computing device.  Video/audio output may
be processed by the processor or by a mobile CPU, which is connected (via a wire or a wireless network) to the head mounted device 400.  The head mounted device 400 may also include a scene manager block 510, a user control block 515, a surface manager
block 520, an audio manager block 525 and an information access block 530, which may be separate circuit modules or implemented within the processor as software modules.  The head mounted device 400 may further include a local memory and a wireless or
wired interface for communicating with other devices or a local wireless or wired network in order to receive digital data from a remote memory 555.  Using a remote memory 555 in the system may enable the head mounted device 400 to be made more
lightweight by reducing memory chips and circuit boards in the device.
<br/><br/> The scene manager block 510 of the controller may receive data from the scene sensor 500 and construct the virtual representation of the physical environment.  For example, a laser may be used to emit laser light that is reflected from objects
in a room and captured in a camera, with the round trip time of the light used to calculate distances to various objects and surfaces in the room.  Such distance measurements may be used to determine the location, size and shape of objects in the room
and to generate a map of the scene.  After a map is formulated, the scene manager block 510 may link the map to other generated maps to form a larger map of a predetermined area.  In an embodiment, the scene and distance data may be transmitted to a
server or other computing device which may generate an amalgamated or integrated map based on the image, distance and map data received from a number of head mounted devices (and over time as the user moved about within the scene).  Such an integrated
map data made available via wireless data links to the head mounted device processors.  The other maps may be maps scanned by the instant device or by other head mounted devices, or may be received from a cloud service.  The scene manager 510 may
identify surfaces and track the current position of the user based on data from the scene sensors 500.  The user control block 515 may gather user control inputs to the system, for example audio commands, gestures, and input devices (e.g., keyboard,
mouse).  In an embodiment, the user control block 515 may include or be configured to access a gesture dictionary to interpret user body part movements identified by the scene manager 510.  Note that a gesture dictionary may store movement data or
patterns for recognizing gestures that may include pokes, pats, taps, pushes, guiding, flicks, turning, rotating, grabbing and pulling, two hands with palms open for panning images, drawing (e.g., finger painting), forming shapes with fingers (e.g., an
"OK" sign), and swipes, all of which may be accomplished on or in close proximity to the apparent location of a virtual object in a generated display.  The user control block 515 may also recognize compound commands.  This may include two or more
commands.  For example, a gesture and a sound (e.g. clapping) or a voice control command (e.g. "OK" detected hand gesture made and combined with a voice command or a spoken word to confirm an operation).  When a user control 515 is identified, the
controller may provide a request to another subcomponent of the head mounted device 400.
<br/><br/> The head mounted device 400 may also include a surface manager block 520.  The surface manager block 520 may continuously track the positions of surfaces within the scene based on captured images (as managed by the scene manager block 510) and
measurements from distance sensors.  The surface manager block 520 may also continuously update positions of the virtual objects that may be anchored on surfaces within the captured image.  The surface manager block 520 may be responsible for active
surfaces and user interface windows.  The audio manager block 525 may provide control instructions for audio input and audio output.  The audio manager block 525 may construct an audio stream delivered to the headphones and speakers 550.
<br/><br/> The information access block 530 may provide control instructions to mediate access to the digital information.  Data may be stored on a local memory storage medium on the head mounted device 400.  Data may also be stored on a remote data
storage medium 555 on accessible digital devices, or data may be stored on a distributed cloud storage memory, which is accessible by the head mounted device 400.  The information access block 530 communicates with a data store 555, which may be a
memory, a disk, a remote memory, a cloud computing resource, or an integrated memory 555.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary user interface for an augmented reality enabled device according to some aspects of the present disclosure.  As shown in FIG. 6, the user interface can be configured to effectively fuse real world objects and AR
contents.  In one exemplary implementation, the ARD scans an environment using a front facing camera.  In one approach, the Qualcomm Vuforia.TM.  computer vision application may be used to detect flat surfaces.  As shown in FIG. 6, the flat surfaces may
include surfaces in top, bottom, left, right, and front view of the user, and the environment may include real world objects, such as table 602, window 604, painting 606, and lamp 608.  User interface windows, for example 610, 612, 614, 616, 618, 620,
622, and 624 may then be placed to the flat surfaces for displaying augmented reality contents, such as email, PowerPoint presentations, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> tweets, movies, etc.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, if the number of augmented reality contents may be more than the number of user interface windows identified, the ARD may be configured to prioritize and prune the number of augmented reality contents to be displayed. 
In some other implementations, the ARD may be configured to merge or split the flat surfaces detected to form different sets of user interface windows to match the augmented reality contents to be displayed.
<br/><br/> According to embodiments of the present disclosure, the ARD may be configured to prioritize the flat surfaces detected based on the following criteria, including but not limited to: a) how well features of user interface windows can be tracked;
b) area/size of a surface; c) location of the surfaces relative to the user's field of view (FOV); 4) orientation and aspect ratio of the surfaces; and 5) background color of the surfaces.  In some implementations, if a surface has many colors and has
high frequency variations, a set of markers may be chosen such that the virtual user interface window(s) may "stick" to the surface even though the user moves his head from one view to another view.  In addition, in situations when a user is conversing
with a person, surfaces in the periphery may be preferred to surfaces in the center so that the user interface windows would not interfere with the user's conversation with the person.  In some applications, large areas may be preferred over small areas.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, depending on the content to be displayed, a surface having a vertical orientation may be preferred to a display a Word document, while a surface having a horizontal orientation may be preferred to display a movie. 
Furthermore, aspect ratio of each user interface window can be used as criteria in matching augmented reality contents to be displayed to user interface windows.  For example, a long and narrow horizontal user interface window can be used to display a
stock ticker, while a user interface window having approximate aspect ratio of 16:9 or 4:3 may be used to display movies.
<br/><br/> In other implementations, background color of a surface (e.g., a wall) can be used as criteria in matching augmented reality contents to be displayed in the user interface windows.  For example, a wall with gray wallpaper may be preferred over a
plain white wall, as the augmented reality content displayed over a gray surface may have greater contrast than a plain white wall which reflects lights from the windows or from other light sources in the environment.
<br/><br/> According to aspects of the present disclosure, after the surfaces to be used as backdrops have been prioritized, the user interface windows may then be characterized for display.  The user interface windows are provided with attributes based on
the following criteria, including but not limited to: a) importance of certain content to the user; b) the amount of contents to be displayed; and c) viewing orientation and aspect ratio of the content to be displayed.
<br/><br/> The ARD may then assigns user interface windows to surfaces based on the criteria described above.  For example, a higher priority user interface window with lots of contents may be put in a high priority surface that has a large area.  The ARD
may be configured to track whether a surface has been moved in the frames captured by the front facing camera because the user has moved his head, or if the actual surface (e.g., side of a bus) has been moved.  This determination is made based on using
one or more six degrees of freedom sensors (e.g. accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope) in the ARD.  For example, if the user's head has remained still while the surface has moved, then that surface may be pruned, and user interface windows may be
reassigned.  According to aspects of the present disclosure, in one approach, the ARD may be configured to track the available surfaces in the environment using the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) technique with images captured by a camera of
the ARD.  In another approach, the ARD may be configured to track the available surfaces in the environment using the random sample consensus (RANSAC) technique with images captured by the camera of the ARD.  In yet another approach, the ARD may be
configured to track the surfaces in the environment using non-visual methods, such as using radio frequency identifications (RFIDs) available in the environment.
<br/><br/> According to some aspects of the present disclosure, virtual objects within a scene, such as on an anchor surface may be tracked and rendered continuously so that the virtual objects may appear stationary even as the user turns her head and
moves about.  As mentioned above, the process of orienting the ARD (e.g. a head mounted device) with respect to the surroundings, and determining distances to and relative orientation of various surfaces may be accomplished continuously by monitoring
orientation sensors (e.g., accelerometers and gyroscopes) and triangulating position and angle of view of the device as it moves in space by constantly referencing shifts in the topography of the scanned three-dimensional (3D) environment, thus
performing Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) operations.
<br/><br/> Using the methods described above, as shown in FIG. 6, user interface window 610 may describe an area on the ground in landscape mode having a size of 120 square feet with relatively low priority and relatively low trackability.  User interface
window 612 may describe an area on the right wall in portrait mode having a size of 70 square feet with relatively medium priority and relatively high trackability.  User interface window 614 may describe an area on the right wall in portrait mode having
a size of 100 square feet with relatively medium priority and relatively high trackability.  User interface window 616 may describe an area on the ceiling in landscape mode having a size of 100 square feet with relatively low priority and relatively low
trackability.  User interface window 618 may describe an area on the front wall in landscape mode having a size of 80 square feet with relatively high priority and relatively high trackability.  User interface window 620 may describe an area on the left
wall in landscape mode having a size of 50 square feet with relatively high priority and relatively high trackability.  User interface window 622 may describe an area on the left wall in portrait mode having a size of 100 square feet with relatively
medium priority and relatively high trackability.  User interface window 624 may describe an area on the left wall in landscape mode having a size of 50 square feet with relatively medium priority and relatively high trackability.
<br/><br/> After the ARD has identified flat surfaces in the environment, it may assign the AR windows to the flat surfaces, in order of their respective priorities.  For example, a Word document the user was last working on his personal computer prior to
his meeting may have a higher priority and may be placed on the wall in front of him in the meeting room.  According to aspects of the present disclosure, the ARD may consider the size of an AR window to ensure it matches to the AR content to be
displayed.  For example, the size of an AR window may be enlarged if the font in a document to be displayed may be too small and hard to read.  On the other hand, the size of the AR window may be reduced if the size of the AR window may be too big for
the document and uncomfortable for the user's eyes.  In some implementations, the ARD may apply a set of scaling factors that can be used to stretch or shrink an AR window.  In one approach, a minimum scaling factor and a maximum scaling factor, such as
resize_min and resize_max, may be used to adjust the size of an AR window.  For example, typical values for displaying an document may range from 0.5 (50%) for resize_min and 3.0 (300%) for resize_max based on a predetermined AR window size, such as
640.times.480 VGA.  For another example, the resize_min and resize_max for a movie to be played from an Netflix application may be 0.5 (50%) and 10.0 (1,000%) respectively, indicating the movie can be resized much larger than documents.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, based on the size an AR window can be displayed on a given surface, determinations may be made to split a flat surface to support two or more AR windows.  According to aspects of the present disclosure, a surface
allocated to a first AR window may further be split into multiple AR windows if the AR contents to be displayed in the first AR window may not use the entire available surface.  On the other hand, multiple AR windows may be merged to form a new AR window
if the AR contents to be displayed require a larger displaying surface.
<br/><br/> In some other implementations, the prioritization and assignment of AR contents to AR windows may be determined by the logical relationships among the AR contents to be displayed.  The ARD may be configured to display multiple logically related
AR contents in two or more AR windows near each other.  For example, the ARD may be configured to use an AR window to display a document explaining a scientific theory and use an adjacent AR window to display a video showing a demonstration of the
scientific theory.  For another example, the ARD may be configured to use an AR window to display a paper to be published in a conference and use an adjacent AR window to display the presentation slides the author may use to present the paper in the
conference.
<br/><br/> With the user interface described above, users can interact with their surroundings more naturally while reading augmented reality content from the user interface windows established, because these user interface windows are not just placed in
front of them.  Instead, they are placed to be better fused into the natural scene in the environment according to aspects of the present disclosure.  Thus, the disclosed user interface may be applied to improve efficiency and productivity for the users.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary method of displaying augmented reality contents according to some aspects of the present disclosure.  In block 702, the processor 122 and/or augmented reality user interface module 134 can be configured to control

augmented reality contents for display in response to a determination of the user being at home, select a third set of augmented reality contents for display in response to a determination of the user being in a business meeting, or select a fourth set
of augmented reality contents for display in response to a determination of the user being in a social event.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, the first set of augmented reality contents includes application programs for communication and documentation the user is accustomed to use at work, and the second set of augmented reality contents includes application
programs for communication and entertainment the user is accustomed to use at home.  In addition, the first set of augmented reality contents for communication and documentation includes email, web browser, and office productivity applications, and the
