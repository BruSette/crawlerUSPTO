to as the print application server), a first client 16, and a second client 18.  The exemplary environment 10 includes a first printer 20 interconnected via the network 24, and/or a second printer 22 that connects directly to the second client 18 via a
cable or wireless or other means, without connecting to the network 24.
<br/><br/> The SNS server 12 and print application server 14 represent generally any computing devices capable of serving requested content to a first client 16, second client 18 or first printer 20 via network 24, or to second printer 22 via a proxy run
on second client 18.  The term content refers to visual and audible information that can be presented to a user of first client 16, second client 18, first printer 20 or second printer 22.  Examples include text, still, images, audio, and video.  Content
can also include instructions designed to be processed by a first client 16, second client 18, first printer 20 or second printer 22.  Examples include HTML code and various scripts.  The term proxy includes a memory resident software application that
receives from a network messages intended for a printer and sends the messages on to the printer, and that receives messages from the printer and sends the messages via the network to another computing device.
<br/><br/> The SNS server is a server hosted by a social networking service.  As used in this specification and the appended claims, a "social networking service" includes any online or web based service that facilitates the sharing of information and the
establishing of online relationships by digitally mapping a member's real-world social connections, and make relationship recommendations based on trust.  Examples of such social networking services are <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> MySpace, Twitter, Bebo, Orkut, and
LinkedIn.  In an example, a social networking service may utilize the SNS server to host a web page, to facilitate communication via email or instant messaging, and/or to make third party applications.
<br/><br/> In an exemplary social networking service, a first individual may send an invitation to a second individual to be a friend.  As used in this specification and the appended claims, a "friend" indicates a fellow member of a social networking
service that has been given special rights or access based on a trust relationship.  Such trust may be based on prior real-world or online experiences with that fellow member, or may be granted indiscriminately.  Some social networking services use the
word "friend" to designate a trust relationship, and others may use other words to demonstrate an online relationship.  For example, LinkedIn may refer to a "connection", Twitter may refer to a "follower" and Classmates.com may refer to a "classmate" to
indicate a trust relationship.  As used in this specification and the appended claims, "friend" includes these and any other designations of trust utilized by these and other social networking services.  In an embodiment, a social networking service may
have multiple trust relationships, all of which may be considered equivalent to a "friend" for purposes of this specification and the appended claims.  If the second individual accepts the invitation and agrees to be a friend of the first individual, a
friend relationship is established.  This friend relationship may enable the first individual to view some or all of the content of the second individual's personal page (e.g. status postings, pictures, and lists of other friends) and vice versa.  Social
networking services may provide a variety of ways for "friends" to interact, e.g. e-mail, instant messaging accessing each other's personal web pages.
<br/><br/> First client 16 and second client 18 represent generally any computing devices capable of receiving content from and communicating with SNS server 12 or print application server 14 via network 24.  First client 16 and second client 18 are also
responsible for receiving and processing responses to the requests.  Processing can include displaying visual content such as text, images, and motion video on a display device as well as broadcasting audio content via one or more speakers.  As used in
this Detailed Description of Embodiments, "first user" includes, but is not limited to, a user that utilizes a computing device to communicate with the SNS server 12 and the print application server 14 via the network 24.  As used in this Detailed
Description of Embodiments, "second user" includes, but is not limited to, a user other than the first user that utilizes a computing device to communicate with the SNS server and the print application server 14 via the network 24.  These examples of a
"first user" and a "second user" set forth in this paragraph are non-limiting examples.  Other embodiments are possible and nothing in the accompanying drawings or in this Detailed Description of Embodiments relating to a "first user", "second user",
"first client" or "second client" should be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure, which is defined in the Claims.
<br/><br/> First printer 20 represents generally any printing device capable of sending requests to, and receiving requests and receiving content from, SNS server 12, or print application server 14 via network 24.  First printer 20 is responsible for

<br/><br/> Print service 40 represents in combination with web server 42 generally any programming that, when executed, implements the functionality of sharer 26 of FIG. 2.  In particular, print service 40 in combination with web server 42, when executed
by processor 36, is responsible for receiving, via a network, from a first user that is a member of a social networking service an instruction to share a printer.  In doing so, print service 40 in combination with web server 42 may receive, via the
network, from the first user an address associated with the printer, and capabilities of the printer.  The print service 40 in combination with web server 42 may send, via the network, to a second user that is a member of the social networking service
information that the printer is available for sharing by the second user.  The print service 40 in combination with web server 42 receives, via the network, from the second user a print job, and renders the print job to a format that is compatible with
the printer according to the capabilities.  After confirming that the first user identified the second user as a friend within the social networking service, the print service 40 in combination with web server 42 sends, via the network, the print job to
the printer at the address to print.
<br/><br/>OPERATION
<br/><br/> FIGS. 4-5 are exemplary flow diagrams depicting exemplary embodiments of a method to share a printer and print.  In discussing FIGS. 4-5, reference may be made to the diagrams of FIGS. 1-3 to provide contextual examples.  Implementation,
however, is not limited to those examples.
<br/><br/> Starting with FIG. 4, an instruction to share a printer is received at a print service, via a network, from a first user that is a member of a social networking service (block 46).  Referring back to FIG. 2, catalog engine 28 may be responsible
for implementing block 46.  In an embodiment the instruction may be received from a first user that sent the instruction via the front panel of the printer.  In an embodiment the instruction may be received from a first user that sent the instruction via
a proxy operating on a computer that attaches to the printer to be shared.  In an embodiment the instruction may be received from a first user that sent the instruction via a web browser accessing a social networking service server.  In an embodiment the
instruction may be accompanied by a login password or other information that identifies the first user as a member of the social networking service.  In an embodiment the instruction may be accompanied by information that the printer is available for all
friends or a subset of all friends of the first user.  In an embodiment the instruction may be accompanied by information that the printer is available for a single friend of the first user.
<br/><br/> Continuing with the flow diagram of FIG. 4, a print job is received at the print service, via the network, from a second user that is a member of the social networking service (block 48).  Referring back to FIG. 2, job receipt engine 30 may be
responsible for implementing block 48.  In an embodiment, a request from the second user to find shared printers available to the second user for sharing may also be received by the print service, via the network.
<br/><br/> Continuing with the flow diagram of FIG. 4, the print job is sent, via the network, to the printer to print (block 50).  Referring back to FIG. 2, job send engine 32 may be responsible for implementing block 50.  In an embodiment, the print
service may receive a message from the printer, or from a proxy running on a computing device that electronically connects to the printer, a message requesting a print task.  In an embodiment, the print job may be sent to a printer that connects directly
with a print application server that runs the print service.
<br/><br/> Moving on to FIG. 5, in a particular implementation, an instruction to share a printer is received at a print service, via a network, from a first user that is a member of a social networking service (block 52).  Referring back to FIG. 2, the
catalog engine 28 may be responsible for implementing block 52.
<br/><br/> Continuing with the flow diagram of FIG. 5, an address associated with the printer is received at the print service, via the network, from the first user (block 54).  Referring back to FIG. 2, the catalog engine 28 may be responsible for
implementing block 54.  In an embodiment, the address may be in the form of an IP address, a domain name, an email address, a printer serial number, a printer MAC address, or other unique identifier.  Continuing with the flow diagram of FIG. 5,
capabilities of the printer are received at the print service, via the network from the first user (block 56).  Referring back to FIG. 2, the catalog engine 28 may be responsible for implementing block 56.  In an embodiment, the address and capabilities
are stored in a database that includes the following information regarding each printer made available for sharing: the name of the sharing user, the social networking service through which sharing is being allowed, social networking service
identification information, a printer address, and printer capabilities.
<br/><br/> Continuing with the flow diagram of FIG. 5, information that the printer is available for sharing is sent, via the network, to a second user that is a member of the social networking service (block 58).  Referring back to FIG. 2, the job receipt
engine 30 may be responsible for implementing block 58.  In an embodiment, the information regarding the availability of the printer may sent in the form of a list of printers that are available for sharing by the second user, which list may be sorted by
the distance from the second user, the printer or restrictions that the first user may have placed on the second user's use of the shared printer.
<br/><br/> Continuing with the flow diagram of FIG. 5, a print job is received at the print service, via the network, from the second user (block 60).  Referring back to FIG. 2, the job receipt engine 30 may be responsible for implementing block 60.  In an
embodiment the print service is capable of receiving the print job via an email address, via browser upload, or via printer driver upload.  In one embodiment, the print service may make available to the second user an email address, a web link that
enables upload via the second user's browser, and/or a web link that the second user may access to download a printer driver, which printer driver can be used by the second user to send the print job to the print service.
<br/><br/> Continuing with the flow diagram of FIG. 5, the print job is rendered to a format that is compatible with the printer according to the capabilities (block 62).  Referring back to FIG. 2, the job send engine 32 may be responsible for implementing
block 62.  In an example, rendering may include taking a print job from a native format that is not understood by the printer and converting that document and its fonts to a format or language that can be understood by the printer (e.g. PCL3, postscript,
.pdf, and .jpg).  If a portion of the print job is already in a format that is understood by the printer and another portion is in a format that is not understood by the printer, rendering may include converting those portions of the print job that
cannot be understood by the printer.
<br/><br/> Continuing with the flow diagram of FIG. 5, the print job is sent, via the network, to the printer at the address to print upon confirmation that the second user is identified as a friend of the first user within the social networking service
(block 64).  Referring back to FIG. 2, the job send engine 32 may be responsible for implementing block 64.  In an embodiment that print service may communicate with the SNS before sending each print job to confirm that the second user is identified as a
friend of the first user within the social networking service.  In an embodiment, the print service may communicate on a periodic basis with the SNS to obtain information regarding friend status of one or more users, and store the friend status
information in memory for ready access by the print service that may increase the speed of printing to a shared printer.  In an embodiment, sending the print job may include sending the print job to a print job queue that is identified by a printer
address.  The print job may in turn be sent to the printer upon receipt of a message from the printer requesting print jobs for that printer address.
<br/><br/>EXAMPLE
<br/><br/> FIGS. 6-9 depict screen shots of user interfaces, according to embodiments.  FIG. 6 is a screen shot of a user interface 66 that, in an embodiment, may be presented to a first user that has indicated a desire to share a printer.  In an
embodiment the user interface 66 might be presented to the first user by the print service via a browser window, the browser window to appear on a web page that is provided by a social network service.  In this example, the user interface 66 invites the
first user to share first user's printer by following share instructions on the front panel of the printer to be shared, or alternatively to enable sharing via a proxy that the first user can download from the print service.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a screen shot of a user interface 68 that, in an embodiment, may be presented to a first user that has indicated a desire to share a printer.  In an embodiment the user interface 68 might be provided to the first user by the print
service via a browser window, the browser window to appear on a web page that is provided by a social network service.  In an embodiment the user interface 68 might be presented to the first user by a printer proxy running on a computing device.  In an
embodiment the print service will not proceed with the first user's instruction to share a printer unless the first user provides a social network service login identification and password.  In an embodiment, the print service will not proceed with the
first user's instruction to discontinue sharing of a printer unless the first user provides the social network service login identification and password.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 is a screen shot of a user interface 70 that, in an embodiment, may be presented to a second user that has indicated a desire to print to a shared printer.  In an embodiment the user interface 70 might be provided to the second user by
the print service via a browser window, the browser window to appear on a web page that is provided by a social network service.  In this example, the user interface 70 provides the second user with a list of printers of friends that have made printers
available for sharing by the second user.  In this example, the user interface 70 provided the second user with information regarding the distance to the printer and the printer type, and invites the second user to select a printer from the available
list.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a screen shot of a user interface 72 that, in an embodiment, may be presented to a second user that has selected a printer that is has been made available for sharing by the second user, and that is ready to send a print job.  In an
embodiment the user interface 72 might be provided to the second user by the print service via a browser window, the browser window to appear on a web page that is provided by a social network service.  In this example the user interface 72 provides the
second user with a choice of sending a print job to the print service in three different ways: by email, by file upload, or via a printer driver.  In this example if the second user chooses to send the print job via email, the print job is attached to an
email and sent to the print service via email.  In this example if the second user chooses to send the print job via file upload, the print job is sent to the print service via the HTTP protocol.  In this example if the second user chooses to send the
print job via printer driver, a printer driver is downloaded to the second user's computing device from the print service, and the print job is sent to the print service via operation of the printer driver application.
