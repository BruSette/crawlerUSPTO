       <p> Systems and methods of the present disclosure are directed to providing a
     digital reputation score. The server can generate a first reputation
     score of a user based on the user's online activity, identity
     verification, and online transaction history. The server can identify,
     from the user's online account, a first set of online accounts with which
     the user established a unidirectional trust relationship from the user to
     the first set of online accounts. The server can identify, from the
     user's online account, a second set of online accounts with which the
     user established a unidirectional trust relationship from the user to the
     second set of online accounts. The server can generate a second
     reputation score based on the first number and second number of trust
     relationships from the first set and second set of online accounts
     respectively. The server can generate a third reputation using the first
     and second reputation scores.

<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method of generating a digital reputation score, comprising: generating, by a server, a first reputation score of a first user based on online activity associated with
the first user, identity verification of the first user and online transaction history of the first user;  receiving, by the server, a first plurality of requests from a first online account of the first user to establish unidirectional trust
relationships with a first set of online accounts corresponding to a first set of users, the first online account and the first set of online accounts maintained by the server;  establishing, by the server, responsive to receiving the plurality of
requests from the first online account, for the first online account, a unidirectional trust relationship from the first online account to each of the first set of online accounts;  receiving, by the server, a second plurality of requests from a second
set of online accounts corresponding to a second set of users to establish unidirectional trust relationships with the first online account corresponding to the first user, the second set of online accounts maintained by the server;  establishing, by the
server, responsive to receiving the second plurality of requests from the second set of online accounts, for the first online account, a plurality of unidirectional trust relationships from the second set of online accounts to the first online account,
each of the unidirectional trust relationships from the second set of online accounts to the first online account established from a respective online account of the second set of online accounts to the first online account;  generating, by the server,
for the first online account of the first user, a second reputation score based on a first number of unidirectional trust relationships established from the first online account to each of the first set of online accounts and a second number of
unidirectional trust relationships established from the second set of online accounts to the first online account;  generating, by the server, for the first online account of the first user, a third reputation score using the first reputation score of
the first user and the second reputation score of the first user;  identifying, by the server, from the second set of online accounts, a second online account corresponding to a second user that is included in the second set of online accounts; 
generating, by the server, for the second online account of the second user, a fourth reputation score based on i) online activity associated with the second user, ii) identity verification of the second user, and iii) online transaction history of the
second user;  generating, by the server, for the second online account of the second user, the fifth reputation score based on i) a third number of unidirectional trust relationships established from the second online account to each of a third set of
online accounts and ii) a fourth number of unidirectional trust relationships established from a fourth set of online accounts to the second online account, the third set of online accounts including the first online account corresponding to the first
user;  generating, by the server, for the second online account of the second user, a sixth reputation score of the second user based on the fourth reputation score and the fifth reputation score;  receiving, by the server, an update on at least one of
the online activity associated with the first user, the identity verification of the first user or the online transaction history of the first user;  adjusting, by the server, the first reputation score and the third reputation score of the first user
responsive to receiving the update;  and adjusting, by the server, responsive to adjusting the third reputation score of the first user, the fourth reputation score of the second user based on the unidirectional trust relationship from the second online
account to the first online account.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, wherein generating the first reputation score includes: identifying, by the server, one or more other accounts maintained by one or more other servers;  determining, using information associated with the one or more

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
<br/><br/> The present solution is generally directed to providing a reputation score.  In particular, the present solution generates a reputation score based on unidirectional trust relationships among online accounts.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
<br/><br/> In the recent past, people have created online identities by establishing social networking profiles, email addresses, among other online accounts.  These online accounts are easy to establish.  Some people may create online accounts to
participate in activities and transactions that they would otherwise not participate in if their real-world identity was associated.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
<br/><br/> Systems and methods of the present solution are directed to providing a reputation score.  In some embodiments, the present solution can determine a total reputation score based on: (1) an intrinsic reputation score and (2) a network reputation
score.  The intrinsic reputation score may be based on the reputation from the user himself or herself.  There may be three factors that are taken into account for the intrinsic reputation score: (i) online activity, (ii) identity, and (iii)
transactions.  Online activity may include the duration of the user's online presence and the number of other users that the user is associated with.  Identity may include the identity of the user as inferred, for example, from the user's email address,
government-issued identification, or phone verification, among others.  Transactions may include reviews and ratings associated with online transaction made by the user.  The intrinsic reputation score and the three factors thereof may take into account
temporal component.  For example, the value of the intrinsic reputation score determined from transactions may decrease after the user conducts fraudulent transactions.  In another example, the value of the intrinsic reputation score may decrease over
time based on a negative exponential function.
<br/><br/> Network reputation score may be based on the trust relationship between the user and other entities.  Network reputation score may be determined based on reputation increases and reputation decreases.  Reputation increases may signify the gain
to network reputation based on the number of trusters that the user is associated with.  Reputation decreases, on the other hand, may signify the risk of a user in trusting another user, and may be based on the number of people that the user trusts and
may depend on time.  For example, if a user trusts another user and afterward the other user receives a poor review on a transaction, the network reputation of the first user may also be reduced.  The total reputation score may be based on the intrinsic
reputation score and the network reputation score.  For example, the total reputation score may be a sum of the intrinsic reputation score and the network reputation score.
<br/><br/> At least one aspect of the present solution is directed to a method of generating a digital reputation score.  The method can be performed or executed by a server having one or more processors.  The server can generate a first reputation score
of a user based on online activity associated with the user, identity verification of the user and online transaction history of the user.  The server can identify, from a first online account of the user of a plurality of online accounts maintained by
the server, a first set of online accounts of the plurality of online accounts with which the first online account established, responsive to one or more first requests received by the server, a unidirectional trust relationship from the first online
account to each respective online account of the first set of online accounts.  The server can identify, from the first online account of the first user, a second set of online accounts that have established, via the server, responsive to one or more
second requests received by the server, unidirectional trust relationships from each respective online account of the second set of online accounts to the first online account.  The server can generate, for the first online account of the user, a second
reputation score based on a first number of trust relationships established with the first set of online accounts and a second number of trust relationships established with the second set of online accounts.  The server can generate, for the first
online account of the user, a third reputation score using the first reputation score of the user and the second reputation score of the user.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include identifying one or more other accounts maintained by one or more other server and determining, using information associated with the one or more other accounts, a first
component score used to generate the first reputation score.  In some embodiments, determining, using information associated with the one or more other accounts, the first component score used to generate the first reputation score can include
determining a length of time for which the one or more of the other accounts have been established and determining a number of online accounts with which each of the one or more other accounts has interacted.  In some embodiments, generating the first
component score can include applying a slow increasing function to the determined length of time or the number of online actions with which an online account has interacted to counter-measure high variance in the determined length of time or the number
of online actions across different online accounts.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include identifying a domain name of an email address provided by the user.  In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include determining that the domain name
belongs to an entity that satisfies a predetermined criteria.  In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include responsive to determining that the domain name belongs to an entity that satisfies a predetermined criteria, generating
a second component score used to generate the first reputation score.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include receiving a first image of a government-issued ID of the user that includes the user's face.  In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include
identifying, from the government-issued ID, data representative of the face of the user.  In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include receiving, via a video file, a second image including the face of the user.  In some
embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include comparing features of the user's face from the first image to features of the face of the user included in the second image.  In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can
include increasing a value of a second component score responsive to determining that the user's face included in the first image matches the face of the user in the second image.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include receiving, via one or more networks, data corresponding to online accounts of the users maintained by a plurality of other servers corresponding to other entities, the data
representative of one or more online transactions performed by the user.  In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include determining, using the received data, a third component score to generate the first reputation score.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the server can determine, for each of the first set of online accounts and the second set of online accounts, a respective second reputation score.  In some embodiments, the server can determine the second reputation score
of the first online account using the second reputation scores of each of the first set of online accounts and the second set of online accounts.  In some embodiments, the second reputation score of each of the first set of online accounts and the second
set of online accounts can be weighted according to a function of time.  In some embodiments, the server can update the third reputation score responsive to determining that a second reputation score of an online account of the first set of online
accounts has decreased.
<br/><br/> At least one aspect of the present solution is directed to a system of generating a digital reputation score.  The system can include a server maintaining a plurality of online accounts in a database.  The server can be configured to generate a
first reputation score of a user based on online activity associated with the user, identity verification of the user and online transaction history of the user.  The server can be configured to identify from a first online account of the user of the
plurality of online accounts, a first set of online accounts of the plurality of online accounts with which the first online account, established, responsive to one or more first requests received by the server, a unidirectional trust relationship from
the first online account to each respective online account of the first set of online accounts.  The server can be configured to identify, from the first online account of the first user, a second set of online accounts that have established, via the
server, responsive to one or more second requests received by the server, unidirectional trust relationships from each respective online account of the second set of online accounts to the first online account.  The server can be configured to generate,
for the first online account of the user, a second reputation score based on a first number of trust relationships established with the first set of online accounts and a second number of trust relationships established with the second set of online
accounts.  The server can be configured to generate, for the first online account of the user, a third reputation score using the first reputation score of the user and the second reputation score of the user.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include identifying or more other accounts maintained by one or more other server and determining, using information associated with the one or more other accounts, a first component
score used to generate the first reputation score.  In some embodiments, determining, using information associated with the one or more other accounts, a first component score used to generate the first reputation score can include determining a length
of time for which the one or more of the other accounts have been established and determining a number of online accounts with which each of the one or more other accounts has interacted.  In some embodiments, generating the first component score can
include applying a slow increasing function to the determined length of time or the number of online actions with which an online account has interacted to counter-measure high variance in the determined length of time or the number of online actions
across different online accounts.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include identifying a domain name of an email address provided by the user.  In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include determining that the domain name
belongs to an entity that satisfies a predetermined criteria.  In some embodiments, generating the first reputation score can include responsive to determining that the domain name belongs to an entity that satisfies a predetermined criteria, generating

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> For purposes of reading the description of the various embodiments below, the following descriptions of the sections of the specification and their respective contents may be helpful:
<br/><br/> Section A describes a network environment and computing environment which may be useful for practicing embodiments described herein.
<br/><br/> Section B describes embodiments of systems and methods for reputation scoring.
<br/><br/> A. Computing and Network Environment
<br/><br/> Prior to discussing specific embodiments of the present solution, it may be helpful to describe aspects of the operating environment as well as associated system components (e.g., hardware elements) in connection with the methods and systems
described herein.  Referring to FIG. 1A, an embodiment of a network environment is depicted.  In brief overview, the network environment includes one or more clients 102a-102n (also generally referred to as local machine(s) 102, client(s) 102, client
node(s) 102, client machine(s) 102, client computer(s) 102, client device(s) 102, endpoint(s) 102, or endpoint node(s) 102) in communication with one or more servers 106a-106n (also generally referred to as server(s) 106, node 106, or remote machine(s)
106) via one or more networks 104.  In some embodiments, a client 102 has the capacity to function as both a client node seeking access to resources provided by a server and as a server providing access to hosted resources for other clients 102a-102n.
<br/><br/> Although FIG. 1A shows a network 104 between the clients 102 and the servers 106, the clients 102 and the servers 106 may be on the same network 104.  In some embodiments, there are multiple networks 104 between the clients 102 and the servers
106.  In one of these embodiments, a network 104' (not shown) may be a private network and a network 104 may be a public network.  In another of these embodiments, a network 104 may be a private network and a network 104' a public network.  In still
another of these embodiments, networks 104 and 104' may both be private networks.
<br/><br/> The network 104 may be connected via wired or wireless links.  Wired links may include Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), coaxial cable lines, or optical fiber lines.  The wireless links may include BLUETOOTH, Wi-Fi, Worldwide Interoperability for
Microwave Access (WiMAX), an infrared channel or satellite band.  The wireless links may also include any cellular network standards used to communicate among mobile devices, including standards that qualify as 1G, 2G, 3G, or 4G.  The network standards
may qualify as one or more generation of mobile telecommunication standards by fulfilling a specification or standards such as the specifications maintained by International Telecommunication Union.  The 3G standards, for example, may correspond to the
International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) specification, and the 4G standards may correspond to the International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced (IMT-Advanced) specification.  Examples of cellular network standards include AMPS, GSM,
GPRS, UMTS, LTE, LTE Advanced, Mobile WiMAX, and WiMAX-Advanced.  Cellular network standards may use various channel access methods e.g. FDMA, TDMA, CDMA, or SDMA.  In some embodiments, different types of data may be transmitted via different links and
standards.  In other embodiments, the same types of data may be transmitted via different links and standards.
<br/><br/> The network 104 may be any type and/or form of network.  The geographical scope of the network 104 may vary widely and the network 104 can be a body area network (BAN), a personal area network (PAN), a local-area network (LAN), e.g. Intranet, a
metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), or the Internet.  The topology of the network 104 may be of any form and may include, e.g., any of the following: point-to-point, bus, star, ring, mesh, or tree.  The network 104 may be an
overlay network which is virtual and sits on top of one or more layers of other networks 104'.  The network 104 may be of any such network topology as known to those ordinarily skilled in the art capable of supporting the operations described herein. 
The network 104 may utilize different techniques and layers or stacks of protocols, including, e.g., the Ethernet protocol, the internet protocol suite (TCP/IP), the ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) technique, the SONET (Synchronous Optical Networking)
protocol, or the SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) protocol.  The TCP/IP internet protocol suite may include application layer, transport layer, internet layer (including, e.g., IPv6), or the link layer.  The network 104 may be a type of a broadcast
network, a telecommunications network, a data communication network, or a computer network.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the system may include multiple, logically-grouped servers 106.  In one of these embodiments, the logical group of servers may be referred to as a server farm 38 or a machine farm 38.  In another of these embodiments, the
servers 106 may be geographically dispersed.  In other embodiments, a machine farm 38 may be administered as a single entity.  In still other embodiments, the machine farm 38 includes a plurality of machine farms 38.  The servers 106 within each machine
farm 38 can be heterogeneous--one or more of the servers 106 or machines 106 can operate according to one type of operating system platform (e.g., WINDOWS NT, manufactured by Microsoft Corp.  of Redmond, Wash.), while one or more of the other servers 106
can operate on according to another type of operating system platform (e.g., Unix, Linux, or Mac OS X).
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, servers 106 in the machine farm 38 may be stored in high-density rack systems, along with associated storage systems, and located in an enterprise data center.  In this embodiment, consolidating the servers 106 in this way may
improve system manageability, data security, the physical security of the system, and system performance by locating servers 106 and high performance storage systems on localized high performance networks.  Centralizing the servers 106 and storage
systems and coupling them with advanced system management tools allows more efficient use of server resources.
<br/><br/> The servers 106 of each machine farm 38 do not need to be physically proximate to another server 106 in the same machine farm 38.  Thus, the group of servers 106 logically grouped as a machine farm 38 may be interconnected using a wide-area
network (WAN) connection or a metropolitan-area network (MAN) connection.  For example, a machine farm 38 may include servers 106 physically located in different continents or different regions of a continent, country, state, city, campus, or room.  Data
transmission speeds between servers 106 in the machine farm 38 can be increased if the servers 106 are connected using a local-area network (LAN) connection or some form of direct connection.  Additionally, a heterogeneous machine farm 38 may include one
or more servers 106 operating according to a type of operating system, while one or more other servers 106 execute one or more types of hypervisors rather than operating systems.  In these embodiments, hypervisors may be used to emulate virtual hardware,
partition physical hardware, virtualize physical hardware, and execute virtual machines that provide access to computing environments, allowing multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a host computer.  Native hypervisors may run directly on the
host computer.  Hypervisors may include VMware ESX/ESXi, manufactured by VMWare, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif.; the Xen hypervisor, an open source product whose development is overseen by Citrix Systems, Inc.; the HYPER-V hypervisors provided by Microsoft
or others.  Hosted hypervisors may run within an operating system on a second software level.  Examples of hosted hypervisors may include VMware Workstation and VIRTUALBOX.
<br/><br/> Management of the machine farm 38 may be de-centralized.  For example, one or more servers 106 may comprise components, subsystems and modules to support one or more management services for the machine farm 38.  In one of these embodiments, one
or more servers 106 provide functionality for management of dynamic data, including techniques for handling failover, data replication, and increasing the robustness of the machine farm 38.  Each server 106 may communicate with a persistent store and, in
some embodiments, with a dynamic store.
<br/><br/> Server 106 may be a file server, application server, web server, proxy server, appliance, network appliance, gateway, gateway server, virtualization server, deployment server, SSL VPN server, or firewall.  In one embodiment, the server 106 may
be referred to as a remote machine or a node.  In another embodiment, a plurality of nodes 290 may be in the path between any two communicating servers.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1B, a cloud computing environment is depicted.  A cloud computing environment may provide client 102 with one or more resources provided by a network environment.  The cloud computing environment may include one or more clients
102a-102n, in communication with the cloud 108 over one or more networks 104.  Clients 102 may include, e.g., thick clients, thin clients, and zero clients.  A thick client may provide at least some functionality even when disconnected from the cloud 108
or servers 106.  A thin client or a zero client may depend on the connection to the cloud 108 or server 106 to provide functionality.  A zero client may depend on the cloud 108 or other networks 104 or servers 106 to retrieve operating system data for
the client device.  The cloud 108 may include back end platforms, e.g., servers 106, storage, server farms or data centers.
<br/><br/> The cloud 108 may be public, private, or hybrid.  Public clouds may include public servers 106 that are maintained by third parties to the clients 102 or the owners of the clients.  The servers 106 may be located off-site in remote geographical
locations as disclosed above or otherwise.  Public clouds may be connected to the servers 106 over a public network.  Private clouds may include private servers 106 that are physically maintained by clients 102 or owners of clients.  Private clouds may
be connected to the servers 106 over a private network 104.  Hybrid clouds 108 may include both the private and public networks 104 and servers 106.
<br/><br/> The cloud 108 may also include a cloud based delivery, e.g. Software as a Service (SaaS) 110, Platform as a Service (PaaS) 112, and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 114.  IaaS may refer to a user renting the use of infrastructure resources
that are needed during a specified time period.  IaaS providers may offer storage, networking, servers or virtualization resources from large pools, allowing the users to quickly scale up by accessing more resources as needed.  Examples of IaaS can
include infrastructure and services (e.g., EG-32) provided by OVH HOSTING of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, AMAZON WEB SERVICES provided by Amazon.com, Inc., of Seattle, Wash., RACKSPACE CLOUD provided by Rackspace US, Inc., of San Antonio, Tex., Google

<br/><br/> B. Reputation Scoring System
<br/><br/> Oftentimes on the Internet, users may deal or otherwise interact with other users with whom the user may have never dealt or interacted before.  This lack of prior interaction may be a source of anxiety for such users.  A reputation scoring
system can generate a digital reputation score of users for other users to gauge how reliable the user is.  The digital reputation score may be based on two sources: (1) three-dimensional intrinsic reputation and (2) network reputation.  Briefly, the
three-dimensional intrinsic reputation can refer to the reputation a user gathers by providing information about themselves.  Such information may include, for example, email addresses, passport verifications, online accounts on social media sites,
transaction history in e-commerce, and sharing economy platforms.  Network reputation can refer to the reputation a user gathers based on activity of other users, for example, by having other users explicitly declare that they trust the user.
<br/><br/> The three-dimensional intrinsic reputation may be based on three dimensions: (i) online activity, (ii) identity, and (iii) transactions.  Online activity may be associated with a variety of factors related to digital fingerprints.  One of the
more relevant factors may be how long the user can prove that the user has been online, for instance, by connecting accounts in major, well-known providers such as mainstream social sites or web-mail services.  Another relevant factor that may be taken
into account is the number of users the connected account has engaged with and how persistent the engagement is.  In some embodiments, these input variables may present variance, typically with non-Gaussian, long-tailed distribution.  To counter these
artefacts, in some embodiments, the reputation scoring system can reduce such heterogeneity by applying slow increasing functions, such as a logarithmic function, so that the resulting distribution is not dramatically different whether the connected
account has engaged 1,000 users or 1 million users, but it is very different for 5 versus 100 users.
<br/><br/> Identity may be gathered from providing information that may signify whether the user is who the user indicates they are, because such information may be difficult to obtain.  For example, if a user provides a phone number or email address, the
reputation scoring system can attribute a higher score if the phone number or email address belongs to a well-known corporation or university.  In some embodiments, the reputation scoring system can implement a two-step passport verification to verify a
top level in identity.  In such embodiments, the reputation scoring system can verify a digital copy of a government-issued ID and then match the face recognized from the picture of the government-issued ID with the voice recognized from the key-phrased
recorded in the video or audio from phone verification.
<br/><br/> Transactions may be gathered from reviews and ratings associated with online transactions on websites such as EBay, Airbnb, Uber, or Etsy, among others.  To determine the raw ratings from various websites, the reputation scoring system can first
normalize the raw ratings based on the overall reputation of the respective platform and then determine the reputation of the user within the platform.  Transactions may take into account a temporal component.  For example, the reputation scoring system
can assign a lower transaction score when a person with previously excellent reviews starts to commit fraud on EBay.  In another example, the influence of a particular rating may decrease over time.
<br/><br/> Network reputation score may be based on the trust relationship between the user and other entities.  Network reputation score may be determined based on reputation increases and reputation decreases.  Reputation increases may signify the gain
to network reputation based on the number of trusters that the user is associated with.  Reputation decreases, on the other hand, may signify the risk of a user in trusting another user, and may be based on the number of people that the user trusts and
may depend on time.  For example, if a user trusts another user and afterward the other user receives a poor review on a transaction, the network reputation of the first user may also be reduced.  The total reputation score may be based on the intrinsic
reputation score and the network reputation score.  For example, the total reputation score may be a sum of the intrinsic reputation score and the network reputation score.
<br/><br/> To determine the network reputation score, the reputation scoring system can generate a trust network that includes a graph depicting trust relationships among various entities.  Nodes in this graph may be restricted to represent natural
persons, as opposed to corporations and institutions.  The trust network may be considered as the projection of user space of a bipartite graph of institutions and individuals.  The trust links may be unidirectional, since user A's trust of user B may
not imply user B trusting user A. The existence of a trust link may imply a certain level of agreement between the two nodes, even if one user rejects the other.  Furthermore, the graph may take into account, the cost of a social link.  The cost may be
related to the risk that if user A trusts user B and user B receives a bad review, user B's reputation may decrease as well as user A's reputation.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 2, a block diagram depicting an embodiment of a system 120 for generating digital reputation scores is shown.  In brief overview, the system 120 can include an account manager 202, an intrinsic reputation generator 210, a
network reputation generator 220, a digital reputation score generator 230, and a database 240.  The system 120 can include or interactive with one or more clients 102a-n (or client device 102), one or more servers 106a-n (or server 106).  The account
manager 202, the intrinsic reputation generator 210, the network reputation generator 220 and the digital reputation score generator 230 can each include one or more processing units or other logic devices such as programmable logic array engines,
modules, or circuitry designed and constructed to facilitate generating a digital reputation score.  In some implementations, the account manager 202, the intrinsic reputation generator 210, the network reputation generator 220 and the digital reputation
score generator 230 can include a script, computer-executable instructions, a file, or other executable object that can be used to generate a digital reputation score of a user.  The system 120 can include components 100 shown in FIG. 1C or FIG. 1D or be
configured to operate as a service in cloud 108.  The system 120 can include or interact with one or more servers 106a-n and clients 102a-n.
<br/><br/> The account manager 202 can be configured to maintain accounts for one or more users of the reputation scoring system 120.  The account manager 202 can maintain and manage accounts of the one or more users.  The account manager 202 can store
information pertaining to the accounts of the users in the database 240.  Each account can include information of a respective user.  In some implementations, the account manager 202 can be configured to register a user on the system 120.  As part of the
registration, the account manager 202 can receive information from the user identifying one or more online accounts of the user.  The online accounts can pertain to accounts the user has established with a variety of different online websites, platforms,
applications, among others.  For instance, the user can identify one or more social networking accounts, one or more email addresses associated with email accounts, one or more websites, among others.  The account manager 202 can retrieve account
information from one or more of these accounts of the user.  In some implementations, the account manager 202 may retrieve the information via application program interfaces (APIs).  In some implementations, the account manager 202 can receive
information from servers of websites or entities with which the user has accounts.  The information can include information about the history of the user's account, transaction information of the account, online activity of the user via the account, as
well as information relating to other users of the entity with which the user has a connection, among others.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the account manager 202 can identify one or more other accounts maintained by one or more other servers 106a-n. For example, if a user maintains an account on <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> LINKEDIN, TWITTER, and EBAY, the account manager 202
can identify the accounts on the servers 106a-n of <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> LINKEDIN, TWITTER, and EBAY as belonging to and maintained by that user.  In some implementations, the account manager 202 can identify or receive information relating to the user from each of
the servers 106a-n. The information can include a list of contacts of the user, one or more online activities performed by the user at the respective server, one or more transactions performed by the user via the respective server, among others.  The
account manager 202 can store the information in the database 240 and may be configured to make the information accessible to each of the intrinsic reputation generator 210, the network reputation generator 220 and the digital reputation score generator
230.
<br/><br/> The intrinsic reputation generator 210 can be configured to generate an intrinsic reputation score of the user.  The intrinsic reputation generator 210 can generate the intrinsic reputation score of a user based on the information provided by
the user or based on other online activity of the user that is accessible by the intrinsic reputation generator 210.  In some implementations, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can generate an intrinsic reputation score based on three dimensions,
namely, online activity 212, identity 214 and transactions 216.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation score of the user may be a sum of an online activity score, an identity score, and an transaction score.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic
reputation score of the user may be a weighted sum of the online activity score, the identity score, and the transaction score.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can determine a number of online accounts with which each of the one or more other accounts has interacted.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can aggregate
the number of connections of the user from one or more accounts maintained by the one or more other servers 106a-n. For example, if a user has 1,500 connections on LinkedIn and 1,100 on <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can access the
respective servers 106a-n and determine that the user is interacting with 2,600 other users by aggregating the number of connections accessed from the respective servers 106a-n. In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can determine a
length of time for which the one or more other accounts have been established.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can access the length of time for which the one or more other accounts have been established from the one or more
accounts maintained by the one or more other servers 106a-n. For example, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can determine that the user has established an account with LinkedIn 2 months ago by accessing either a database 240 or a server 106 of
LinkedIn.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can determine the length of time for which the one or more other accounts have been established by accessing the date that the one or more other accounts have been established from
the one or more other servers 106a-n. In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can determine the length of time for which one or more accounts have been established by accessing the server of the entity with which the account was
established and identifying activity of the account.  For example, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can, via the server of the entity providing the email address, identify that an email address of the user received its first email in January, 2010.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can apply a slow increasing function to the determined length of time or the number of online actions with which an online account has interacted to counter-measure high variance in the
determined length of time or the number of online actions across different online accounts.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can use a slow increasing function towards the number of accounts associated with the user to
determine the online activity score.  For example, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can use a logarithmic function, such that the online activity score of a user account engaged with 1,000 other users is not much different from one engaged with 1
million other users but may differ greatly between a user account engaged with 5 other users versus 100 other users.  In another example, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can use a function of the following form:
<br/><br/> .A-inverted.&gt;.function..times.dd&lt; ##EQU00001## where r(t)=.alpha.e.sup..beta.t, .alpha.&gt;0, and .beta.&lt;0, such that .A-inverted.t.sub.1, t.sub.2&gt;0, t.sub.2t.sub.1r(t.sub.2r(t.sub.1).  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation
generator 210 can apply the slow increasing function to the intrinsic reputation score.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can apply the slow increasing function to one or more of the online activity score, identity score, and
transaction score.
<br/><br/> The intrinsic reputation generator 210 can also be configured to generate the identity score of a user.  The identity score of the user can indicate a level of verification of the user.  Setting up an online account can be done fairly easily and
generally is not tied to the natural person in the sense that someone may establish an online account pretending to be someone else.  As such, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can generate an identity score that can provide a metric that helps one
determine how likely the person having the online account is the natural person they are presenting themselves online.
<br/><br/> To generate an identity score, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can verify whether the online accounts of the user maintained by servers of various online platforms are tied to the natural person associated with the user of the reputation
scoring system.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can identify a domain name of an email address provided by the user.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can determine that the domain name belongs to
an entity that satisfies a predetermined criteria.  The predetermined criteria can specify types of entities, such as universities, corporations, among other entities.  For example, if the predetermined criteria specifies "efg_corporation.com" and the
email address provided by the user is "john_doe@efg_corporation.com," the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can determine that the email address belongs to "EFG Corp." In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can, responsive to
determining that the domain name belongs to an entity that satisfies the predetermined criteria, generate an identity score used to generate the intrinsic reputation score.  The identity score may represent the identity measure of a user in the intrinsic
reputation score.  In some embodiments, the identity score may be dependent on the verifiability of the online account associated with the user.  For example, a user with the email account "ABC@aol.com" may have a lower second component score than
another user with the email account "DEF@furniture_dealer.com" because the email account "ABC@aol.com" may not be tied to a particular entity or organization.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can establish or otherwise confirm the identity of a particular online user.  In some embodiments, In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can confirm the identity
of a particular online user by comparing features of an image included in a government-issued ID with features of an image received from the user.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can receive a first image of a
government-issued ID of the user.  A government-issued ID can include a passport, driver's license, fishing license, military IDs, or any other suitable identification issued by a government with a face appearing on one side.  In some embodiments, the
government-issued ID of the user can include the user's face.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can identify, from the government-issued ID, data representative of the face of the user.  For example, once the government-issued
ID is scanned, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can identify the face of the user on a government-issued ID by using pattern recognition algorithms such as principal component analysis, linear discriminate analysis, and feature identification
analysis, among others.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can receive, via a video file, a second image.  In some embodiments, the second image can include the face of the user.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation
generator 210 can compare features of the user's face from the first image to features of the face of the user included in the second image.  For example, once the first image and the second image has been acquired, the intrinsic reputation generator 210
can compare the features of the user's face from the first image to the features of the second image using feature detection algorithms and then applying nearest neighbor algorithms to determine the similarity of the features of the user's face between
the first image and the second image.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can increase a value of a second component score, responsive to determining that the use's face included in the first image matches the face of the user in
the second image.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can determine the transactions score used for the intrinsic reputation score based on online transactions performed by the user.  Online transactions can include, for example, purchases
of goods or services, returns, and reviews and ratings of such transactions, among others.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation generator 210 can receive data corresponding to online accounts of the users maintained by a plurality of other
servers 106a-n corresponding to other entities.  The data can include data representative of one or more online transactions performed by the user.  For example, Amazon.com may maintain online transaction data corresponding to online accounts of users on
one or more servers 106a-n. In this example, Amazon.com, responsive to a request from the intrinsic reputation generator 210, can transmit the online transaction data to the intrinsic reputation generator 210.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic
reputation generator 210 can determine the transactions score of the user using the received data.  The transactions score may represent the online transactions made by the user.  For example, a user that has mostly favorable reviews regarding the user's
sales of goods to others may have a higher transactions score.  In contrast, a user that has mostly negative reviews regarding the user's sale of goods to others (such as descriptions of the user's poor quality or fraudulent transactions) may have a
lower transactions score.
<br/><br/> The network reputation generator 220 can be configured to determine a network reputation of users of the reputation scoring system.  The network reputation of a user can be based on trust relationships established by servers of the reputation
scoring system.  The trust relationships are unidirectional.  The network reputation score of a user is based in part on the number of users that trust the user, the number of users that the user trusts, and the network reputation score of each of the
other users in the reputation scoring system.  A user that establishes, via the server, a unidirectional trust relationship to other users can be referred to as a truster of the other users.  Conversely, users that establish, via the server, a
unidirectional trust relationship to the first user can be referred to as trusters of the first user.
<br/><br/> The network reputation generator 220 can identify, from a first online account of the user, a first set of online accounts with which the first online account established, via the server, a unidirectional trust relationship to each respective
online account of the first set of online accounts.  In some embodiments, the reputation scoring system may establish a unidirectional trust relationship from the first online account to the first set of online accounts in response to the reputation
scoring system receiving one or more requests to establish a unidirectional trust relationship from the first online account to each of the first set of online accounts.  The unidirectional trust relationships from each respective online account of the
second set of online accounts of the first online account can be defined to include relationships between natural persons.  The server can identify an account of the first online user and determine a number of second users with which the first online
user has established a unidirectional trust relationship.  The server can establish unidirectional trust relationships from the first user to a second user responsive to receiving a request to establish a unidirectional trust relationship from the first
user.  Here, the network reputation generator 220 can identify the users to which the first user is identified as a truster.
<br/><br/> The network reputation generator 220 can identify, from the first online account of the first user, a second set of online accounts that established unidirectional trust relationships from each respective online account of the second set of
online accounts to the first online account.  The network reputation generator 220 can identify an account of the first online user and determine, from the account of the first online user, a number of second users that have established, via the server,
a unidirectional trust relationship from the respective second user to the first user.  Here, the network reputation generator 220 can identify the trusters of the first user.  The network reputation generator 220 can establish unidirectional trust
relationships from the respective second users to the first user in response to receiving a request to establish a unidirectional trust relationship from the respective second user.
<br/><br/> The network reputation generator 220 can generate, for the first online account of the user, a network reputation score based on a first number of trust relationships established with the first set of online account and a second number of trust
relationships established with the second set of online accounts.  The network reputation score may represent the score of the user based on the user's network reputation.  In some embodiments, the network reputation generator 220 can determine the
second reputation score based on the reputation increase and reputation decrease of the user.  The second reputation score may be, for example, in the following form: N(u)=N.sup.+(u)-N.sup.-(u) where N.sup.+(u) represents that the reputation increase and
N.sup.-(u) represents the reputation decrease each for user u.
<br/><br/> The reputation increase may, for example, be of the form:
<br/><br/> .function..times..alpha..function..function..times..function..function..f- unction..times..function.  ##EQU00002## where .alpha.  is greater than zero, t.sub.i.sup.l+ is a node that belongs to T.sup.l+(u), and K is the average degree of the
network such that K.sup.l-K.sup.l-1 is the expected number of nodes in T.sup.l+(u).  In this example, T.sup.l+(u) denotes the set of nodes that trust user u. T.sup.l+(u) may be defined to satisfy two conditions: that there is at least one directed path
of length l in the trust network starting along the path of length l to the user u and that the nodes do not belong to any of the sets {T.sup.1+, T.sup.2+, .  . . T.sup.(N-1)+}.
<br/><br/> Continuing this example, suppose that the path length L=1 and the users are associated in the manner seen in FIG. 3A.  FIG. 3A depicts an embodiment of a trust network.  In FIG. 3A, users A-E are each represented with nodes 305, 310, 315, 320,
and 325 respectively.  Furthermore, in this example, assume that the intrinsic reputation value of the users, I(u), are as follows: I(A)=I(B)=2 and I(E)=I(C)=I(D)=5.  Then, for user A
<br/><br/> .function..function..times..function..function..function..times..times..t- imes..function.  ##EQU00003## In this example, since user A 305 has no connections from user A 305 with other users 310-325, N.sup.-(A)=0.  For the network, consider that
K=4 and since T.sup.1+(A)={E, C}:
<br/><br/> .function..function..function..times..function..function..function..times- ..function..times..times.  ##EQU00004## Therefore, R(A)=I(A)+N(A)=2+1.5=3.5 In addition, by symmetry, N(B)=N(A)=3.5 Conversely, the reputation decrease may, for example,
be of the form:
<br/><br/> .function..di-elect cons..function..times..function..function..times..function.  ##EQU00005## where I(v,t) denotes the intrinsic reputation of user v at time t. In this example, if a user u trusts another user v and then afterwards the intrinsic
reputation of v decreases, such as by receiving a negative review, then the network reputation of u likewise decreases.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the network reputation generator 220 can determine, for each of the first set of online accounts and the second set of online accounts, a respective network reputation score.  In some embodiments, the network reputation
generator 220 can determine the network reputation score of the first online account using the network reputation scores of each of the first set of online accounts and the second set of online accounts.  In some embodiments, the network reputation
generator 220 can weigh the network reputation score of each of the first set of the online accounts and the second set of online accounts according to a function of time.
<br/><br/> The digital reputation score generator 230 can generate, for the first online account of the user, a digital reputation score using the intrinsic reputation score of the user and the network reputation score of the user.  For example, the
digital reputation score generator 230 can determine the digital reputation score based on the sum of the intrinsic reputation score of the user and the network reputation score of the user, using the following form: R(u)=I(u)+N(u) where R denotes
digital reputation score, N denotes network-based reputation, and I denotes intrinsic-based reputation for user u. In some embodiments, the digital reputation score generator 230 can update the digital reputation score responsive to determining that a
network reputation score of an online account of the first set of online accounts has decreased.
<br/><br/> The digital reputation score generated by the digital reputation score generator 230 can exhibit a certain number of properties.  First, the sole additive source of reputation score in the trust network may be the intrinsic reputation score. 
That is, in a network where the intrinsic reputation score is zero for every user v in the network, the digital reputation score may also be zero.  Second, loops in the network may not be dominated by stationary distribution artefacts.  While the digital
reputation gathered by one user is expected to increase linearly with the number of incoming links from other users, the marginal contributions by such other users to the reputation of the user may be inversely proportional to the number of people
trusted by the user.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3B, FIG. 3B depicts a block diagram of an embodiment of a trust network.  In FIG. 3B, a random surfer in the trust network may get stuck in the loop created by node C 340 and D 345, thereby producing a degenerated stationary
visit distribution such that {P(A)=P(B)=0, P(C)=P(D)=0.5}.  One approach may be to tweak the algorithm so that such loops in the network do not become overrepresented.  In the present approach, however, since one user may contribute to the digital
reputation score of another user only once, there may be no significant loop effects.  Lastly, the digital reputation score of a user decreases with more outgoing links in the trust network.  This close neighborhood effect, however, may not propagate
through the network, because after the decrease occurs, the users with whom the user has directly trusted in the tree may be considered accountable.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 4, FIG. 4 is a flow diagram depicting a method 400 for generating digital reputation scores.  The functionality described herein in the method 400 can be performed by any one or more components system 100 depicted in FIGS.
1A-1D such as one or more of the servers 106a-n, or any one or more components of system 200 depicted in FIG. 2.  In brief overview, the server of the reputation scoring system can generate a first reputation score of a user based on online activity
associated with the user, identity verification of the user and online transaction history of the user (BLOCK 405).  The server can identify, from a first online account of the user, a first set of online accounts with which the first online account
established a unidirectional trust relationship from the first online account to each respective online account of the first set of online accounts (BLOCK 410).  The server can identify from the first online account of the first user, a second set of
online accounts that have established, via the server, unidirectional trust relationships from each respective online account of the second set of online accounts to the first online account (BLOCK 415).  The server can generate for the first online
account of the user, a second reputation score based on a first number of trust relationships established with the first set of online accounts and a second number of trust relationships established with the second set of online accounts (BLOCK 420). 
The server can generate, for the first online account of the user, a third reputation score using the first reputation score of the user and the second reputation score of the user (BLOCK 425).
<br/><br/> In further detail, the server can generate a first reputation score of a user based on online activity with the user (BLOCK 405).  The first reputation score of a user may represent the intrinsic reputation score of the user.  In some
embodiments, the intrinsic reputation score of the user may be a sum of an online activity score, identity score, and transaction score.  In some embodiments, the intrinsic reputation score of the user may be a weighted sum of an online activity score,
identity score, and transaction score.  In some embodiments, the system 120 can maintain a plurality of online accounts in a database 240.  In some embodiments, the server can identify one or more other accounts maintained by one or more other servers. 
For example, if a user maintains an account on <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> LINKEDIN, TWITTER, and EBAY, the server can identify the accounts on the servers of <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> LINKEDIN, TWITTER, and EBAY as belonging to and maintained by that user.  In some embodiments, the
server can determine, using information associated with the one or more other accounts, the online activity score used to generate the intrinsic reputation score.  The online activity score can be based on the online activity related to a user.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the server can determine a number of online accounts with which each of the one or more other accounts has interacted.  In some embodiments, the server can access the length of time for which the one or more other accounts
have been established from the one or more accounts maintained by the one or more other servers.  In some embodiments, the server can determine the length of time for which the one or more other accounts have been established by accessing the date that
the one or more other accounts have been established from the one or more other servers.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the server can apply a slow increasing function to the determined length of time or the number of online actions with which an online account has interacted to count-measure high-variance in the determined length of time or
the number of online actions across different online accounts.  In some embodiments, the server can use a slow increasing function of the number of accounts associated with the user to determine the online activity score.  In some embodiments, the server
can apply the slow increasing function to the first reputation score.  In some embodiments, the server can apply the slow increasing function to one or more of the online activity score, identity score, and transaction score.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the server can identify a domain name of an email address provided by the user.  In some embodiments, the server can determine that the domain name belongs to an entity that satisfies a predetermined criteria.  The
predetermined criteria can specify types of entities, such as universities, corporations, or other servers 106a-n. In some embodiments, the server can, responsive to determining that the domain name belongs to an entity that satisfies the predetermined
criteria, generate an identity score used to generate the intrinsic reputation score.  The identity score may represent the identity measure of a user in the intrinsic reputation score determination.  In some embodiments, the second component score may
be dependent on the verifiability of the online account associated with the user.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the server can establish or otherwise confirm the identity of a particular online user.  In some embodiments, the server can confirm the identity of a particular online user by comparing features of an image included in a
government-issued ID with features of an image received from the user.  In some embodiments, the server can receive a first image of a government-issued ID of the user.  A government-issued ID can include a passport, driver's license, fishing license,
military IDs, or any other suitable identification issued by a government with a face appearing on at least one side.  In some embodiments, the government-issued ID of the user can include the user's face.  In some embodiments, the server can identify,
from the government-issued ID, data representative of the face of the user.  For example, once the government-issued ID is scanned, the server can identify the face of the user on a government-issued ID by using pattern recognition algorithms such as
principal component analysis, linear discriminate analysis, and feature identification analysis, among others.  In some embodiments, the server can receive, via a video file, a second image.  In some embodiments, the second image can include the face of
the user.  In some embodiments, the server can compare features of the user's face from the first image to features of the face of the user included in the second image.  For example, once the first image and the second image has been acquired, the
server can compare the features of the user's face from the first image to the features of the second image using feature detection algorithms and then applying nearest neighbor algorithms to determine the similarity of the features of the user's face
between the first image and the second image.  In some embodiments, the server can increase a value of a second component score, responsive to determining that the use's face included in the first image matches the face of the user in the second image.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the server can determine a transactions score for the intrinsic reputation score based on online transactions performed by the user.  Online transactions can include, for example, purchases of goods or services, returns, and
reviews and ratings of such transactions, among others.  In some embodiments, the server can receive data corresponding to online accounts of the users maintained by a plurality of other servers 106a-n corresponding to other entities.  The data can
include data representative of one or more online transactions performed by the user.  In some embodiments, the server can determine, using the received data, the transactions score to generate the intrinsic reputation score.  For example, a user that
has mostly favorable reviews regarding the user's sales of goods to others may have a higher transactions score than a user with average reviews.  In contrast, a user that has mostly negative reviews regarding the user's sale of goods to others (such as
descriptions of the user's poor quality or fraudulent transactions) may have a lower transactions score than a user with average reviews.
<br/><br/> The server can identify, from a first online account of the user, a first set of online accounts with which the first online account established a unidirectional trust relationship from the first online account to each respective online account
of the first set of online accounts (BLOCK 410).  In some embodiments, the reputation scoring system may establish a unidirectional trust relationship from the first online account to the first set of online accounts in response to the reputation scoring
system receiving one or more requests to establish a unidirectional trust relationship from the first online account to each of the first set of online accounts.  The unidirectional trust relationships from each respective online account of the second
set of online accounts of the first online account can be defined to include relationships between natural persons.  The server can identify an account of the first online user and determine a number of second users with which the user has established a
unidirectional trust relationship.  The server can establish unidirectional trust relationships from the first user to a second user responsive to receiving a request to establish a unidirectional trust relationship from the first user.
<br/><br/> The server of the reputation scoring system can identify, from the first online account of the first user, a second set of online accounts that established unidirectional trust relationships from each respective online account of the second set
of online accounts to the first online account (BLOCK 415).  The server can identify an account of the first online user and determine, from the account of the first online user, a number of second users that have established, via the server, a
unidirectional trust relationship from the respective second user to the first user.  The server can establish unidirectional trust relationships from the respective second users to the first user in response to receiving a request to establish a
unidirectional trust relationship from the respective second user.
<br/><br/> The server can generate, for the first online account of the user, a second reputation score based on a first number of trust relationships established with the first set of online accounts and a second number of trust relationships established
with the second set of online accounts (BLOCK 420).  The second reputation score may represent the score of the user based on the user's network reputation.  In some embodiments, the server can determine the second reputation score based on the
reputation increase and reputation decrease of the user.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the server can determine, for each of the first set of online accounts and the second set of online accounts, a respective second reputation score.  In some embodiments, the server can determine the second reputation score
of the first online account using the second reputation scores of each of the first set of online accounts and the second set of online accounts.  In some embodiments, the server can weigh the second reputation score of each of the first set of the
online accounts and the second set of online accounts according to a function of time.
<br/><br/> The server can generate, for the first online account of the user, a third reputation score using the first reputation score of the user and the second reputation score of the user (BLOCK 425).  For example, the server can determine the third
reputation score based on the sum of the first reputation score of the user and the second reputation score of the user.  In some embodiments, the server can update the third reputation score responsive to determining that a second reputation score of an
online account of the first set of online accounts has decreased.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 5, FIG. 5 is a depiction of an embodiment of a graphical user interface 500.  The graphical user interface 500 can include user photo 505, a reputation indicator 510, one or more verification indicators 515, short biography
520, one-up button 525, unfriend button 530, link to reviews 535, and one or more vouch indicators 540, among others.  The user photo 505 can include a picture of the user.  The reputation indicator 510 can include an indication of the reputation of the
user.  The reputation of the user can include a numerical score, numerical range, and verbal classification (as depicted), among others.  The one or more verification indicators 515 can include the various types of verification that the user has
registered.  For example, in FIG. 5, the user has been verified via email, social networks, and smartphone.  The short biography 520 can include a name of the user, location of the user, and number of friends, among others.  The short biography 520 can
also include a link for more information about the user.  The one-up button 525 can be used to create a connection with the user or increase the total reputation of the user, among others.  The unfriend button 530 can be used to sever the connection with
the user or decrease the total reputation of the user, among others.  The link to reviews 535 can be used to display ratings or rankings earned by the user on other social media.  The one or more vouches 540 can include a list of vouches or trust
relationships from other users of the trust network.  In general, the more vouches 540 that a user has, the higher total reputation score of the user is.
<br/><br/> While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific embodiments, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the
spirit and scope of the invention described in this disclosure.
