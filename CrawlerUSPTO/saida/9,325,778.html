       <p> In one embodiment, one or more servers providing an on-line service send
     a token to a first client computing device associated with a first user
     of the on-line service, the token being generated by the servers based at
     least in part on a user identifier of the first user; the serves receive
     the token from a second client computing device associated with a second
     user of the on-line service, the token being sent to the second client
     computing device from the first client computing device through a
     wireless connection; the servers verify the token based at least in part
     on the user identifier of the first user; the servers determine data
     accessible to the second user if the token is verified; the servers also
     send to the second client computing device at least some of the data
     accessible to the second user.

<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method, comprising: by one or more servers of a system providing an online service, sending a token to a first client computing device associated with a first user of
the online service, the token being generated by the servers based at least in part on a user identifier of the first user;  by the servers, receiving the token from a second client computing device associated with a second user of the online service,
the token being sent to the second client computing device from the first client computing device through a wireless connection;  by the servers, verifying the token based at least in part on the user identifier of the first user and a least number of
edges traversed in a social graph from a first node corresponding to the first user to a second node corresponding to the second user;  by the servers, determining data accessible to the second user in an event that the token is verified, wherein said
determining includes determining a list of nodes in the social graph for access to the second user, the list of nodes representing connections common to both the first node and the second node;  and by the servers, sending to the second client computing
device at least some of the data accessible to the second user.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, wherein the data accessible to the second user comprises the user identifier of the first user.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1, wherein the verifying the token is further based on respective locations associated with the first and second client computing devices, wherein the respective locations are determined by the first and second client
computing devices based on global positioning system (GPS), cellular signal triangulation, Wi-Fi hotspot locations, or any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 1, wherein the token expires after being verified by the servers.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 1, wherein the sending the token to the first client computing device is through a secured connection between the first client computing device and the servers.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 1, wherein the wireless connection is based on a Wi-Fi, short-range wireless communications interface, peer-to-peer cellular, or Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) protocol.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 1, wherein the wireless connection comprises a third client computing device associated with a third user of the online service.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 1, wherein: the system is a social-networking system comprising the social graph comprising a plurality of nodes and edges connecting the nodes, including the first node and the second node;  and the online service is a
social-networking service provided by the social- networking system.

<br/><br/> This disclosure generally relates to social networks.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A social-networking system, which may include a social-networking website, may enable its users (such as persons or organizations) to interact with it and with each other through it.  The social-networking system may, with input from a user,
create and store in the social-networking system a user profile associated with the user.  The user profile may include demographic information, communication-channel information, and information on personal interests of the user.  The social-networking
system may also, with input from a user, create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social-networking system, as well as provide services (e.g. wall posts, photo-sharing, event organization, messaging, games, or
advertisements) to facilitate social interaction between or among users.
<br/><br/> The social-networking system may send over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user.  A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of
the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social-networking system.  The social-networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user, such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other
users connected to the user.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, each client computing device of one or more users of a social-networking system may connect to the social-networking system through a secured connection and acquire from the social-networking system a one-time token
that is associated with a respective user.  A first client computing device of a first user may send its token to a second client computing device of a second user through a peer-to-peer wireless network.  The second client computing device may then send
the token to the social-networking system.  The social-networking system may verify that the token is associated with the first user.  The social-networking system may look up a social graph and privacy settings of the first user to determine data
accessible to the second user if the token is verified.  The social-networking system may send at least some of the data accessible to the second user to the second client computing device.  After the token is verified and the data accessible to the
second user is determined, information sharing and interaction between the first and second client computing devices (and between the first and second users) may be facilitated through the social-networking system, instead of the peer-to-peer wireless
network between the first and second client computing devices. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example network environment 100 associated with a social-networking system.  Network environment 100 includes a user 101, a client system 130, a social-networking system 160, and a third-party system 170 connected to each
other by a network 110.  Although FIG. 1 illustrates a particular arrangement of user 101, client system 130, social-networking system 160, third-party system 170, and network 110, this disclosure contemplates any suitable arrangement of user 101, client
system 130, social-networking system 160, third-party system 170, and network 110.  As an example and not by way of limitation, two or more of client system 130, social-networking system 160, and third-party system 170 may be connected to each other
directly, bypassing network 110.  As another example, two or more of client system 130, social-networking system 160, and third-party system 170 may be physically or logically co-located with each other in whole or in part.  Moreover, although FIG. 1
illustrates a particular number of users 101, client systems 130, social-networking systems 160, third-party systems 170, and networks 110, this disclosure contemplates any suitable number of users 101, client systems 130, social-networking systems 160,
third-party systems 170, and networks 110.  As an example and not by way of limitation, network environment 100 may include multiple users 101, client system 130, social-networking systems 160, third-party systems 170, and networks 110.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, user 101 may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third-party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over
social-networking system 160.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may be a network-addressable computing system hosting an online social network.  Social-networking system 160 may generate, store, receive, and send social-networking
data, such as, for example, user-profile data, concept-profile data, social-graph information, or other suitable data related to the online social network.  Social-networking system 160 may be accessed by the other components of network environment 100
either directly or via network 110.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may include an authorization server (or other suitable component(s)) that allows users 101 to opt in to or opt out of having their actions logged by
social-networking system 160 or shared with other systems (e.g., third-party systems 170), for example, by setting appropriate privacy settings.  A privacy setting of a user may determine what information associated with the user may be logged, how
information associated with the user may be logged, when information associated with the user may be logged, who may log information associated with the user, whom information associated with the user may be shared with, and for what purposes information
associated with the user may be logged or shared.  Authorization servers may be used to enforce one or more privacy settings of the users of social-networking system 160 through blocking, data hashing, anonymization, or other suitable techniques as
appropriate.  In particular embodiments, third-party system 170 may be a network-addressable computing system that can host websites and applications.  Third-party system 170 may generate, store, receive, and send third-party system data, such as, for
example and without limitation, web pages, text, images, video, audio, or applications.  Third-party system 170 may be accessed by the other components of network environment 100 either directly or via network 110.  In particular embodiments, one or more
users 101 may use one or more client systems 130 to access, send data to, and receive data from social-networking system 160 or third-party system 170.  Client system 130 may access social-networking system 160 or third-party system 170 directly, via
network 110, or via a third-party system.  As an example and not by way of limitation, client system 130 may access third-party system 170 via social-networking system 160.  Client system 130 may be any suitable computing device, such as, for example, a
personal computer, a laptop computer, a cellular telephone, a smartphone, or a tablet computer.  In particular embodiments, client system 130 may be an exercise equipment, an appliance, a car, a bicycle, a heart rate monitor, or a blood pressure monitor.
<br/><br/> This disclosure contemplates any suitable network 110.  As an example and not by way of limitation, one or more portions of network 110 may include an ad hoc network, an intranet, an extranet, a virtual private network (VPN), a local area
network (LAN), a wireless LAN (WLAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless WAN (WWAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a portion of the Internet, a portion of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), a cellular telephone network, or a
combination of two or more of these.  Network 110 may include one or more networks 110.
<br/><br/> Links 150 may connect client system 130, social-networking system 160, and third-party system 170 to communication network 110 or to each other.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable links 150.  In particular embodiments, one or more links
150 include one or more wireline (such as for example Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)), wireless (such as for example Wi-Fi or 802.11, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), or
wireless communication over TV whitespace), or optical (such as for example Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) or Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)) links.  In particular embodiments, one or more links 150 each include an ad hoc network, an intranet,
an extranet, a VPN, a LAN (e.g., Ethernet), a WLAN, a WAN, a WWAN, a MAN, a portion of the Internet, a portion of the PSTN, a cellular technology-based network (e.g., GSM, GPRS, UMTS, or LTE), a satellite communications technology-based network, another
link 150, or a combination of two or more such links 150.  Links 150 need not necessarily be the same throughout network environment 100.  One or more first links 150 may differ in one or more respects from one or more second links 150.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates example social graph 200.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may store one or more social graphs 200 in one or more data stores.  In particular embodiments, social graph 200 may include multiple
nodes--which may include multiple user nodes 202 or multiple concept nodes 204--and multiple edges 206 connecting the nodes.  Example social graph 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 is shown, for didactic purposes, in a two-dimensional visual map representation. 
In particular embodiments, a social-networking system 160, client system 130, or third-party system 170 may access social graph 200 and related social-graph information for suitable applications.  The nodes and edges of social graph 200 may be stored as
data objects, for example, in a data store (such as a social-graph database).  Such a data store may include one or more searchable or queryable indexes of nodes or edges of social graph 200.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may correspond to a user of social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g. an enterprise, business, or third-party
application), or a group (e.g. of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over social-networking system 160.  In particular embodiments, when a user registers for an account with social-networking system 160, social-networking
system 160 may create a user node 202 corresponding to the user, and store the user node 202 in one or more data stores.  Users and user nodes 202 described herein may, where appropriate, refer to registered users and user nodes 202 associated with
registered users.  In addition or as an alternative, users and user nodes 202 described herein may, where appropriate, refer to users that have not registered with social-networking system 160.  In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may be
associated with information provided by a user or information gathered by various systems, including social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may provide his or her name, profile picture, contact information,
birth date, sex, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, or other demographic information.  In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to
information associated with a user.  In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may correspond to one or more webpages.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may correspond to a concept.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a concept may correspond to a place (such as, for example, a movie theater, restaurant, landmark, or city); a website (such
as, for example, a website associated with social-network system 160 or a third-party website associated with a web-application server); an entity (such as, for example, a person, business, group, sports team, or celebrity); a resource (such as, for
example, an audio file, video file, digital photo, text file, structured document, or application) which may be located within social-networking system 160 or on an external server, such as a web-application server; real or intellectual property (such
as, for example, a sculpture, painting, movie, game, song, idea, photograph, or written work); a game; an activity; an idea or theory; another suitable concept; or two or more such concepts.  A concept node 204 may be associated with information of a
concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems, including social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, information of a concept may include a name or a title; one or more images (e.g. an image of the
cover page of a book); a location (e.g. an address or a geographical location); a website (which may be associated with a URL); contact information (e.g. a phone number or an email address); other suitable concept information; or any suitable combination
of such information.  In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node 204.  In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may correspond to one or
more webpages.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a node in social graph 200 may represent or be represented by a webpage (which may be referred to as a "profile page").  Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social-networking system 160.  Profile pages may
also be hosted on third-party websites associated with a third-party server 170.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may
correspond to a particular concept node 204.  Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user node 202 may have a corresponding user-profile page in which the corresponding
user may add content, make declarations, or otherwise express himself or herself.  As another example and not by way of limitation, a concept node 204 may have a corresponding concept-profile page in which one or more users may add content, make
declarations, or express themselves, particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node 204.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may represent a third-party webpage or resource hosted by a third-party system 170.  The third-party webpage or resource may include, among other elements, content, a selectable or other icon, or
other inter-actable object (which may be implemented, for example, in JavaScript, AJAX, or PHP codes) representing an action or activity.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a third-party webpage may include a selectable icon such as "like,"
"check in," "eat," "recommend," or another suitable action or activity.  A user viewing the third-party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons (e.g. "eat"), causing a client system 130 to send to social-networking system 160 a
message indicating the user's action.  In response to the message, social-networking system 160 may create an edge (e.g. an "eat" edge) between a user node 202 corresponding to the user and a concept node 204 corresponding to the third-party webpage or
resource and store edge 206 in one or more data stores.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a pair of nodes in social graph 200 may be connected to each other by one or more edges 206.  An edge 206 connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes.  In particular embodiments,
an edge 206 may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a first user may indicate that a second user is a "friend" of the first
user.  In response to this indication, social-networking system 160 may send a "friend request" to the second user.  If the second user confirms the "friend request," social-networking system 160 may create an edge 206 connecting the first user's user
node 202 to the second user's user node 202 in social graph 200 and store edge 206 as social-graph information in one or more of data stores.  In the example of FIG. 2, social graph 200 includes an edge 206 indicating a friend relation between user nodes
202 of user "A" and user "B" and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes 202 of user "C" and user "B." Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges 206 with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes 202,
this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges 206 with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes 202.  As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge 206 may represent a friendship, family relationship, business or employment relationship, fan
relationship, follower relationship, visitor relationship, subscriber relationship, superior/subordinate relationship, reciprocal relationship, non-reciprocal relationship, another suitable type of relationship, or two or more such relationships. 
Moreover, although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected, this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected.  Herein, references to users or concepts being connected may, where appropriate, refer to the nodes
corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph 200 by one or more edges 206.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, an edge 206 between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node 202 toward a concept associated with a concept node 204.  As an
example and not by way of limitation, as illustrated in FIG. 2, a user may "like," "attended," "played," "listened," "cooked," "worked at," or "watched" a concept, each of which may correspond to an edge type or subtype.  A concept-profile page
corresponding to a concept node 204 may include, for example, a selectable "check in" icon (such as, for example, a clickable "check in" icon) or a selectable "add to favorites" icon.  Similarly, after a user clicks these icons, social-networking system
160 may create a "favorite" edge or a "check in" edge in response to a user's action corresponding to a respective action.  As another example and not by way of limitation, a user (user "C") may listen to a particular song ("Ramble On") using a
particular application (SPOTIFY, which is an online music application).  In this case, social-networking system 160 may create a "listened" edge 206 and a "used" edge (as illustrated in FIG. 2) between user nodes 202 corresponding to the user and concept
nodes 204 corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application.  Moreover, social-networking system 160 may create a "played" edge 206 (as illustrated in FIG. 2) between concept nodes 204
corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application.  In this case, "played" edge 206 corresponds to an action performed by an external application (SPOTIFY) on an external audio
file (the song "Imagine").  Although this disclosure describes particular edges 206 with particular attributes connecting user nodes 202 and concept nodes 204, this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges 206 with any suitable attributes connecting
user nodes 202 and concept nodes 204.  Moreover, although this disclosure describes edges between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 representing a single relationship, this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node 202 and a concept node 204
representing one or more relationships.  As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge 206 may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept.  Alternatively, another edge 206 may represent each type of relationship (or
multiples of a single relationship) between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 (as illustrated in FIG. 2 between user node 202 for user "E" and concept node 204 for "SPOTIFY").
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may create an edge 206 between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 in social graph 200.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user viewing a concept-profile page (such as, for
example, by using a web browser or a special-purpose application hosted by the user's client system 130) may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node 204 by clicking or selecting a "Like" icon, which may cause the user's
client system 130 to send to social-networking system 160 a message indicating the user's liking of the concept associated with the concept-profile page.  In response to the message, social-networking system 160 may create an edge 206 between user node
202 associated with the user and concept node 204, as illustrated by "like" edge 206 between the user and concept node 204.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may store an edge 206 in one or more data stores.  In particular
embodiments, an edge 206 may be automatically formed by social-networking system 160 in response to a particular user action.  As an example and not by way of limitation, if a first user uploads a picture, watches a movie, or listens to a song, an edge
206 may be formed between user node 202 corresponding to the first user and concept nodes 204 corresponding to those concepts.  Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges 206 in particular manners, this disclosure contemplates forming
any suitable edges 206 in any suitable manner.
<br/><br/> In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops (or edges) required to traverse the social graph from one node to the other.  A degree of separation between two nodes can be considered a
measure of relatedness between the users or the concepts represented by the two nodes in the social graph.
<br/><br/> The social-networking system may provide to a user frequently updated content based on recorded activities or actions that may be related to the user.  In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may support a news-feed service.  In
particular embodiments, a news feed may comprise a data format including one or more news-feed stories.  Each news-feed story may include content related to a specific subject matter or topic.  In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may
aggregate activities or actions related to a specific user action into a news-feed story.  For example, a first user may post a photo to the social-networking system, while other users of the social-networking system may perform various activities or
actions related to the photo.  Other users may "like" the photo, post comments related to the photo, or tag one or more particular users to the photo.  The social-networking system may aggregate activities related to the photo into a news-feed story
comprising an image of the photo, a profile picture of the first user, a count of "likes" of the photo by other users, and one or more comments related to the photo.  As for another example, a first user may check-in to a webpage (maintained by the
social-networking system or a third-party system) corresponding to a place (e.g., a landmark, a restaurant, a department store).  Other users of the social-networking system may "like" the check-in activity, or post comments related to the check-in
activity.  The social-networking system may aggregate activities related to the check-in activity into a news-feed story comprising a link and an image of the webpage, a profile picture of the first user, a count of "likes" of the check-in activity by
other users, and one or more comments related to the check-in activity.  The social-networking system may also aggregate into the news-feed story update to the webpage, or advertising related to the webpage (e.g., on-line coupons from a business related
to the webpage).  In particular embodiments, the social-networking may present a news feed including one or more news-feed stories to a viewing user.  For example, an application (e.g., a web browser) or an operation system hosted by a client device of
the viewing user may retrieve a news feed from the social-networking system and display the news feed in the application's user interface.  The application may display each news-feed story in the news feed in a respective frame (e.g., an Hypertext Markup
Language or HTML iFrame) in the application's user interface (or in the operating system's graphical user interface).
<br/><br/> The social-networking system may aggregate activities or actions into news-feed stories based on social-graph information.  For example, the social-networking system may aggregate for a viewing user a news feed including news-feed stories
related to activities or actions performed by users who are within a specified degree of separation (e.g., within two degrees of separation) from the viewing user on the social graph.  The social-networking system may aggregate activities or actions into
news-feed stories based on privacy settings.  For example, a user may specify which other users can access information of a particular activity performed by the user.  The social-networking system may aggregate for a viewing user a news feed including
news-feed stories related to activities accessible to the viewing user.
<br/><br/> An on-line service may provide services and data to users of the on-line service.  For example, as web-portal system may provide on-line services such as emails, games, shopping, news, weather forecast, stock quotes, sports scores, and so on. 
For another example, a social-networking website may provide on-line social-networking services such as wall posts, photo-sharing, event organization, messaging, games, or advertisements.  An on-line service may ask a user to register with the on-line
service with the on-line service to access services and data provided by the on-line service.  The on-line service may also ask the user to set up a user credential (e.g., a user identifier and a password) for authenticating the user to access the
on-line service.  The user may access the on-line service on a client computing device by providing the user credential at a log-in user interface (of the on-line service) displayed by the client computing device (e.g., a log-in web page displayed by a
web browser running on the client computing device).  The on-line service may determine how particular information associated with a particular user can be shared with another user of the on-line service based on a privacy setting for the particular
user.
<br/><br/> Users of an on-line service may share information or interact with each other over a local wireless network.  For example, a user of an on-line service may share his/her information (e.g., an email address, a phone number, a profile picture, and
so on) with another user nearby using a BLUETOOTH connection between the two user's BLUETOOTH-enabled mobile phones.  In particular embodiments, a group of people on a social-networking system may take pictures at a gathering, or event and share the
pictures or tag the attendees of the gathering in the pictures automatically, using BLUETOOTH or WiFi-Direct), or a peer-to-peer wireless connection, to establish the list of attendees automatically.  In particular embodiments, a group of individuals who
are in proximity communicate with ephemeral messaging.  The ephemeral messaging may be initiated automatically when users are in proximity with each other.  In particular embodiments, the list of users who mutually message each other may be generated
automatically based on a peer group.  Sharing information and interacting with other users over a local wireless network may enrich a user's experience with the on-line service.  However, information sharing over a local wireless network may not adhere
to privacy settings of the on-line service as data transmission over the local wireless network is often determined by physical proximity, not by privacy settings of the on-line service.  Even without privacy concerns, there may be no established method
to ensure that automatic group generation is done when several people in a room are participating in the same communication session and have known relationship to each other.  Plainly broadcasting information of a user of the on-line service over a local
wireless network may expose the information to people that are not allowed to access the information based on the user's privacy setting.  Particular embodiments describe methods for sharing information over a wireless connection while maintaining
wireless data privacy.  Particular embodiments may maintain wireless data privacy through an on-line service and without manual user input.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an example method 300 for maintaining wireless data privacy.  The method 300 may be implemented by one or more servers of a system providing an on-line service.  For example, the method 300 may be implemented by one or more
servers of a social-networking system.  The method 300 may begin at step 310.  In particular embodiments, at step 310, one or more servers of a system providing an on-line service may send a token to a first client computing device associated with a
first user of the on-line service.  The first user may be an individual or an entity (e.g., a business, a library, an application).  The first user may be any suitable object (e.g., a user, a concept) of a social-networking system as described earlier. 
The first client computing device may be a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a cellular phone, a smartphone, or any suitable client computing device associated with the first user.  The servers may send the token to the first client
computing device through a secured connection (e.g., based on Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure or HTTPS protocol, or Secure Sockets Layer or SSL protocol) between the first client computing device and the servers.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the servers may generate the token based at least in part on a user identifier of the first user.  For example, the servers may generate the token by encrypting the first user's user identifier of the on-line service. 
For example, the servers may encrypt the user identifier of the first user based on a one-time pad algorithm.  In other embodiments, the servers may generate a number (e.g., a random number, a sequence of random numbers) and send the number to the first
client computing device through a secured connection.  In particular embodiments, the servers may generate hashes of the user identifier of the first user (e.g., using SHA-256 hash algorithm).  In particular embodiments, the servers may provide sessions
keys to decrypt encrypted messages from a user.  The first client computing device may generate a token by encrypting the user identifier of the first user with the number (e.g., by using the number as an encryption key).  Particular embodiments
contemplate any suitable methods for generating the token based on the user identifier of the first user.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the token may be truncated and used as a MAC (Media Access Control) identifier within a physical wireless protocol.  Despite the use of a secured connection at the application layer (e.g., based on HTTPS or SSL
protocol), the MAC layer of Wi-Fi 802.11 and BLUETOOTH may utilize a static, unique 48-bit identifier (the MAC address).  This MAC address may be tracked in local wireless environments, perhaps compromising the location privacy of the first user.  Given
the collision probability within a limited user environment is small, it may be possible to use the token generated by the servers as the MAC address.  With reasonable token refresh rates, the location of the first user may be less likely traced.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the first client computing device may send the token through a wireless connection to a second client computing device associated with a second user of the on-line service.  The second user may be an individual or an
entity (e.g., a business, a library, an application).  The second user may be any suitable object (e.g., a user, a concept) of a social-networking system as described earlier.  The wireless connection may be based on a Wi-Fi, BLUETOOTH, peer-to-peer
cellular, near-field communication (NFC), infrared (IR), or Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) protocol.  The wireless connection may be encrypted or may not be encrypted.  In addition to being sent directly from the first client computing device to
the second client computing device, the token may be first sent to another client computing device associated with another user of the on-line service, and be relayed to the second client computing device by the other client computing device.  That is,
the wireless connection may further comprise a third client computing device associated with a third user of the on-line service.  The wireless connection may comprise a peer-to-peer network between a plurality of client computing devices, each being
associated with a user of the on-line service.  The token may be sent from the first client computing device to the second client computing device through the peer-to-peer network.  Particular embodiments contemplate any suitable methods for sending the
token from the first client computing device to the second client computing device through a wireless connection.  In particular embodiments, at step 320, the servers of the system providing the on-line service may receive the token from the second
client computing device associated with the second user of the on-line service.  The servers may also receive from the second client computing device a user identifier of the second user.  The token (and the second user's user identifier) may be sent
from the second client computing device to the servers through a secured connection.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, at step 330, the servers may verify the token based at least in part on the user identifier of the first user.  For example, the servers may decrypt the token and verify that the decrypted token matches the user
identifier of the first user.  In some embodiments, the token may expire after being verified by the servers.  That is, the token may be a one-time token (a "nonce").
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, at step 340, the servers may determine data accessible to the second user if the token is verified.  The servers may determine data accessible to the second user based on one or more privacy settings set by the first
user (or by the system providing the on-line service).  For example, the first user may create a list of users (e.g., a list of user identifiers of the on-line service) who have access to the first user's contact information (e.g., a phone number, an
email address, an instant messaging or IM user identifier, and so on).  By comparing the second user (e.g., the second user's user identifier) to the list, the servers may determine whether the first user's contact information is accessible to the second
user.
<br/><br/> For an on-line service such as a social-networking system, the servers may access a social graph of the social-networking system to verify the token.  The servers may verify the token further based on a least number of edges traversed in the
social graph from a first node corresponding to the first user and a second node corresponding to the second user (i.e., based on the degree of separation between the first and second nodes).  For example, the first user may set a privacy setting in that
only the first user's first and second-degree friends in the social graph can access the first user's information.  The servers may determine that the token is valid if the token is associated with the first user and if the second user is within two
degrees of separation from the first user on the social graph.  The servers may determine that the first user's information is accessible to the second user if the token is valid.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, at step 350, the servers may send to the second client computing device at least some of the data accessible to the second user.  For example, the servers may send to the second client computing device the first user's
user identifier of the on-line service.  The second client computing device may display the first user's user identifier in a graphical user interface running on the second client computing device, thus notifying the second user the presence of the first
user.  For another example, if the servers determine that the first user's contact information is accessible to the second user as described earlier, the servers may transmit some of the contact information (e.g., an email address) of the first user to
the second client computing device, causing the second client computing device to display the email address to the second user.  For yet another example, the servers may access the social graph described above for a list of common friends between the
first and second users of the social-networking system (e.g., users corresponding to nodes that each connects to a first node corresponding to the first user and a second node corresponding to the second user in the social graph).  The servers may send
the list of common friends to the second client computing device to be displayed to the second user.  The servers may also send the list of common friends to the first client computing device to be displayed to the first user.  The list of common friends
can be a "conversation breaker" between the first and second users (who are in close proximity in distance but are not first-degree friends yet in the social-networking system).
<br/><br/> In addition, the servers may send to the first client computing device information related to the second user.  For example, the servers may send to the first client computing device (thus the first user) a name and a profile picture of the
second user.
<br/><br/> If the token is verified, the servers may send to the second client computing device information related to an application associated with the first or second user.  For example, the servers may send to the second client computing device
information of a game application the first user is currently playing on the first client computing device (e.g., a link to the game application, a particular stage of the game application).  The second user may based on the information join the first
user in the game application (e.g., in the same game stage as the first user) from the second client computing device.  The servers may also cause a change in a state of an application running on the second client computing device.  For example, the
servers may send a message to the second client computing device, causing a news-feed application running on the second client computing device to re-order the display of news-feed stories such that stories related to the first user are placed on the top
of the news-feed displayed by the news-feed application.  For another example, the servers may send a message to the second client computing device, causing an address book application running on the second client computing device to display first (e.g.,
on top of a list of contacts) contact information of the first user.
<br/><br/> As described above, instead of plainly broadcasting information of the first user (e.g., a user identifier) over a wireless network, the first client computing device may first receive from the servers of the system providing the on-line service
a token associated with the first user, and send (broadcast) the token over a wireless connection to a second client computing device associated with a second user.  The second client computing device may then send the token to the servers of the system
providing the on-line service, causing the servers to verify that the token is associated with the first user.  The servers may then determine data accessible to the second user (if the token is valid), and send at least some of the data accessible to
the second user to the second client computing device.  Here, the generation, exchange, and verification of the token, the determination of the data accessible to the second user if the token is verified, and sending useful information (data accessible
to the second user) for consumption by the second user may happen in the background, without user manual input.  Moreover, after the token is verified by the servers, information sharing and interaction between the first and second client computing
devices (and between the first and second users) may be through the system providing the on-line service, not necessarily through the peer-to-peer wireless connection between the first and second client computing devices.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the servers may verify the token based on respective locations associated with the first and second client computing devices.  For example, if the second client computing device and the first client computing device are at
or near a home location of the first user, the servers may verify the token and determine that the second user can access information of the first user regardless privacy settings of the first user, since the second user is with the first user in the
first user's home and thus likely to be a trusted person to the first user.  Similarly, if the servers determines that the second client computing device is at or near a work location of the first user, the servers may verify the token and determine that
the second user can access information of the first user regardless privacy settings of the first user, since the second user is likely to be a trusted person to the first user.  The first (or second) client computing device may determine its location
based on Global Positioning System or GPS signals, cellular signal triangulation, Wi-Fi hotspot locations, or any suitable location positioning techniques, and transmit its location to the servers.  The servers may determine location information of the
first (or second) client computing device based on location check-in activities of the first (or second) user.  Particular embodiments contemplate any suitable methods for determining location information of the first and second client computing devices.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 (NEW) illustrates an example peer-to-peer network.  Mobile devices of three users 401, 402, and 403 are in physical proximity to each other, while communicating with each other through a peer-to-peer wireless communication protocol such
as WiFi Direct, BLUETOOTH, a cellular direct connection, or RFID.  Each mobile device of the 3 users receives a token from servers of the social-networking system based on the user's respective user identifier of the social-networking system.  The mobile
devices all trade tokens through each pairwise connection 404, 405, and 406, or through accumulation and communication of tokens via a smaller subset if the range of the communication protocol was limited.  The mobile devices send their respective
received tokens from other mobile devices to the social network for translation to a user identifier.  Users "A" 401 and "B" 402 are friends (407) on the social-networking system, and therefore each may receive the other person's information
automatically (for viewing) on their respective mobile devices.  Users "A" and "C" are not friends, but both have designated that shared connections to the same academic institution (could be a shared event or any similarly matched, academic,
professional or personal endeavor) would allow the sharing of their social-networking system information in the physical environment.  Due to their mutual attendance 409 and 410 at a school "Stanford" 408, the sharing of information could also be
automatic, but with additional context to note a shared connection not through friendship.  These two users could "friend" each other as a result of a meeting as they are in physical proximity.  Although users "B" and "C" are physically in proximity, but
having no immediate connections to each other on the social-networking system, their respective mobile devices do not indicate their mutual physical presence on their mobile devices due to their privacy settings on the social-networking system.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may repeat one or more steps of the method of FIG. 3, where appropriate.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of FIG. 3 as occurring in a particular order, this disclosure
