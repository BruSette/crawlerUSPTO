       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> Particular embodiments determine that a textual term is not associated
     with a known meaning. The textual term may be related to one or more
     users of the social-networking system. A determination is made as to
     whether the textual term should be added to a glossary. If so, then the
     textual term is added to the glossary. Information related to one or more
     textual terms in the glossary is provided to enhance auto-correction,
     provide predictive text input suggestions, or augment social graph data.
     Particular embodiments discover new textual terms by mining information,
     wherein the information was received from one or more users of the
     social-networking system, was generated for one or more users of the
     social-networking system, is marked as being associated with one or more
     users of the social-networking system, or includes an identifier for each
     of one or more users of the social-networking system.

<br/><br/> This disclosure generally relates to neologisms, in particular, generating a glossary of neologisms.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A social-networking system, which may include a social-networking website, may enable its users (such as persons or organizations) to interact with it and with each other through it.  The social-networking system may, with input from a user,
create and store in the social-networking system a user profile associated with the user.  The user profile may include demographic information, communication-channel information, and information on personal interests of the user.  The social-networking
system may also, with input from a user, create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social-networking system, as well as provide services (e.g. wall posts, photo-sharing, event organization, messaging, games, or
advertisements) to facilitate social interaction between or among users.  The social-networking system may transmit over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user.  A user may also
install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social-networking system.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments of a social-networking system mine information to learn neologisms and generate a social glossary.  As new textual terms are adopted by social-networking users and become commonplace, they may be incorporated into a
glossary for a user based on whether the usage context of the neologisms corresponds to the user's profile, e.g., locale, language, gender, age, group, profession, or other profile characteristics.  New textual terms may also be adopted based on user
polls (at large or within groups of social contacts).  Each new textual term may be required to exceed a certain usage threshold before it qualifies as a neologism and not a mistake.  The usage threshold may be determined based on usage by: users of the
social-networking system, users having a relationship with the user according to the social graph, users using the same language as the user, users located within the same geographic area as the user, users sharing a demographic category with the user,
or users sharing similar profile attributes with the user. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a flowchart of an example method according to particular embodiments.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an example social graph.

<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments analyze textual terms gathered by mining social-networking information, e.g., status updates, and other sources of information in order to learn neologisms and generate a social glossary.  As a new textual term is adopted,
it may be incorporated into a social glossary based on whether the usage context of the textual term corresponds to the user's profile, e.g., locale, language, gender, age, group, profession, or other profile characteristics.  New textual terms may also
be adopted based on user polls (at large or within groups of social contacts), suggestions, machine-learning based on user over-rides of auto-corrections, and by mining online sources of information.  Each new textual term may be required to exceed a
certain usage threshold before it qualifies as a neologism that may be added to the social glossary (and not a misspelling or typographical error).  The usage threshold may be determined based on usage by the general population, users of the
social-networking system, users having a relationship with the user according to the social graph, users using the same language as the user, users located within the same geographic area as the user, users sharing a demographic category with the user,
users sharing similar profile attributes with the user, or some other sub-group.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates example sources and uses for a social glossary.  A social glossary 100 may include one or more textual terms that have been determined to be neologisms.  For the purpose of this disclosure, a neologism may include any new word
or phrase that is in the process of being adopted or becoming known, including slang, terms of art, portmanteaus, syllabic abbreviations, abbreviations, acronyms, names, nicknames, re-purposed words or phrases, or any other type of coined word or phrase. Social glossary 100 may contain but is not primarily intended for words or phrases associated with meanings that are included in widely-available dictionaries, nor is social glossary 100 intended for common typographical errors or misspellings.
<br/><br/> Social glossary 100 may be generated based on multiple sources of potential new textual terms, wherein a source of information may provide not only new textual terms but also information related to usage context, user profile information for
users who have used or who are likely to use the new textual terms, definitions, synonyms, antonyms, etymology, etc. A source of information may explicitly indicate that a particular textual term should be added to social glossary 100, or it may provide
opportunities to detect potential new textual terms.  New textual terms may be added to social glossary on the basis of usage statistics, expert opinion, popular opinion, submission, attainment of a threshold for adoption, or any other conventional
method of determining that a new textual term should be added to a glossary.  The generation of a social glossary based on an information source is described in further detail with respect to FIG. 2.
<br/><br/> User-related sources of information 110 may include a number of different sources, such as, by way of example and not limitation, social information related to one or more users, communications involving users, suggestions submitted by users,
polls taken by users, or corrections entered by users.  The "users" discussed herein may be discussed in the context of a social-networking system; however, particular embodiments may be implemented in the context of any sort of user-based system (e.g.,
corporate system, organizational system).  Social graphs and related social-networking content are described in further detail with respect to FIG. 4 and corresponding text in the specification.  Social-networking systems are described in further detail
with respect to FIG. 4 and corresponding text in the specification.
<br/><br/> User-related sources of information may provide additional information with respect to context, since the user-based system may maintain user profiles for user accounts, as well as maintaining past communications and other information that may
enable context analysis and demographic analysis when a new textual term is detected.
<br/><br/> Social information may include information such as, by way of example and not limitation, status updates, comments on other users' content, tag information, OR messages accompanying other social actions (e.g., check-in).  Communications may
include user-to-user communications (e.g., emails, text messages, etc.) or broadcast-style communications originating with a user (e.g., TWEETS, bulletin board posts).  Corrections may include user input captured when a user overrides an auto-correction
of a term.
<br/><br/> User-associated online content includes any type of content that can be associated with a user.  Associations with a user may arise when content is generated or edited by a user, when content is posted by a user, when content is associated with
a user by a third-party (e.g., a friend tagging a user in a photo or posting), or when the content itself explicitly indicates that it is associated with a user (e.g., news story about a user).
<br/><br/> Suggestions may include submissions of new textual terms to add to social glossary 100.  In particular embodiments, the suggestion may include usage context information.  In particular embodiments, only suggestions from pre-screened individuals
(e.g., linguistic professors) may be accepted.
<br/><br/> Polls may provide a way to assess popular opinion as to whether or not to add a particular textual term to a social glossary 100.  The distribution group for invitations to participate in such a user poll may be determined on the basis of a
defined subgroup, e.g., users within a particular group, users having a particular affiliation with an organization, users sharing a particular interest, users within a particular locale, users falling into a particular demographic group, users speaking
or writing in a particular language, users connected to one or more social sub-networks, or users sharing any other type of characteristic.
<br/><br/> External sources of information 120 may include a number of different sources, such as, by way of example and not limitation, third-party websites, third-party submissions, and public communications.  Third-party websites may include any type of
website or network-accessible repository of content.  Particular embodiments may inspect third-party websites to determine whether new textual terms are being adopted.  Particular embodiments may also inspect metadata associated with the third-party
websites.  Public communications may include any type of public or published content, such as, by way of example announcement, press release, notice, blog, broadcast, etc.
<br/><br/> Social glossary 100 may then be used for a number of different purposes.  One use case may include suggesting predictive text 130.  For example, as user input is typed into an entry field, textual terms in social glossary 100 may be used to
perform partial string matching to provide predictive input suggestions.  Prediction of user input and display of typeahead results is discussed in further detail in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 12/763,132, filed on 19 Apr.  2010, titled
"Dynamically Generating Recommendations Based on Social Graph Information," and issued as U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,180,804 on 15 May 2012, and also in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 13/631,489, filed on Sep. 28, 2012, titled "Enhanced Predictive Input
Utilizing a Typeahead Process," both of which are incorporated herein by reference.  Another use case may include providing auto-correction 140.  Any conventional technology for providing auto-correction functionality may be used in conjunction with the
social glossary.  Another use case may include enhancing the social graph 160.  In particular embodiments, when a new textual term is added to social glossary 100, a determination may also be made that the new textual term qualifies to be added as a new
node, as a new edge type, or as an attribute of an existing node or edge type.
<br/><br/> For example, a particular textual term "Necomimi" may have been added to the social glossary as it began to appear on websites, blogs, status updates, and in photo and video tags.  If "Necomimi" was classified in the social glossary as a noun
related to a commercial product, a "Necomimi" concept node may be added to the social graph, in conjunction with, for example, links to websites associated with the product, links to social-networking users who have posted photos of video of themselves
wearing Necomimi ears, and a newsfeed of users' comments and status updates where "Necomimi" is mentioned.
<br/><br/> In another example, if a particular textual term "rickrolled" was added to the social glossary as a verb related to an action that one user can perform upon another user, a "rickrolling" edge type may be added to the social graph, so as to
capture such actions or activity when occurring between users of the social graph.
<br/><br/> In another example, if a particular textual term "blogger" was added to the social glossary as an adjective that can be applied to a user node with a known association to a blog, a "blogger" attribute may be added to user nodes in the social
graph who are determined to be associated with a particular blog, along with a link to the user's blog.
<br/><br/> Another use case may include providing a third-party interface 150.  The third-party interface may provide "pull" functionality for third-party systems to access social glossary 100 in order to retrieve new textual terms or "push" functionality
for particular embodiments to send new textual terms out to third-party systems.  In particular embodiments, third-party interface may also provide functionality for third-party systems to update or add to social glossary 100.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, third-party systems may "subscribe" to social glossary 100 in order to receive updates as new textual terms are added.  Such subscription-style functionality may be implemented in any conventional manner.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a flowchart of an example method for processing combining-character sequences for display on client devices.  Client devices are described in greater detail with respect to FIG. 6 and associated paragraphs in the specification.
<br/><br/> In step 210, particular embodiments discover one or more new textual terms.  In particular embodiments, particular embodiments may receive, host, or seek out sources of information from which new textual terms may be discovered.  Examples of
such sources of information are discussed in further detail with respect to FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> In step 220, particular embodiments determine that a textual term is not associated with a known meaning.  This determination may be made by comparing the textual term to existing dictionaries, existing glossaries (e.g., of slang terms, proper
names, etc.), or similar references.
<br/><br/> This determination may also be made on the basis of an analysis of the textual term to determine the usage context of the textual term.  For example, a parsing algorithm may analyze the usage context of the textual term and determine that
although the textual term has a known meaning as a proper noun, the textual term is now being used as a verb.  As one of skill in the art would be aware, any algorithm for performing natural language parsing may be used in conjunction with embodiments
disclosed herein.
<br/><br/> In step 230, particular embodiments determine that the textual term should be added to a glossary.  This determination may be made on the basis of one or more factors, including, by way of example and not limitation, usage statistics, expert
opinion, popular opinion, attainment of a threshold for adoption, or any other conventional method of determining that a new textual term should be added to a glossary.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a new textual term may be added once usage statistics for the term indicate that it is more than just a misspelling or typographical error.  Such usage statistics may be determined on the basis of a defined subgroup,
e.g., users within a particular group, users having a particular affiliation with an organization, users sharing a particular interest, users within a particular locale, users falling into a particular demographic group, users speaking or writing in a
particular language, users connected to one or more social sub-networks, or users sharing any other type of characteristic.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a new textual term may be identified by examining user overrides of auto-corrections or suggested spelling corrections, or by determining that particular users who rarely make spelling or typographical errors
consistently enter the new textual term with the same spelling.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a new textual term may be added on the basis of an "expert" opinion or submission.  For example, an expert in terminology as related to a particular area may submit a new term for addition to the social glossary (e.g.,
a submission from the scientists involved in the discovery of the buckminsterfullerene molecule to add "buckyball" to the social glossary as a synonym and nickname for "buckminsterfullerene").
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a new textual term may be added on the basis of popular opinion.  For example, results of a user poll may indicate that the new textual term should be added to the glossary.  The distribution group for invitations to
participate in such a user poll may be determined on the basis of a defined subgroup, e.g., users within a particular group, users having a particular affiliation with an organization, users sharing a particular interest, users within a particular
locale, users falling into a particular demographic group, users speaking or writing in a particular language, users connected to one or more social sub-networks, or users sharing any other type of characteristic.  Results of such a poll defined on a
subgroup-basis may provide correlating metadata information about profile characteristics of the polled group that can be associated with the new textual term.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a new textual term may be added on the basis of attainment of a threshold for adoption.  The threshold for adoption may be determined in any manner.  In one example, particular embodiments may require that the textual
term appear in a sufficient number of usage contexts so as to be able to derive certain information about the usage or meaning of the textual term.  In another example, particular embodiments may require that a textual term appear in a
sufficiently-diverse set of information sources so as to avoid simple propagation of cut-and-paste-type errors.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the determination of whether to add a new textual term to the social glossary may be managed entirely or in part by an administrator who can evaluate one or more of the above-described and any additional factors.
<br/><br/> In step 240, particular embodiments may add the textual term to the social glossary.  Upon adding the textual term to the social glossary, particular embodiments may update other related tables, data stores, systems, pages, functionality, or
third-party systems, such as, by way of example and not limitation: updating an index for a database table that facilitates rapid access to textual terms in the social glossary; updating an index or database table associated with popular new terms for
the purpose of presenting suggestions based on predictive text input; updating an index or database table associated with commonly-misspelled terms for the purpose of providing auto-correction functionality; pushing social glossary updates to third-party
systems that have subscribed to the social glossary (as described in further detail with respect to FIG. 1); creating nodes or edge types in a social graph (as described in further detail with respect to FIG. 1); or adding attribute information to
existing nodes or edges in a social graph (as described in further detail with respect to FIG. 1).
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may store a textual term in association with related information.  In particular embodiments, a textual term may be associated with metadata or other information related to the textual term.  Examples of metadata or other
information include but are not limited to: a classification under a particular lexical category as a noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, interjection, etc.; a definition, synonym(s), antonym(s), example and/or typical usage
context(s), alternate spelling(s); one or more particular oral or written language designations; a particular locale; profile information for known or typical users of the textual term (e.g., age, gender, profession, education, interest(s), demographic
element(s), connection to particular social sub-networks, affiliation with one or more groups or organizations); or a temporal, geo-spatial, or social pattern of adoption.  Such a pattern of adoption may be determined by tracking usage context for the
textual term as adoption becomes more widespread.
<br/><br/> In step 250, particular embodiments may provide glossary information for social-networking functions and third-party systems.  As described in further detail with respect to FIG. 1, particular embodiments may provide support for general
functionality, such as suggestions of predictive text input and provision of auto-corrections, which may be provided either for internal use with respect to a social-networking system or for external use by third-party systems.  Particular embodiments
may also provide enhancements to the social graph based on the social glossary.  Finally, particular embodiments may provide a more generalized third-party interface to add to and update the social glossary, e.g., by using an API.
<br/><br/> In step 260, particular embodiments may receive feedback regarding a textual term in the social glossary.  Affirmative feedback may be received in the form of additional information received or detected that supports the addition of the textual
term to the social glossary or related metadata or other information.  Negative feedback may indicate that the textual term is simply a misspelling or typographical error, or that it has become obsolete and is no longer in common use or even disfavored.
<br/><br/> In step 270, particular embodiments may remove or flag obsolete textual terms in the social glossary.  Determination that a textual term is obsolete may be made in any manner, including techniques related to those described above with respect to
step 230.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates example social graph 300.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 460 may store one or more social graphs 300 in one or more data stores.  In particular embodiments, social graph 300 may include multiple
nodes--which may include multiple user nodes 302 or multiple concept nodes 304--and multiple edges 306 connecting the nodes.  Example social graph 300 illustrated in FIG. 3 is shown, for didactic purposes, in a two-dimensional visual map representation. 
In particular embodiments, a social-networking system 460, client system 430, or third-party system 470 may access social graph 300 and related social-graph information for suitable applications.  The nodes and edges of social graph 300 may be stored as
data objects, for example, in a data store (such as a social-graph database).  Such a data store may include one or more searchable or queryable indexes of nodes or edges of social graph 300.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a user node 302 may correspond to a user of social-networking system 460.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third-party
application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over social-networking system 460.  In particular embodiments, when a user registers for an account with social-networking system 460, social-networking
system 460 may create a user node 302 corresponding to the user, and store the user node 302 in one or more data stores.  Users and user nodes 302 described herein may, where appropriate, refer to registered users and user nodes 302 associated with
registered users.  In addition or as an alternative, users and user nodes 302 described herein may, where appropriate, refer to users that have not registered with social-networking system 460.  In particular embodiments, a user node 302 may be
associated with information provided by a user or information gathered by various systems, including social-networking system 460.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may provide his or her name, profile picture, contact information,
birth date, sex, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, or other demographic information.  In particular embodiments, a user node 302 may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to
information associated with a user.  In particular embodiments, a user node 302 may correspond to one or more webpages or one or more user-profile pages (which may be webpages).
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a concept node 304 may correspond to a concept.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a concept may correspond to a place (such as, for example, a movie theater, restaurant, landmark, or city); a website (such
as, for example, a website associated with social-network system 460 or a third-party website associated with a web-application server); an entity (such as, for example, a person, business, group, sports team, or celebrity); a resource (such as, for
example, an audio file, video file, digital photo, text file, structured document, or application) which may be located within social-networking system 460 or on an external server, such as a web-application server; real or intellectual property (such
as, for example, a sculpture, painting, movie, game, song, idea, photograph, or written work); a game; an activity; an idea or theory; another suitable concept; or two or more such concepts.  A concept node 304 may be associated with information of a
concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems, including social-networking system 460.  As an example and not by way of limitation, information of a concept may include a name or a title; one or more images (e.g., an image of the
cover page of a book); a location (e.g., an address or a geographical location); a website (which may be associated with a URL); contact information (e.g., a phone number or an email address); other suitable concept information; or any suitable
combination of such information.  In particular embodiments, a concept node 304 may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node 304.  In particular embodiments, a concept node 304 may correspond
to a webpage.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a node in social graph 300 may represent or be represented by a webpage (which may be referred to as a "profile page").  Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social-networking system 460.  Profile pages may
also be hosted on third-party websites associated with a third-party server 470.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may
correspond to a particular concept node 304.  Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user node 302 may have a corresponding user-profile page in which the corresponding
user may add content, make declarations, or otherwise express himself or herself.  As another example and not by way of limitation, a concept node 304 may have a corresponding concept-profile page in which one or more users may add content, make
declarations, or express themselves, particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node 304.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a concept node 304 may represent a third-party webpage or resource hosted by a third-party system 470.  The third-party webpage or resource may include, among other elements, content, a selectable or other icon, or
other inter-actable object (which may be implemented, for example, in JavaScript, AJAX, or PHP codes) representing an action or activity.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a third-party webpage may include a selectable icon such as "like,"
"check in," "eat," "recommend," or another suitable action or activity.  A user viewing the third-party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons (e.g., "eat"), causing a client system 430 to transmit to social-networking system 460 a
message indicating the user's action.  In response to the message, social-networking system 460 may create an edge (e.g., an "eat" edge) between a user node 302 corresponding to the user and a concept node 304 corresponding to the third-party webpage or
resource and store edge 306 in one or more data stores.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a pair of nodes in social graph 300 may be connected to each other by one or more edges 306.  An edge 306 connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes.  In particular embodiments,
an edge 306 may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a first user may indicate that a second user is a "friend" of the first
user.  In response to this indication, social-networking system 460 may transmit a "friend request" to the second user.  If the second user confirms the "friend request," social-networking system 460 may create an edge 306 connecting the first user's
user node 302 to the second user's user node 302 in social graph 300 and store edge 306 as social-graph information in one or more of data stores 24.  In the example of FIG. 3, social graph 300 includes an edge 306 indicating a friend relation between
user nodes 302 of user "A" and user "B" and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes 302 of user "C" and user "B." Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges 306 with particular attributes connecting particular user
nodes 302, this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges 306 with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes 302.  As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge 306 may represent a friendship, family relationship, business or employment
relationship, fan relationship, follower relationship, visitor relationship, subscriber relationship, superior/subordinate relationship, reciprocal relationship, non-reciprocal relationship, another suitable type of relationship, or two or more such
relationships.  Moreover, although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected, this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected.  Herein, references to users or concepts being connected may, where appropriate, refer
to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph 300 by one or more edges 306.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, an edge 306 between a user node 302 and a concept node 304 may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node 302 toward a concept associated with a concept node 304.  As an
example and not by way of limitation, as illustrated in FIG. 3, a user may "like," "attended," "played," "listened," "cooked," "worked at," or "watched" a concept, each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype.  A concept-profile page
corresponding to a concept node 304 may include, for example, a selectable "check in" icon (such as, for example, a clickable "check in" icon) or a selectable "add to favorites" icon.  Similarly, after a user clicks these icons, social-networking system
460 may create a "favorite" edge or a "check in" edge in response to a user's action corresponding to a respective action.  As another example and not by way of limitation, a user (user "C") may listen to a particular song ("Imagine") using a particular
application (SPOTIFY, which is an online music application).  In this case, social-networking system 460 may create a "listened" edge 306 and a "used" edge (as illustrated in FIG. 3) between user nodes 302 corresponding to the user and concept nodes 304
corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application.  Moreover, social-networking system 460 may create a "played" edge 306 (as illustrated in FIG. 3) between concept nodes 304 corresponding
to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application.  In this case, "played" edge 306 corresponds to an action performed by an external application (SPOTIFY) on an external audio file (the song
"Imagine").  Although this disclosure describes particular edges 306 with particular attributes connecting user nodes 302 and concept nodes 304, this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges 306 with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes 302
and concept nodes 304.  Moreover, although this disclosure describes edges between a user node 302 and a concept node 304 representing a single relationship, this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node 302 and a concept node 304 representing
one or more relationships.  As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge 306 may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept.  Alternatively, another edge 306 may represent each type of relationship (or multiples of a
single relationship) between a user node 302 and a concept node 304 (as illustrated in FIG. 3 between user node 302 for user "E" and concept node 304 for "SPOTIFY").
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 460 may create an edge 306 between a user node 302 and a concept node 304 in social graph 300.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user viewing a concept-profile page (such as, for
example, by using a web browser or a special-purpose application hosted by the user's client system 430) may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node 304 by clicking or selecting a "Like" icon, which may cause the user's
client system 430 to transmit to social-networking system 460 a message indicating the user's liking of the concept associated with the concept-profile page.  In response to the message, social-networking system 460 may create an edge 306 between user
node 302 associated with the user and concept node 304, as illustrated by "like" edge 306 between the user and concept node 304.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 460 may store an edge 306 in one or more data stores.  In particular
embodiments, an edge 306 may be automatically formed by social-networking system 460 in response to a particular user action.  As an example and not by way of limitation, if a first user uploads a picture, watches a movie, or listens to a song, an edge
306 may be formed between user node 302 corresponding to the first user and concept nodes 304 corresponding to those concepts.  Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges 306 in particular manners, this disclosure contemplates forming
any suitable edges 306 in any suitable manner.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates an example network environment 400 associated with a social-networking system.  Network environment 400 includes a client system 430, a social-networking system 460, and a third-party system 470 connected to each other by a
