<br/><br/> 1.  Field of the Invention
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to interactive multi-player games, specifically to a system and method for providing a multi-player game experience.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of the Related Art
<br/><br/> Amusement parks and theme parks are terms for a group of entertainment attractions, rides, and other events in a location for the enjoyment of large numbers of people.  An amusement park is more elaborate than a simple city park or playground,
usually providing attractions meant to cater specifically to certain age groups, as well as some that are aimed towards all ages.  Theme parks, a specific type of amusement park, are usually much more intricately themed to a certain subject or group of
subjects than normal amusement parks.
<br/><br/> A theme park has landscaping, buildings, and attractions that are based on one or more specific themes or stories.  Despite many older parks adding themed rides and areas, qualifying the park as a theme park, the first park built with the
original intension of promoting a specific theme.  Mechanized thrill machines are a defining feature of amusement parks.  Earliest rides include the carousel which was originally developed as a way of practicing and then showing-off expertise at
tournament skills such as riding and spearing the ring.
<br/><br/> Some improvements have been made in the field.  Examples of references related to the present invention are described below in their own words, and the supporting teachings of each reference are incorporated by reference herein:
<br/><br/> U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,967,566, issued to Weston et al., discloses an interactive treasure hunt game is provided.  Game participants receive a card, map and/or identification badge configured with an RFID tag, bar-code or a magnetic "swipe" strip or
the like.  The RFID tag or other identifying device is used to store certain information identifying each play participant and/or describing certain powers or abilities possessed by an imaginary character that the card may represent.  Players advance in
the game by finding clues and solving various puzzles presented by the game.  Players may also gain (or lose) certain attributes, such as magic skills, magic strength, fighting ability, various spell-casting abilities, etc. All of this information is
preferably stored on the RFID tag or card so that the character attributes may be easily and conveniently transported to other similarly-equipped play facilities, computer games, video games, home game consoles, hand-held game units, and the like.  In
this manner, the game can seamlessly transcend from one play environment and/or entertainment medium to the next.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,396,281, issued to Mendelsohn et al., discloses a system of interaction between an electronic theme park experience and
live theme park interaction and activity earns rewards.  The interaction permits for rewards earned in the electronic theme park experience to be redeemed in the live theme park experience and vice versa.  The electronic theme park and live activity are
interactive in real or delayed time through an Internet connection.  Activities on one or both of the live and electronic formats are designed to drive increased player visiting of the live and/or electronic versions.  The Virtual Magic Kingdom is a
virtual version of Disney's theme parks, specifically the "Magic Kingdom" portion of the theme parks.
<br/><br/> U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,014,768, issued to Ackley, discloses a system and method is provided for remotely controlling and interacting with a multimedia device using a mobile phone.  This is accomplished by utilizing cell and mobile phones capable of
establishing persistent Internet connections.  A software application is provided for the mobile phone which receives inputs entered by a user on the mobile phone's keypad and translates the inputs into commands that are recognized by a multimedia
device.  For example, the multimedia device may be a television, set top box, or a digital video recorder such as a Tivo or ReplayTV.  The software application transmits the data input by the user to the device, either directly, or through at least one
central server.  Mapping of the commands entered on the mobile phone into commands recognized by the remote device may occur on the phone, at a central server, or at the device itself.
<br/><br/> U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,955,168, issued to Mendelsohn et al., discloses an amusement system has a first path extending through an amusement attraction.  Vehicles moving along the path have simulated weapons.  Riders in the vehicles shoot at targets
along the paths or on the vehicles.  A game play system allows remote players to participate in a concurrent simulation of an amusement park or theme park ride, activity or event as the amusement park or theme park ride, activity or event is occurring. 
The system gathers input from sensors located at the amusement park or theme park ride or activity or event, preprocesses this input, and transfers it to a computer system, which uses this input to create a concurrent simulation of the amusement park or
theme park ride or activity or event.  A remote game player can then interact with the concurrent simulation by providing input to the concurrent simulation through a user interface.  This system combines the excitement of a highly interactive video game
with the amusement park or theme park ride or activity or event.  Remote game players may additionally compete against each other.
<br/><br/> U.S.  Patent Application Publication No.: 2008/0274808, by Walker et al., discloses a method and system is provided wherein an event experienced by a player is documented and the documentation of the event is stored (e.g., in association with an
indication of the event).  One example of an event experienced by a player is an outcome obtained by a player on a gaming device.  In such an embodiment the documentation of the event may comprise an image of the player's reaction to the outcome and/or a
still or video image of the outcome.  In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention a player may subsequently access (e.g., purchase) an output of the documentation.  In one embodiment an outcome of a prior game play that was documented is
replayed.  When the outcome of the prior game play is output, the outcome may be output in a manner that indicates to a viewer that the outcome is an outcome of a prior game play and not an outcome of a current game play.
<br/><br/> The inventions heretofore known suffer from a number of disadvantages which include, but are not limited to: being limited in use, being limited in application, being limited in interactivity, being limited is adaptability, being limited in
playability, excluding some demographics (especially women and older adults), providing inappropriate content, requiring extensive computer skills/knowledge to use/play, limiting the ability of users to continue to re-play games, restricting games/rides
to a particular genre, failing to provide game interaction between children and adults, failing to provide translatable experiences between gamers, failing to provide translatable virtual objects between players, limiting customized game experiences to
single player experiences, requiring programming knowledge, requiring consistent game experiences, failing to meaningfully involve ride facilitators in the game experience, and the like.
<br/><br/> What is needed is a system and method for providing a multi-player game experience that solves one or more of the problems described herein and/or one or more problems that may come to the attention of one skilled in the art upon becoming
familiar with this specification.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the drawing(s), and specific language will be used to describe the same.  It will
nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.  Any alterations and further modifications of the inventive features illustrated herein, and any additional applications of the principles of the invention
as illustrated herein, which would occur to one skilled in the relevant art and having possession of this disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the invention.
<br/><br/> Many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence.  For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising
custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components.  A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable
array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.
<br/><br/> Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors.  An identified module of programmable or executable code may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which
may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, or function.  Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which, when joined
logically together, comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.
<br/><br/> Indeed, a module and/or a program of executable code may be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices.  Similarly,
operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure.  The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be
distributed over different locations including over different storage devices, and may exist, at least partially, merely as electronic signals on a system or network.
<br/><br/> The various system components and/or modules discussed herein may include one or more of the following: a host server or other computing systems including a processor for processing digital data; a memory coupled to said processor for storing
digital data; an input digitizer coupled to the processor for inputting digital data; an application program stored in said memory and accessible by said processor for directing processing of digital data by said processor; a display device coupled to
the processor and memory for displaying information derived from digital data processed by said processor; and a plurality of databases.  As those skilled in the art will appreciate, any computers discussed herein may include an operating system (e.g.,
Windows Vista, NT, 95/98/2000, OS2; UNIX; Linux; Solaris; MacOS; and etc.) as well as various conventional support software and drivers typically associated with computers.  The computers may be in a home or business environment with access to a network. In an exemplary embodiment, access is through the Internet through a commercially-available web-browser software package.
<br/><br/> The present invention may be described herein in terms of functional block components, screen shots, user interaction, optional selections, various processing steps, and the like.  Each of such described herein may be one or more modules in
exemplary embodiments of the invention.  It should be appreciated that such functional blocks may be realized by any number of hardware and/or software components configured to perform the specified functions.  For example, the present invention may
employ various integrated circuit components, e.g., memory elements, processing elements, logic elements, look-up tables, and the like, which may carry out a variety of functions under the control of one or more microprocessors or other control devices. 
Similarly, the software elements of the present invention may be implemented with any programming or scripting language such as C, C++, Java, COBOL, assembler, PERL, Visual Basic, SQL Stored Procedures, AJAX, extensible markup language (XML), with the
various algorithms being implemented with any combination of data structures, objects, processes, routines or other programming elements.  Further, it should be noted that the present invention may employ any number of conventional techniques for data
transmission, signaling, data processing, network control, and the like.  Still further, the invention may detect or prevent security issues with a client-side scripting language, such as JavaScript, VBScript or the like.
<br/><br/> Additionally, many of the functional units and/or modules herein are described as being "in communication" with other functional units and/or modules.  Being "in communication" refers to any manner and/or way in which functional units and/or
modules, such as, but not limited to, computers, laptop computers, PDAs, modules, and other types of hardware and/or software, may be in communication with each other.  Some non-limiting examples include communicating, sending, and/or receiving data and
metadata via: a network, a wireless network, software, instructions, circuitry, phone lines, internet lines, satellite signals, electric signals, electrical and magnetic fields and/or pulses, and/or so forth.
<br/><br/> As used herein, the term "network" may include any electronic communications means which incorporates both hardware and software components of such.  Communication among the parties in accordance with the present invention may be accomplished
through any suitable communication channels, such as, for example, a telephone network, an extranet, an intranet, Internet, point of interaction device (point of sale device, personal digital assistant, cellular phone, kiosk, etc.), online
communications, off-line communications, wireless communications, transponder communications, local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), networked or linked devices and/or the like.  Moreover, although the invention may be implemented with TCP/IP
communications protocols, the invention may also be implemented using IPX, Appletalk, IP-6, NetBIOS, OSI or any number of existing or future protocols.  If the network is in the nature of a public network, such as the Internet, it may be advantageous to
presume the network to be insecure and open to eavesdroppers.  Specific information related to the protocols, standards, and application software utilized in connection with the Internet is generally known to those skilled in the art and, as such, need
not be detailed herein.  See, for example, DILIP NAIK, INTERNET STANDARDS AND PROTOCOLS (1998); JAVA 2 COMPLETE, various authors, (Sybex 1999); DEBORAH RAY AND ERIC RAY, MASTERING HTML 4.0 (1997); and LOSHIN, TCP/IP CLEARLY EXPLAINED (1997), the contents
of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
<br/><br/> Reference throughout this specification to an "embodiment," an "example" or similar language means that a particular feature, structure, characteristic, or combinations thereof described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least
one embodiment of the present invention.  Thus, appearances of the phrases an "embodiment," an "example," and similar language throughout this specification may, but do not necessarily, all refer to the same embodiment, to different embodiments, or to
one or more of the figures.  Additionally, reference to the wording "embodiment," "example" or the like, for two or more features, elements, etc. does not mean that the features are necessarily related, dissimilar, the same, etc.
<br/><br/> Each statement of an embodiment, or example, is to be considered independent of any other statement of an embodiment despite any use of similar or identical language characterizing each embodiment.  Therefore, where one embodiment is identified
as "another embodiment," the identified embodiment is independent of any other embodiments characterized by the language "another embodiment." The features, functions, and the like described herein are considered to be able to be combined in whole or in
part one with another as the claims and/or art may direct, either directly or indirectly, implicitly or explicitly.
<br/><br/> As used herein, "comprising," "including," "containing," "is," "are," "characterized by," and grammatical equivalents thereof are inclusive or open-ended terms that do not exclude additional unrecited elements or method steps.  "Comprising" is
to be interpreted as including the more restrictive terms "consisting of" and "consisting essentially of."
<br/><br/> The words "rider," "user," "player," and the like are used synonymously herein and are intended to mean an individual participating in a game experience.
<br/><br/> As used herein, the words "object" and "game object" refer to modules that may be created using object-oriented programming and/or languages that permit the same, but not necessarily.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a system and method for providing a multi-player game experience, according to one embodiment of the invention.  There is shown a plurality of various types of people (disparate people) 12 waiting in line to play
a multi-player game experience through a computerized theme park ride 10.  The people are participating in coordinated but disparate game experiences that are customized to reflect their particular circumstances and/or characteristics.  Further, those
waiting to fully participate in the experience (those waiting in line outside the illustrated enclosure) are able to participate to a degree in their experience and in the experiences of others to which they have some connection.
<br/><br/> People 12, such as those illustrated, are of different combinations of age, gender, nationality, cultural background, religion, belief systems, family relationships, associations with others, group membership status, and etc. Accordingly, their
needs and wants with respect to entertainment are disparate, different in kind.  However, the desire to experience challenge, excitement, achievement, and etc. is substantially universal to the human experience, even if expressed to varying degrees by
individuals.
<br/><br/> Further, the desire to: collaborate, coordinate, form groups, play together, and etc. is also substantially universal, even if expressed to varying degrees by individuals.  Therefore, groups of people and individuals visit theme parks in an
effort to satisfy those universal desires.  But, satisfaction of those desires is limited by the theme park's ability to provide a broad spectrum of interesting activities and further limited by the density to which such a park may deploy such resources. Thus, there are necessarily times and places where the specific desires of specific individuals within the group of visitors are not having a positive or fulfilling experience.
<br/><br/> The present invention includes a system and a method for providing a multi-player game experience that is coordinated between the players yet disparate in the presentation thereof 10.  Accordingly, those factors (game operations/mechanics) which
drive fulfillment of the wants and needs that are substantially similar across individuals are provided in a manner that is substantially similar, while those factors (game media or cosmetic) which are substantially different between individuals may be
presented in a different manner without interfering with operation of the game mechanics.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a system and method for providing a multi-player game experience, according to one embodiment of the invention.  There is shown a pair of players 14 playing a coordinated multi-player game experience through a
computerized theme park ride 10.  The illustrated pair of players 14 are separated by a media blocking structure/device 16, in the illustration a simple wall the blocks line of sight between the players.  Further, the actual screen representation of game
objects for each player is substantially similar with regards to the operation/playing of the game, but the graphical elements are cosmetically different.  In the illustrated example, the screen of the girl shows a bunny, while the screen of the boy
shows a stylized monster.
<br/><br/> As a non-limiting example, the two players may be playing a multiplayer first person shooter game using a single game engine, such as but not limited to the first-person shooter game engines including and/or similar to Unreal Engine 3 by Epic
Games of Cary N.C., Dunia Engine by Kirmaan Aboobaker, CryEngine 2 by Crytek of Frankfurt Germany and/or the Source engine by Valve Corporation of Bellevue Wash.  In the illustration, the players are playing a game wherein the view control and position
of the players in the game environment is either scripted (out of control of the players) or otherwise locked so that the players experience substantially the same view positions and orientations throughout game-play.  Further, actions that the players
take towards game objects (generally towards game objects on the screen) may result in creation, destruction, and/or transformation of game objects during the game experience.  This creation, destruction, and/or transformation of game objects is
generally experienced, in one way or another, by both players regardless of which player triggers the change.
<br/><br/> In one non-limiting example, one player may target and strike a game object, which may cause the game object to transform into a new game object for a time and then be removed.  In the case of the boy's screen, this may result in a monster
exploding with gore and then the game object being removed as the image of the monster fades or falls out of view.  That exact same moment, the girl's screen may show a rescue ray transporting the bunny to a place of safety, the bunny eventually being
removed as a game object and no longer being displayed on the screen.  Accordingly, an older brother and younger sister may play the exact same game (as far as game mechanics are concerned) while having vastly different sensory experiences that are
customized to their specific characteristics/circumstances.  In this example, the players are experiencing substantially different cosmetic experiences, but the game mechanics are substantially the same (not clearly perceptibly different between players)
and the experience is also coordinated in that the outcome (win, lose, high score, low score, progression through levels, etc.) and process for achieving that outcome are substantially related, and in the case of the described game, substantially the
same.
<br/><br/> In general, a difference between a game media and game operations is that game media is experienced by the player but does not substantially influence the operation of the game so that a game may progress in a still coordinated and/or still
synchronized manner despite differences in game media experienced by players, while game operations do substantially influence operation of the game and variations in game operation will substantially later the game so that the game is no longer still
coordinated and/or synchronized.  It is desirable that groups of players be able to face and overcome challenges together and have a group experience of success and/or failure while receiving a customized sensory experience for each player that is suited
to their characteristics.  This allows people with huge differences in their backgrounds, life experiences, positions in life, relationships, issues, problems, taboos, moral standards, and etc. to play together without those differences playing a
significant role in the combined experience.
<br/><br/> While the illustrated example relates to first-person shooter games, and specifically to a particular kind of first-person shooter game, such an experience may be provided in a great variety of game types, including but not limited to
computerized: first person shooters, strategy games, puzzle games, simulators, board games, role-playing games, games of chance, educational games, party games, war-games and the like and combinations thereof.  The experience may also be present in
computerized games that are cooperative player versus computer, cooperative player versus player, full player versus player, and the like and combinations thereof.  Additionally, the game interfaces and roles played by each player and the actual game
mechanics experienced by each player may be may be substantially different while still being a coordinated game.
<br/><br/> As a non-limiting example, Player A may be playing a role as a sniper and may experience the game as a 1950s hostage crisis where Player A is required to "shoot the bad guys" that appear as Player B flushes them out of their hiding locations in
the sewers.  Meanwhile Player B may be playing a role as a mole (the animal) digging through a psychedelic styled underground tunnel system and pushing vegetables up out of the way (which appear as "bad guys" to Player A) and avoiding steel stakes that
appear (the missed shots of Player A).  The interface for Player A may be operated according to a selection for "mild" interface feedback, while the interface for Player B may be operated according to a selection for "severe" interface feedback.  Thus,
the recoil generated by the system for Player A to experience at each shot may be slight or merely a represented by a sound; while, Player B colliding with a vegetable may be expressed by the system with strong action from a motor coupled to Player B's
chair.  Accordingly, the players have synchronized and coordinated game-play while having meaningfully different game experiences, roles, interfaces, and sensory experiences.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, this may be accomplished by dynamically setting game object characteristics that are typically fixed and by permitting game object characteristics to be pluralized, such as but not limited to pluralized according to the number
of players.  In particular, game objects generally have associated media files (skins, sounds, names, descriptions, motor control script, etc.) that are called by the system as needed to be displayed/played/run/etc. for the user at the appropriate times. Such game objects may include media file indexes, pointers, or other tools for instructing a system to call a particular file.  Wherein a system, during initialization of the game or during game play, is able to interact with the game object in a manner
that the player and/or the player's setting/characteristic/media selection/etc. is communicated between the game object and the system, the system may then be given sufficient instructions to find the relevant media file to display/play/run/etc.
<br/><br/> In another non-limiting example, the game object may be as typical, but instead of "pointing" to a media file, there may be a media library that may be indicated and the player selection may be retrieved using a query of the media library.  In
particular, the game object, instead of pointing to an image file that includes all the information needed to create the "skin" of the game object, the game object may point to an image library that includes a great variety of "skins" that have
searchable characteristics, including but not limited to presence of gore, adult rating, applicable genre, colors included, color scheme, style, and etc. Accordingly, either during game initialization (to speed game play) and/or during game-play (to
permit in-game changes) the system may query the library using one or more search characteristics to obtain one or more suitable media files to be used.  Where multiple media files are retrieved, there may be one or more rules, automatic settings,
structured/random processes, and/or the like and/or combinations thereof for selecting a single file or for using multiple files together.  As a non-limiting example, the system may randomly select an appropriate file or may select a file that has common
characteristics with another previously selected file.
<br/><br/> Further, while some game objects are merely created/destroyed during the game, some game objects may become virtual possessions or characteristics associated with player accounts.  Accordingly, the expression of these objects may continue to be
variable and based on selections by the player and or characteristics of the player as recorded in their user accounts.  A particular expression may persist or may transform on acquisition or transfer of the object.  As a non-limiting example, Player A
earns a silver badge of honor playing a cowboy-styled game.  This badge may remain as a silver badge outside the game experience or it may be expressed as a holograph-style multicolored trophy because the default style setting for that particular player
may be set to futuristic styles.  The badge object may retain information (or information of the original graphic/style setting may be otherwise retained by the system) about its original expression even after transformation to a newer setting.  If the
badge object (then expressed as a trophy) is later transferred to another player, the badge object may retain its present expression (trophy), may revert to a previous expression (silver badge), or may transform to a new expression if the recipient
"chooses" (either by a default setting, an actual selection by the player, or a characteristic of the account that the player may have no control over) to an expression such as but not limited to a red daisy that may be placed in a virtual garden "owned"
by the player.  It may be that some expressions are only possible to achieve through transformations of game objects.  As a non-limiting example, the red daisy expressed game object may only be possible to select to express if specific requirements are
met (on transfer only, on second or higher transformation only, only if transforming from a particular genre/style to another particular genre/style, on combination of objects, and etc., and combinations thereof).  Accordingly, there may be one or more
rules, scripts, etc. that may define possible expressions and it may be that selections are possible only within the defined rules for expression.
<br/><br/> In this application, the ability of the system to select between difference media expressions is discussed.  Such selections may be based on direct user input (offer the user choices and select based on input from user through an interface
device); based on characteristics of a user account that are not changeable by the user (age limited rating selections, game progression, etc.); characteristics of a user account that are changeable by the user (genre preferences, color scheme
preferences, background music preferences, etc.); based on selections made by a ride facilitator (employee of the theme park who may have control over particular aspects of the game experience and such control may be variable from employee to employee
and may be earned based on game-play by the employee or based on other factors such as job performance, time employed, and etc. such that players may only be able to experience certain sensory experiences when a particular employee/facilitator is
operating the game, thereby creating "celebrity" employees); based on group characteristics (average or most prevalent user defaults among a group, average or highest voted selection for a group, specific hard-set preference of a group, etc.) wherein a
group may be a guild, family, business, set of players playing a specific game or group of games, group identified by a specific characteristic (for example a player may indicate that they belong to a particular religion or other group and the group
leader may they be enabled to make specific default selections for the members of the group that the group members may or may not be able to override--thus users may be free to make selections knowing that the group standards are pre-enforced, wherein
forbidden selections may not even be offered or visible to members of the group); and etc. Selections by one group or individual (player, game facilitator, group leader, etc.) may automatically increase and/or decrease selection opportunities, lists,
options, and etc. by other groups or individuals.  As a non-limiting example, a particular theme park employee (and/or player, group, etc.) may be the only account(s) that can enable other players to select a branded set of game media for a particular
game/ride and special events may be hosted by the theme park and/or the owner of the associated brand.  Specifically implemented, there may be a sports themed night where game media associated with a particular sports team brand may be available for
selection by players because of the presence of a particular person/group in the theme park.  On other nights that specific person/group may still play without selecting to allow other players to access that media.
<br/><br/> Such selections may be made through a device remote from the game/ride, such as but not limited to through a smartphone, tablet and/or kiosk.  Such selections may be prompted of a player when they are in line waiting to play or otherwise
proximate to the game.  Such may be implemented by various methods, including but not limited to placing QR codes that link to a selection screen associated with a specific ride/game on posts holding up a shade pavilion for those in line, using GPS
positioning to determine when a player is proximate to a particular game and popping up a selection screen.  Selections that are user selected may be selected through the selection screen/interface.  Selections that are automatically selected by the
system (group default selections, age restrictions, ride facilitator settings, etc.) may be automatically selected before presenting selection options to the player in order to better inform the player of what may be selected.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, a computerized game system that is operating according to one or more embodiments described herein may be able to provide a highly customized and disparate game experience to a group of players while still providing a coordinated
and/or synchronized game experience to the same.  One or more modules, named herein as a module or not, may be used in such a computerized game system to provide one or more of the benefits, features, options, possibilities, functions, operations, and
the like described herein.  Such modules may be in sufficient communication with each other so as to provide the associated benefits, features, options, possibilities, functions, operations, and the like described herein as one of ordinary skill in the
art would recognize would be appropriate for the performance thereof.

associated a purchase with a user account and may credit the user account with an in-game item for the purchase of a real item or service.  As a non-limiting example, when a energy drink is purchased, a user account may be credited with a virtual healing
potion or medpack that may be used in a game/ride/event.  Virtual purchases may, vice-versa, entitle an account holder to real items.  Virtual rewards may also (non-limiting example: getting a free soda for achieving a high score).
<br/><br/> In one non-limiting embodiment, there may be a group of rides/events/games that provide a parallel-style interactive experience for a plurality of users, such that the theme, interfaces, game-play, experience for different users may be different
in style, theme, role, graphics, content and the like, but at least some game data is shared between players and/or experiences may be shared.  Such rides may permit players of varying skill levels, interests, maturity levels, legal status (child, adult,
etc.), and the like and combinations thereof to experience a collective game/ride/event while customizing the same to each.  As a non-limiting example, there may be a game wherein an adult player is experiencing driving a tank through a WWII themed
battlefield and watching soldiers being shot by the machine gunner of his tank while a child player is experiencing shooting stylized marshmallows at animated farm animals while riding on a characterization of a tractor driven by the adult player.  In
one non-limiting example, such may be accomplished by using a shared game engine module with diverse media file sets loaded as skins/mods/textures/music/sound effects/etc. for each interface/player.  Accordingly, the rules associated with each experience
are fundamentally identical, but the experiences are fundamentally different (ESRB Rating, theme, etc.).
<br/><br/> In one non-limiting embodiment, a park location module may track locations of park visitors (carried gps devices, signal triangulation of wireless devices carried by the individuals, facial recognition through in-park cameras, etc.) and may
associate such location data with particular footage capture times of media capture devices (video camera, microphone, infrared camera, etc.) that are known (on a table, list or otherwise tracked by computer/database).  A collector module may collect
media information from the media capture or an associated media storage module according to a dataset of a particular individual and/or group of individuals and may automatically generate a media file of the same.  Such may be generated in order of
creation or in another order (scripted, randomized, determined by human input, etc.) such that a media file associated with an individual park visitor and/or group may be generated automatically or partially automatically and the same may be delivered,
sold, displayed, published, syndicated, combined with other data/media or the like or combinations thereof as desired (and such delivery/etc. may be automated by a module).
<br/><br/> As one non-limiting example, a group of friends may attend a park and images, sound, video, etc. may be captured by such a system and automatically organized into a pre-scripted or pre-formated or templated media presentation (video, power
point, podcast, press release, etc.) that they then may select or purchase for later consumption and distribution.  The content may simultaneously be offered to the visitors in a plurality of formats/scripts/etc. such as but not limited to styles
including Reality Show, Documentary, News Article, Vacation Footage, Humorous Adaptation, Parody, and the like and combinations thereof.  Particular game events may trigger table entries in the storage of location and media collection data tables for a
particular user such that the recordation of such events may be automatically identified.  As a non-limiting example, a game local may include a camera directed at each player and when that player experiences a meaningful event (win, lose, finish quest,
kill opponent, be killed, get a high score, etc.) then a record may be made in a table wherein the media recording device, the time, the user, and a characterization of the event may be automatically recorded for use later by a collection module.
<br/><br/> As described herein, a module or computerized device may include one or more of the following that may be in communication one with the other, either directly or indirectly: processor, bus, RAM, ROM, power supply, state device, hard drive,
floppy drive, display, display adaptor, video card, audio card, network card, i/o device, keyboard, mouse, controller, joystick, and the like.

and between game-play.  Particular attention is paid to communication between game play.
<br/><br/> The data sequence diagram includes Player A, Player B, the Employee and the third party entertainment service sending game interaction data to the system.  Described parties interact through computerized devices sending data over a network. 
Data may be processed by a recipient, using a processor and/or mentally, and appropriate responses/reactions/data changes/configuration adjustments may be may thereafter.  The game interaction data may include but not limited to any interaction between
the plurality of remote interfaces or the users with the theme/amusement park, games/rides, social network chats, etc. The system sends back to Player A, Player B, the Employee, and the third party entertainment service game results data.  Game results
data may be, but not limited to: scores, records, accomplishments, achievements, awards, honors, missions updates, etc.
<br/><br/> Player A, Player B, the Employee, and the third party entertainment service sends feedback data to the system regarding the recent game interaction.  Feedback may be, but not limited to: a chat room, a message board, a discussion board, private
messages, public posts, personal messages, etc. configured to allow users to post questions, answers, scores, records, or conversations with other users.  The feedback may include a player rating module configured to allow users to rate other players or
users participating in a previous game or ride.  The users may be able to rate other players on skill level, experience level, level expertise, ability, status, good deeds, and etc.
<br/><br/> The system sends to Player A, Player B. the Employee, and the third part entertainment service the feedback results relating to the recent game interaction.  The accounts of Player A, Player B, the Employee, and the third party entertainment
service are updated with the system, including but not limited to making alterations in a table in a user account, such as but not limited to incrementing or decrementing a reputation field.  The data sequence illustrates a trade transaction between
Player A and Player B. The trade transaction may include, but not limited to the trading of: points, awards, achievements, weapons, monetary funds, equipment, store tokens, etc. Then Player A, Player B, the Employee, and the third party entertainment
service send game interaction data to the system and the sequence may be repeated.
<br/><br/> There may be an exemplary ride control module in communication with a command module, a tank module, a helicopter module, and a infantry module.

<br/><br/> End: Prophetic Contextual Method and/or System Description
<br/><br/> It is understood that the above-described embodiments are only illustrative of the application of the principles of the present invention.  The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or
essential characteristics.  The described embodiment is to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive.  The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description.  All
changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.
<br/><br/> For example, although particular devices and configurations are described, it is understood that implementation may be made in many manners and through many devices including devices and configurations not yet in existence which may be later
invented.
<br/><br/> Additionally, although the figures illustrate particular connections and particular sets of modules, it is understood that any of the modules described herein may be connected, directly or indirectly to any of the other modules described herein
and that the modes and manners of connections are plethoric.
<br/><br/> It is also envisioned that visitors may cross the line between visitor and employee to varying degrees.  As a non-limiting example, a player having a notable skill, talent, proclivity, reputation, or the like or combinations thereof may be
identified and singled out to participate in a game/ride/event as a volunteer or employee in a manner that facilitates the enjoyment of other visitors.  As a non-limiting example, a visitor who has the highest score on a particular game may be selected
to be a "Boss" of a particular combat event and may therefore participate in one respect or another as an employee-type user.  Employees may be able to earn digital/real-world rewards and/or influence their user accounts in the same or similar ways that
visitors do.
<br/><br/> It is expected that there could be numerous variations of the design of this invention.  An example is that the method and system may be embodied in any genre, game style (puzzles, combat, action, strategy, rpg, etc.), characters, brand, theme,
size of park, style of park (water parks, roller coaster parks, wilderness survival parks, island resort parks, water sport parks, performance stages, interactive haunted houses, training facilities (corporate, military, retreat, hunting, competitive
sport, non-competitive sport, etc.), shopping malls, festivals, fairs, courses (paintball, lasertag, etc.), entertainment centers, entertainment tours, and the like and combinations thereof.
<br/><br/> Finally, it is envisioned that components or portions of the system may be constructed of a variety of materials, including but not limited to plastics, metals, composites, ceramics, fibers, electrons, light beams, magnetic fields, and the like
and combinations thereof.
<br/><br/> Thus, while the present invention has been fully described above with particularity and detail in connection with what is presently deemed to be the most practical and preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be apparent to those of
ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications, including, but not limited to, variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use may be made, without departing from the principles and concepts of the
invention as set forth in the claims.  Further, it is contemplated that an embodiment may be limited to consist of or to consist essentially of one or more of the features, functions, structures, methods described herein.
