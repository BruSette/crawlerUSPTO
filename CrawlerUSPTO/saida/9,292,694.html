       <p> Described systems and methods allow a mobile device, such as a smartphone
     or a tablet computer, to protect a user of the respective device from
     fraud and/or loss of privacy. In some embodiments, the mobile device
     receives from a server a risk indicator indicative of whether executing a
     target application causes a privacy risk. Determining the risk indicator
     includes automatically supplying a test input to a data field used by the
     target application, the data field configured to hold a private item such
     as a password or a geolocation indicator. Determining the risk indicator
     further comprises determining whether a test device executing an instance
     of the target application transmits an indicator of the test input, such
     as the test input itself or a hash of the test input, to another party on
     the network.

<br/><br/> The invention relates to systems and methods for protecting computer and mobile communication systems from malware, and in particular to protecting users of such devices from privacy-invading and/or fraudulent use of personal data.
<br/><br/> Modern mobile computing and telecommunication devices, such as smartphones, tablet computers, and wearable computing devices, are capable of executing a variety of application programs, commonly known as apps.  Such applications are developed by
thousands of developers worldwide, and may be downloaded from specialized online aggregators such as Apple, Inc.'s App Store.RTM., or Google's Google Play.RTM..  Applications may use components, features, and functionalities of the respective mobile
device, such as a camera or a geolocation feature of the device.  For instance, an application may determine a current geographical position of the device and display to a user a list of restaurants located in the vicinity of the current position.
<br/><br/> Some applications may access personal information of the users, such as a user's name, street address, telephone number, email address, or contact list, among others.  Other examples of data accessed by apps include identification data and a
network address of the respective mobile device.  Some applications may further modify, record, and/or transmit such information to other parties over local or wide-area networks, including the Internet.  In some cases, such operations are performed
without knowledge or permission of the respective user, thus exposing the user to a risk of privacy invasion and, in worst cases, fraud.  Often, users are unaware of such risks.

processor 20 to devices 24-38, among others.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2-B shows an exemplary hardware configuration of security server 16 according to some embodiments of the present invention.  Security server 16 includes a processor 120 and a memory unit 122, and may further comprise a set of storage
devices 128 and at least one communication interface controller 130, all connected by a set of buses 139.  In some embodiments, the operation of processor 120, memory 122, and storage devices 128 may be similar to the operation of items 20, 22, and 28,
respectively, as described above in relation to FIG. 2-A. Memory unit 122 stores data/signals accessed or generated by processor 120 in the course of carrying out instructions.  Controller(s) 130 enable(s) security server 16 to connect to network 18, to
transmit and/or receive data to/from other systems connected to network 18.  Exemplary controller(s) 130 include network adapters, among others.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary software stack executing on client system 12 according to some embodiments of the present invention.  In some embodiments, system 12 executes an operating system (OS) 40 and/or a set of software applications
42a-c. OS 40 comprises software that provides an interface to the hardware of client system 12, and acts as a host for computing applications 42a-c running on the respective OS.  OS 40 may comprise any widely available operating system such as iOS.RTM.,

(e.g., media player, gaming), social media (e.g., Facebook.RTM.), mapping/navigation, online banking, and online shopping applications, among others.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a security application 44 executes on OS 40, security application 44 configured to receive from security server 16 an indicator of a behavior of software applications 42a-c, as detailed below.  In particular, the respective
behavior may be indicative of a privacy risk to which a user of client system 12 is exposed by installing the respective applications, and/or by executing the respective applications.  Security application 44 may be further configured to display
information about such risks and/or risk-indicative behaviors to a user of client system 12.  For instance, application 44 may assemble a list of all applications 42a-c installed on client system 12, and for each such application, display a list of
risk-indicative behaviors associated to the respective application.  The operation of security application 44 will be discussed in more detail below.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4-A shows an exemplary risk assessment transaction between client system 12 and security server 16.  In some embodiments, client system 12, for instance via security application 44, may send an application indicator 46 to security server
16.  In response to receiving indicator 46, security server 16 may identify a target application according to indicator 46, and may selectively retrieve a risk indicator 50 indicative of a behavior performed by the respective target application from a
behavior database 52.  Security server 16 may further transmit risk indicator 50 to client system 12, thus concluding the risk-assessment transaction.
<br/><br/> Parts of database 52 may reside on security server 16, on a separate physical machine, and/or on computer-readable media connected to security server 16 by way of e.g., network 18.  In some embodiments, behavior database 52 comprises a set of
behavior entries, and a set of application entries, wherein each behavior entry is indicative of an application behavior, such as accessing a user's address book, and wherein each application entry is indicative of an application.  In some embodiments,
behavior database 52 may further comprise an indicator, such as a hash index, indicative of an association between a behavior and an application performing the respective behavior.  Such an association indicator may enable security server 16 and/or
client systems 12a-b to selectively retrieve a behavior entry according to application indicator 46.  In some embodiments, an application may be associated with a plurality of behaviors, and/or a behavior may be associated with a plurality of
applications.
<br/><br/> Some behavior entries may represent risk-indicative behaviors, i.e., behaviors associated with a privacy risk; for each such entry, database 52 may store a flag indicating that the respective behavior poses a risk.  Each behavior entry of a
risk-indicative behavior may comprise a description of the respective behavior, indicating, for instance, why the respective behavior is risky, and/or giving an exemplary scenario exemplifying the risk to the user.  The respective behavior entry may
further comprise an indicator of a type of risk (e.g., fraud) and/or level of risk (e.g., low, medium, and high).  In some embodiments, a behavior entry may further comprise an indicator of an operating system and/or of an operating system version,
wherein the respective behavior is observed.  For instance, there may exist behaviors, which can only be performed, or have only been observed, on Android.RTM.  platforms.  In some embodiment, behavior entries are pre-determined and input into database
52 e.g. by human operators.
<br/><br/> Each application entry of database 52 may include an indicator of a name and version of the respective application.  In some embodiments, each application entry may further comprise elements of application indicator 46 (e.g, hashes, see below)
determined for the respective application, and allowing a positive identification of the respective application.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, security server 16 is configured to populate database 52 by identifying a set of risk-indicative behaviors associated with a set of applications distributed by application server 14.  Identifying such risk-indicative
behaviors may comprise determining whether each application performs a selected behavior identified by a behavior entry stored in database 52.  When the respective application performs the selected behavior, the operation of security server 16 further
comprises updating database 52 to include an application entry of the respective application, and/or updating database 52 to indicate an association between the behavior entry of the respective behavior and the application entry of the respective
application.  FIG. 4-B shows an exemplary transaction between security server 16 and application server 14, the transaction performed to identify risk-indicative behaviors of a target application 42.  In some embodiments, security server 16 transmits an
application request 58 to application server 14, request 58 comprising a request to retrieve a copy of target application 42 from server 14.  In response, application server 14 may send the copy of target application 42 to security server 16.  Server 16
may the determine risk indicator 50 indicating a behavior of target application 42, and transmit indicator 50 to database 52.  The operation of security server 16 is further detailed below.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 shows an exemplary application indicator 46 determined for target application 42, such as applications 42a-c in FIG. 3.  In some embodiments, indicator 46 comprises data enabling security server 16 to selectively identify target
application 42 from a plurality of applications.  Such identification may comprise determining a name and a version (e.g., release number, build number, update timestamp) of the target application, and may further comprise determining a name and version
of the operating system executing on the client system hosting the respective application.  An exemplary identification may be: target application is Path.RTM.  from Path, Inc., version 2.9.4, executing on Android.RTM.  4.0.  In some embodiments,
indicator 46 may not allow security server 16 to unequivocally identify the target application, as there may be a plurality of target applications indicated to by the respective instance of indicator 46.  In one such example, several distinct
applications may employ the same application programming interface (API) during execution.  Attempting to identify a target application according to whether it uses the respective API, may therefore produce multiple matching applications.  In an
additional example, two processes, each launched by a distinct application, may have the same name.  Identifying the respective applications according to the process name may therefore fail to produce unequivocal identification.  Some embodiments of
indicator 46 may enable the determination of the application name, but not of the application version or operating system.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, application indicator 46 includes a set of values (e.g., alphanumeric) determined according to target application 42.  Such values may include a set of hashes, illustrated as items 48a-c in FIG. 5.  An exemplary indicator 46
includes a hash of a name of a package file of the respective application, for instance a hash of the name of the respective APP file on iOS.RTM.  platforms, or a hash of the name of the respective APK file on client systems running Android.RTM.. 
Another exemplary indicator includes a hash of an image file used as a screen icon by the respective target application.  In some embodiments, indicator 46 comprises an indicator (e.g., hash of a name) of a process launched by target application 42. 
Indicator 46 may further include an indicator of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme used by target application 42.  Examples of such URI schemes include http<b><i>:, facebook</i></b>:, facetime:, mailto:, skype:, and market:, among others.  Other exemplary
indicators 46 include platform-dependent application identifiers such as indicators of a path or of a location/address where data of the respective application is stored.  Indicator 46 may further include an identifier of the hardware of client system
12, such as an International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, illustrated as item 48d in FIG. 5, or a Unique Device Identifier (UDID), among others.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 shows an exemplary risk indicator 50 received by client system 12 from security server 16 in response to sending application indicator 46.  Risk indicator 50 comprises a set of values, for instance alphanumeric, each value indicative of a
behavior of target application 42.  An exemplary risk indicator includes a behavior label (pointer), illustrated as item 54a, and/or a behavior hash index, illustrated as item 54b.  Such pointers/hash indices establish a correspondence between target
application 42 and a selected set of behavior entries 56a-c stored in behavior database 52, hence indicating a set of behaviors associated with target application 42.  For instance, in the example of FIG. 6, item 54a points to a behavior entry 56b,
whereas item 54b points to a behavior entry 56c.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7-A shows exemplary components executing on security server 16 according to some embodiments of the present invention.  Server 16 may include a communication manager 62 and an application analyzer 60 connected to communication manager 62. 
Application analyzer 62 may further comprise a behavior manager 66 and a traffic sniffer 68, both connected to a device emulator 64.  In some embodiments, communication manager 62 is configured to perform transactions with client systems 12a-b and/or
application server 14, as illustrated in FIGS. 4-A-B. Such transactions may include establishing connections over network 18, receiving application indicator 46, retrieving risk indicator 50 from database 52, and transmitting risk indicator 50 to the
respective client system.  Also, manager 62 may establish connections with application server 14, transmit application request 58, and receive target application 42 from server 14.  Device emulator 64 may perform an emulation of a client system, such as
a smartphone or a tablet computer, to create a virtual test device 112.  In some embodiments, behavior manager 66 is configured to execute an instance of target application 42 on the virtual device, and to install an input agent 69 on the virtual device,
input agent 69 configured to trigger a behavior of target application 42 as shown below.  In some embodiments, network sniffer 68 may determine whether the target application performs a behavior deemed to pose a privacy risk to a user, as further shown
below.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7-B shows an alternative configuration to FIG. 7-A. In FIG. 7-B, a physical test device 212 is used in conjunction with security server 16.  Examples of test devices 212 include a smartphone and a tablet computer, among others.  Test device
112 may be similar in functionality to client systems 12a-b of FIG. 1.  In the configuration of FIG. 7-B, security server 16 may comprise an application analyzer 160 connected to a communication manager 62.  Application analyzer 160 may further include a
behavior manager 166 and a traffic sniffer 168.  Test device 212 executes an instance of OS 40, such as iOS.RTM.  or Android.RTM., among others, and further executes an input agent 169 on OS 40.  In some embodiments, application analyzer 160 is connected
to a communication device 230, such as a wireless modem, and uses device 230 for two-way communication with test device 212, including with input agent 169.  In some embodiments, the operation of items 60, 62, 66, 68 and 69 may be similar to the
operation of items 160, 162, 166, 168 and 169, respectively.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary sequence of steps carried out by application analyzer 60 (FIG. 7-A), to identify risk-indicative behaviors of target application 42, according to some embodiments of the present invention.  In a step 202,
application analyzer 60 employs device emulator 64 to emulate a client system.  In some embodiments, emulating the client system includes creating virtual device 112, comprising a software-generated environment that closely mimics and behaves like the
actual hardware of the respective client system, and executing an instance of an operating system on virtual test device 112.  Application analyzer 60 may execute the sequence illustrated in FIG. 8 repeatedly for a variety of devices (e.g., smartphones,
tablets, personal computers) and/or a variety of OSs (e.g., Android.RTM., Windows.RTM.).
<br/><br/> In a step 204, application analyzer 60 may invoke behavior manager 66 to trigger a behavior of target application 42.  To trigger said behavior, manager 66 may employ input agent 69 executing on virtual test device 112.  FIG. 9 illustrates an
exemplary sequence of steps performed by behavior manager 66 in step 204 according to some embodiments of the present invention.  In a step 212, manager 66 may detect a device identification indicator of the virtual device.  Exemplary such indicators
include an IMEI, an UDID, a serial number, and a make and/or model of the virtual device, among others.  In a step 214, manager 66 may determine hardware and/or OS specifications of device 112, such as a type and version of the OS executing on virtual
device 112.  Next, in a step 216, manager 66 may personalize virtual test device 112, such personalization comprising, for example, configuring device 112 with personal information such as a name, a telephone number, a photograph, and an email address of
a virtual user.  Personalizing virtual test device 112 may further comprise filling an address book or contact list of device 112 with a set of virtual profiles, each such profile comprising for instance a name, a telephone number, and an email address. 
Data, such as names and addresses, used in personalizing device 112 may be predetermined and/or generated in a reproducible manner, so as to allow traffic sniffer 68 to determine whether an instance of the respective data is transmitted by application 42
to other parties over the network.  In some embodiments, personalizing device 112 further comprises creating a set of functional resources, such as a working telephone number, email account, and/or a functional account for another service such as
teleconferencing, instant messaging, and social networking, among others, and using configuration data of such functional resources (email address, telephone number, username, alias, etc.) to personalize device 112.  The respective resources may then be
monitored to further identify risk-indicative behaviors of application 42, for instance to detect whether application 42 is using a user's personal data to send unsolicited communication (spam).
<br/><br/> A step 218 may select a target application for analysis.  In some embodiments, application analyzer may process a plurality of target applications in batch mode; in such cases, a sequence of steps 220-228 may be executed in a loop, for each
target application in turn.  In step 220, manager 66 may receive target application 42, for instance by retrieving a copy of application 42 from application server 14 via communication manager 62 (see FIG. 4-B).  Step 220 further comprises installing
target application 42 on virtual test device 112.  Next, in a step 222, behavior manager 66 may launch application 42 into execution.
<br/><br/> In a step 224, behavior manager 66 may call on input agent 69 to perform an automatic input action, comprising generating a test input and supplying said test input to a data field used by target application 42.  In some embodiments, step 224
may comprise launching input agent 69, and configuring agent 69 to execute for a predetermined time period.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, data fields targeted by input manager 69 comprise private data fields, configured to hold indicators of private items, the disclosure of which may create a privacy risk.  Exemplary private items include a username, a
password, an address book entry, and a geographical location, among others.  To gain access to data fields used by application 42, input agent 69 may employ any method known in the art, for instance a method used in automatic software testing.
<br/><br/> Supplying the test input may include filling in an input field, such as a form field, exposed by target application 42.  In an exemplary embodiment, agent 69 may intercept (e.g., hook) an application launch service of the operating system, such
as the Springboard process of iOS.RTM..  Exemplary software performing such interception include the open-source Cycript package for iOS.RTM.  (retrievable from www.cycript.org), and Robotium for Android.RTM., from Jayway Ltd.  In an iOS.RTM. 
embodiment, intercepting the Springboard process may give input agent 69 access to a set of user interfaces exposed by target application 42.  Agent 69 may then parse each user interface view and determine whether the respective view contains any input
fields.  FIG. 10 illustrates an exemplary user interface 70 exposed by an application, the interface including a plurality of input fields 72a-d, such as a plain text field 72a, a hidden/password text field 72b, a button 72c, and a slider 72d.
<br/><br/> For each input field, input agent 69 may determine whether the respective input field may trigger a behavior of the target application.  In such determinations, agent 69 may use a set of predetermined rules; for instance, submit buttons,
sliders, and text fields may be selected as possibly triggering a behavior of the target application.  When an input field is selected, agent 69 may proceed to supply a test input to the respective field, for instance by filling in text fields, clicking
on buttons, etc. For each text input field, such as a password field or an address book field, agent 69 may supply a test string comprising a sequence of characters to the respective field.  Exemplary test strings are illustrated by items 74a-b in FIG.
10.  In some embodiments, test strings are predetermined or generated by an automated generator in a reproducible manner (e.g., according to a predetermined set of keywords).  For each filled-in text field, input agent 69 may register the respective test
string for future reference, together with an indicator of an association between the respective input field and the respective test string.  Registering test strings may allow application analyzer 60 to determine, for instance, whether an indicator of
the respective test string is transmitted by target application 42 to another party on the network, as shown in more detail below.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the actions performed by input agent 69 in step 224 (FIG. 9) may be performed repeatedly, for a plurality of views and/or input fields exposed by target application 42.  Testing multiple combinations of inputs in this manner
may increase the likelihood of determining target application 42 to trigger certain risk-indicative behaviors.  In one such example, comprising a target application 42 that requires users to register before using the application, input agent 69 may
attempt to determine application 42 to expose a registration view (for instance, by clicking various combinations of interface buttons).  Such registration views commonly include username/password fields, allowing agent 69 to test a behavior of
application 42 in handling such fields.  When registration requires other actions on the part of the user, such as email activation comprising having the user click a link received in an email message to activate application 42, application analyzer 60
may be configured to carry out such registration procedures automatically (e.g., provide an email address, respond to an registration message, etc.).  In some embodiments, application 42 may use for registration an email address taken from a user profile
or an address book entry of virtual test device 112; in such cases application analyzer 60 may check an email account set up according to the user profile or address book entry to respond to the registration message.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, supplying the test input comprises determining whether target application 42 uses a data field configured to hold data provided by another application.  In one such example, application 42 may access the test device's
address book, to read data such as a name or telephone number of a person listed as a contact.  In another example, application 42 may request a geolocation indicator from a sensor device (e.g., a GPS sensor) of the virtual device.  In some embodiments,
input agent 69 may intercept such a request, for instance by detecting an API call to perform the respective action (e.g., get the current GPS position, get a digital image from the camera, activate a Bluetooth.RTM.  device, etc.).  Input agent 69 may
further generate the test input to match a data type and/or format of a data object (e.g., GPS location indicator) returned when executing the respective API call, and supply the test input, instead of the respective data object, to the requesting
function call.
<br/><br/> When input agent 69 exits, in a sequence of steps 226-228 (FIG. 9), behavior manager 66 may stop application 42 and then uninstall application 42 from virtual test device 112.  Next, a step 230 may determine whether a termination criterion for
emulation is satisfied.  An exemplary termination criterion comprises determining whether the last application of a batch of target applications has been analyzed.  When the termination criterion is satisfied, manager 66 may signal device emulator 64 to
stop emulation in a step 232.  When the termination criterion is not satisfied, execution returns to step 218, for instance to select another target application for analysis.  In the example of FIG. 9, only one application may be installed and executed
at one time (the sequence of steps 220-228 is completed for each application in turn).  Such a configuration may be preferable over executing a plurality of applications concurrently, since it allows any behavior detected by application analyzer 60 to be
attributed unequivocally to the target application currently executing.
<br/><br/> Going back to FIG. 8, in a step 206, application analyzer 60 employs traffic sniffer 68 to analyze any communication generated between virtual test device 112 and a network (such as network 18 in FIG. 1), during execution of target application
42, to determine whether application 42 performs a risk-indicative behavior.  For instance, traffic sniffer 68 may try to detect whether instances of a test string (e.g., a test password, some contact data), supplied by behavior manager 66 to target
application 42, are being transmitted to other parties over the network.  Such behavior may indicate a privacy risk associated to application 42.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, traffic sniffer 68 is connected to device emulator 64, and is configured to analyze an output of a virtual communication device set up by emulator 64.  Such virtual communication devices may emulate physical communication
devices, for instance a wireless modem or an Ethernet port, of a client system (see e.g., item 30 in FIG. 2-A).  In some embodiments, analyzing an output of a virtual communication device comprises parsing a network log collected during execution of
target application 42 (step 204 in FIG. 8).  The respective network log may include a record of all incoming and/or outgoing communication between the virtual device executing application 42 and other entities on the network.
<br/><br/> To detect instances of a test string being transmitted over the virtual communication device, traffic sniffer 68 may employ any method known in the art, for instance pattern matching algorithms applied to a network log.  In some embodiments,
traffic sniffer 68 attempts to match not only the test string, but also a set of hashes of the respective test string, determined using various hash functions such as message digest (e.g., MD5) and secure hash (SHA) algorithms.  In so doing, traffic
sniffer 68 may detect whether a test string, such as a password, is being sent in plain text form or in encrypted form, and may also estimate a strength of the encryption algorithm employed to encrypt the respective test string.  In one such example,
wherein application 42 transmits data via a HTTP request, wherein test string "john47" was supplied to an input field called "usr" and test string "password47" was supplied to an input field called "pass", and assuming a hash of "password47" is
"bf53a56d", the respective HTTP request may include exemplary strings "usr=john47&amp;pass=password47", or "usr=john47&amp;pass=bf53a56d".  Traffic sniffer 68 may try to match the strings "john47", "password47", and "bf53a56d", among others, within the
respective HTTP request.
<br/><br/> When performing pattern matching of hashes, as described above, test strings may be hashed individually, or in combination with other test strings.  For instance, to determine whether contents of an address book are being transmitted to another
party, traffic sniffer 68 may hash a content of each field individually (e.g., each first name, each last name, each telephone number separately), a content of each profile individually (e.g., first name+last name+telephone number for each listed
person), and a content of the entire address book, among others.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, application 42 may use an encrypted communication channel, for instance a protocol such as transport layer security (TLS) or HTTPS, to communicate with other parties on the network.  In such situations, traffic sniffer 68
may employ any method known in the art, for instance a man-in-the-middle method, to decrypt the respective communication prior to performing string matching.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, in a step 208 (FIG. 8), application analyzer 60 may construct risk indicator 50 of application 42, and may transmit indicator 50 to behavior database 52.  Some embodiments of analyzer 60 may incorporate into indicator 50 a
set of device-identification and/or OS identification data, such as data determined in steps 212-214 (FIG. 9), thus associating a set of behaviors with a type of device and/or with a type of operating system.
<br/><br/> Although the above description related to FIGS. 8-9-10 applies to the exemplary configuration of security server 16 illustrated in FIG. 7-A, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that methods described above may be adapted with minimal
modification to apply to the alternative configuration shown in FIG. 7-B. Such modification may comprise, for instance, executing target application 42 on physical test device 212, instead of virtual test device 112.  Also, actions performed by
application analyzer 60 related to device emulation may no longer be needed.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11-A shows an exemplary sequence of steps performed by security application 44 executing on client system 12 (e.g., FIG. 3), according to some embodiments of the present invention.  In a step 242, application 44 detects a target application
42 installed on client system 12.  To detect that an application is installed, security application 44 may use static and/or dynamic methods.  In some embodiments, static methods comprise methods of identifying an application without actually executing
the respective application.  Several static methods are known in the art.  For instance, application 44 may identify target application 42 according to a name of a package file, according to a location of a resource (such as a file) of the respective
application, and/or according to an image used as a screen icon by the respective application.  In another exemplary static method, security application 44 may identify target application 42 according to a set of URI schemes used by application 42.  In
some embodiments, a combination of static methods may be used, for instance by combining a set of identification scores, each score determined according to a distinct static method.  Alternatively, security application 44 may employ a decision tree,
progressively pruning a set of candidate applications by successive use of static methods.  In some embodiments, dynamic methods include identifying target application 42 according to a behavior or an output of the respective application.  Another
exemplary dynamic method comprises determining a set of processes launched by the respective application, and matching a list of applications against a list of processes to identify candidate applications.
<br/><br/> In a step 244, security application 44 computes application indicator 46 of target application 42 and transmits indicator 46 to security server 16.  In a step 246, security application 44 may receive risk indicator 50 from security server 16. 
Exemplary indicators 46 and 50 were described above, in relation to FIGS. 4-A, 5, and 6.  Next, in a step 248, security application 44 may display to the user an indicator of a behavior and/or an indicator of a risk associated with installation and/or
execution of target application 42.  To execute step 248, security application 44 may maintain a local repository of behavior entries and selectively retrieve a set of behaviors indicated by risk indicator 50 from the local repository.  Such a local
repository may be kept up to date by periodic or on-demand software updates from security server 16 or from behavior database 52.  Alternatively, security application 44 may selectively retrieve the set of behavior entries remotely from database 52.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11-B illustrates an exemplary sequence of steps performed by an alternative embodiment of security application 44.  In contrast to FIG. 11-A, in a step 252, instead of automatically detecting installed applications, security application 44
may select target application 42 according to an input from a user.  FIG. 11-B may represent for instance a scenario, in which the user may be interested in evaluating target application 42 before deciding whether to download and/or install the
respective application.  In an exemplary embodiment, security application 44 may execute as a server-side script, and may be accessed by client system 12 via a webpage allowing the user to select an application by e.g., clicking an icon.  In an
alternative embodiment, application 44 may function as a client-side script or a plugin for a web browser.  Security application 44 may maintain a list of candidate applications evaluated for risk-indicative behavior, and may display the respective list
to the user.  Application 44 may further receive user input indicative of a choice of target application.  In a step 254, application 44 may formulate application indicator 46 and send indicator 46 to security server 16.  To perform step 254, some
embodiments may maintain a set of predetermined application indicators, each predetermined for an application of the list of candidate applications, and may selectively retrieve indicator 46 according to the user's selection.  Steps 256-258 may proceed
in a manner similar to that of steps 246-248, respectively.
<br/><br/> The exemplary systems and methods described above allow a client device, such as a smartphone or a tablet computer, to protect the privacy of a user of the respective device, including to protect the user from online fraud.  In some embodiments,
the client device sends an indicator of a target application to a security server.  For example, the target application may be installed on the client system.  In response, the client device receives from the security server a risk indicator indicative
of whether installing and/or executing the target application causes a security risk.  In some embodiments, the risk indicator comprises an indicator of a behavior of the target application, the behavior itself indicative of the respective security risk. Exemplary risk-indicative behaviors of the target application include sending personal data, such as address book entries and passwords, over the network.  The client device may display a list and/or a description of such risk-indicative behaviors to the
user.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, determining the risk indicator occurs at the security server and includes installing and executing an instance of the target application on a test device (physical or emulated), automatically detecting an input field exposed
by the target application, for instance an address book field or a password field exposed within a user interface, and supplying a test string to the respective input field.  Next, the security server determines whether the test device transmits an
indicator of the test string, such as the test string itself or a hash of the test string, to another party on the network.  When such transmissions are detected, security server may determine that executing the target application may cause the security
risk.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, determining the risk indicator comprises supplying a test input to the target application, the test input being of other kind than a user input.  For instance, the target application may request input from another
application (e.g., requesting a geolocation indicator from a GPS sensor), or may access various device and/or OS configuration data (e.g., a device identification indicator, or an address book entry).  In such cases, supplying the test input may comprise
intercepting a function call of the target application, and supplying the test input to mimic a result of executing the respective function call.  The security server may then determine whether an indicator of the test input is transmitted over the
network.
<br/><br/> It will be clear to one skilled in the art that the above embodiments may be altered in many ways without departing from the scope of the invention.  Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined by the following claims and their
legal equivalents.
