<br/><br/> N/A
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to telecommunication techniques and integrated circuit (IC) devices.  More specifically, embodiments of the present invention provide a silicon photonics device having improved wavelength sensitivity to device
dimensions and a communication interface using the silicon photonics device.
<br/><br/> Over the last few decades, the use of communication networks has exploded.  In the early days of the Internet, popular applications were limited to emails, bulletin board, and mostly informational and text-based web page surfing, and the amount
of data transferred was relatively small.  Today, Internet and mobile applications demand a huge amount of bandwidth for transferring photo, video, music, and other multimedia files.  For example, a social network like <b><i>Facebook</i></b> processes more than 500 TB
of data daily.  With such high demands on data and data transfer, existing data communication systems need to be improved to address these needs.
<br/><br/> CMOS technology is commonly used to design communication systems implementing Optical Fiber Links.  As CMOS technology is scaled down to make circuits and systems run at higher speed and occupy smaller chip (die) area, the operating supply
voltage is reduced for lower power consumption.  Conventional FET transistors in deep-submicron CMOS processes have very low breakdown voltage as a result the operating supply voltage is maintained around 1 Volt.  The Photo-detectors (PD) used in 28G and
10G Optical Receivers require a bias voltage of more than 2 Volts across the anode and cathode nodes of the PD for better photo-current responsivity.  These limitations provide significant challenges to the continued improvement of communication systems
scaling and performance.
<br/><br/> There have been many types of communication systems and methods.  Unfortunately, they have been inadequate for various applications.  Therefore, improved communication systems and methods are desired.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to telecommunication techniques and integrated circuit (IC) devices.  More specifically, embodiments of the present invention provide a silicon photonics device having improved wavelength sensitivity to device
dimensions and a communication interface using the silicon photonics device.  In certain embodiments, the silicon photonics device can be implemented as an optical (de)multiplexer, a polarization diversity receiver, or the like.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the present invention provides a silicon photonics device and system therefor.  The silicon photonics device can include a 300 nm SOI (silicon-on-insulator with 300 nm top Si) overlying a substrate member.  A waveguide
structure can be configured from a portion of the SOI layer and disposed overlying the substrate member.  This waveguide structure can include a 300 nm.times.300 nm symmetric AWG (Arrayed Waveguide Gratings) structure or an Echelle grating structure
characterized by a top silicon thickness of 300 nm.  The waveguide structure can also include a polarization compensator material configured to provide at least two material index ratings in the waveguide structure.  The silicon photonics device can be
configured within a monolithically integrated system on a chip device to provide fiber optic telecommunication functions.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the present invention provides various silicon photonics device configurations of polarization diversity receivers.  The silicon photonics device can include a PBS (Polarization Beam Splitter) overlying a substrate member.  The
PBS can have a TE+TM (Transverse Electric+Transverse Magnetic) input and a TE output and a TM output.  A TE optimized demux (demultiplexer) can be configured overlying the substrate member, and can have a TE demux input coupled to the TE output, the TE
optimized demux having a plurality of TE demux outputs.  Also, a TM optimized demux can be configured overlying the substrate member.  The TM optimized demux can have a TM demux input coupled to the TM output, the TM optimized demux having a plurality of
TM demux outputs.  Furthermore, a plurality of PD (photodiode) structures can be provided overlying the substrate.  Each of these PD structures can be coupled to one of the plurality of TE demux outputs by a TE-PD path and one of the plurality of TM

<br/><br/> Many benefits are recognized through various embodiments of the present invention.  Such benefits include reduced sensitivity to thickness changes in crystalline silicon thickness and and/or waveguide width.  Silicon photonics devices using the
300 nm SOI wafer can be characterized by polarization independence and can be substantially free of polarization dependent wavelength shifts.  Using symmetric waveguide geometry, light signals can be transmitted being substantially free from time delays
between TE and TM light.  Other benefits will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that the mechanisms described can be applied to other communications systems as well.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to telecommunication techniques and integrated circuit (IC) devices.  More specifically, various embodiments of the present invention provide integrated silicon photonics devices.
<br/><br/> The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and to incorporate it in the context of particular applications.  Various modifications, as well as a variety of uses in different

<br/><br/> In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the present invention.  However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be

<br/><br/> Please note, if used, the labels left, right, front, back, top, bottom, forward, reverse, clockwise and counter clockwise have been used for convenience purposes only and are not intended to imply any particular fixed direction.  Instead, they

<br/><br/> Silicon photonics devices use silicon as an optical medium for fiber optic telecommunication systems.  Research and development of these silicon photonics devices allows for the combination of optical and electronic components integrated onto a
single chip.  The silicon is typically formed overlying an insulating material, otherwise known as SOI (silicon on insulator).  However, standard SOI wafers exhibit some significant problems.  Standard SOI wafers used for silicon photonics devices
typically are 220 nm SOI wafers (silicon-on-insulator substrate with 220 nm top Si layer).
<br/><br/> Standard waveguide designs (220 nm.times.450 nm for 1300 nm wavelength window, 220 nm.times.500 nm for 1550 nm wavelength window) exhibit very large polarization dependence.  Using this standard design as reference (220 nm.times.450 nm/500 nm
waveguide), the effective index N.sub.eff is 2.7 for a TE (Transverse Electric) mode and 2.3 for a TM (Transverse Magnetic) mode.  This causes a very large PDWS (polarization dependent wavelength shift) when used for an AWG (Arrayed Waveguide Gratings),
which are commonly used as optical (de)multiplexers.  Also, the group index N.sub.g is 4.1 for TE and 4.6 for TM for the same waveguide.  For a 1 mm long waveguide there is a 1.7 ps delay between TE and TM light (TM is slower).
<br/><br/> FIGS. 1A and 1B are simplified diagrams illustrating a conventional waveguide using a standard SOI (silicon-on-insulator) substrate and a symmetric waveguide using a SOI substrate according to an embodiment of the present invention,
respectively.  As shown, FIG. 1A depicts a standard waveguide 101 with the dimensions 220 nm.times.450 nm.  According to an embodiment, an object of the present invention addresses problems of standard SOI wafers for silicon photonics devices by
utilizing a 300 nm SOI wafer to establish polarization independence.  Particularly, a 300 nm.times.300 nm waveguide eliminates polarization dependence by use of symmetric geometry.  This waveguide 102 is shown in FIG. 1B.  For this waveguide embodiment
(300 nm.times.300 nm), N.sub.eff is 2.6 for both TE and TM and N.sub.g is 4.4 for both TE and TM.  Using this configuration, the PDWS issue is substantially eliminated and there is no time delay between the TE and TM light.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a table describing multiple configurations of silicon photonics devices according to various embodiments of the present invention.  As shown, the first configuration is an AWG with a 300 nm SOI wafer.  The two specifications shown
include crystalline Si (Silicon) thickness and waveguide width, and the related parameter for comparison is sensitivity to dimensions.  With the first configuration, the light transmission exhibits a 1 nm .lamda.c (center wavelength of AWG) shift for a 1
nm thickness change in Si thickness and exhibits a 1 nm .lamda.c shift for a 1 nm width change in waveguide width.
<br/><br/> The second configuration is an AWG with 220 nm SOI wafer.  The same specifications and parameters are considered.  For Si thickness, TE light exhibits a 3 nm .lamda.c shift and TM exhibits a 4.7 nm .lamda.c shift for a 1 nm change.  For
waveguide width, TE light exhibits a 0.6 nm .lamda.c shift and TM light exhibits a 0.3 nm .lamda.c shift for a 1 nm change.  Compared to the symmetric 300 nm SOI wafer configuration, this configuration shows much larger center wavelength sensitivities to
thickness variation.
<br/><br/> The third configuration is an Echelle grating, a type of diffraction grating characterized by relatively low groove density, with 300 nm SOI wafer.  The only specification considered here is crystalline Si thickness.  With TE light, a 0.7 nm
.lamda.c shift is exhibited for a 1 nm thickness change.  With TM light, a 1.8 nm .lamda.c shift is exhibited for a 1 nm thickness change.  Compared to the fourth configuration, the symmetric 300 nm SOI wafer shows benefits as well.  The fourth
configuration is an Echelle grating with 220 nm SOI wafer.  With TE light, a 1.2 nm .lamda.c shift is exhibited for a 1 nm thickness change.  With TM light, 4 nm .lamda.c shift is exhibited for a 1 nm thickness change.  Shown by the comparisons between
the 1.sup.st and 2.sup.nd configurations, as well as the 3.sup.rd and 4.sup.th configurations, it is shown that the 300 nm SOI wafer is less sensitive to Si thickness than the 220 nm SOI wafer.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the present invention provides various configurations of polarization diversity receivers.  These receivers can function in interferometric measurement and sensing systems and can include a PBS (Polarization Beam Splitter) or a
PBC (Polarization Beam Combiner).  FIGS. 3A-3D are simplified block diagrams illustrating polarization diversity receiver configurations according to various embodiments of the present invention.
<br/><br/> As shown, FIG. 3A depicts a configuration 301 with a TE+TM signal entering a PBS, which splits the signal into TE and TM signals.  The PBS is coupled to two demux (demultiplexer) blocks, each being optimized for one of the TE and TM signals. 
The TE signal directed to the TE demux, with one or more TE demux outputs, and the TM signal is directed to the TM demux, with one or more TM demux outputs.  The one or more TE demux outputs and one or more TM demux outputs are coupled in pairs to PDs
(Photo Diodes).  In a specific embodiment, if the path length of the demux outputs is long, delay lines may be needed to compensate time delay due to group index difference between the TE and TM signals.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3B depicts configuration 302 with a TE+TM signal entering a polarization dependent demux, which can be similar to the PBS coupled a TE optimized demux and a TM optimized demux.  Here, the path lengths of the various TE demux output lines
and the TM demux output lines are configured asymmetrically in order to match the time delay due to group index differences.  Similar to FIG. 3A, the TE and TM outputs from the demux blocks are shown to be coupled to photodiodes from opposite sides.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3C depicts configuration 303 with a PBS coupled to two separately optimized demux blocks, similar to FIG. 3A.  The path lengths of the demux block outputs are shown to be symmetric here, however, instead of the demux outputs being coupled
directly to photodiodes, they are first coupled to a PBC.  The output of the combiner is then coupled to the photodiode.  Compared to configurations 301 and 302, the TE and TM outputs are combined into a TE+TM output that is coupled to a photodiode on
one side.  In a specific embodiment, very compact PBS/PBC, directional coupler based or MMI (multimode interference) based, can be made in silicon photonics due to the material birefringence.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3D depicts configuration 304 with a PBS coupled to a polarization dependent demux.  Here, the PBS splits the TE and TM signals, which feed into the polarization dependent demux.  Input waveguide locations into the demux for TE and TM
signals can be chosen such that both the TE and TM signals focus into the identical waveguide.  This demux outputs TE+TM signal outputs coupled to photodiodes.  In this case, the path lengths to the photodiodes should be close enough such that the common
delay line works.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 4A-4C are simplified block diagrams illustrating coupling configurations for photodiodes according to various embodiments of the present invention.  These configurations can be applied to any of the configurations shown in FIGS. 3A-3D. 
FIG. 3A shows TE and TM signals coming from different sides of the PD.  FIG. 3B shows both TE and TM signals coming from the same side of the PD, though being offset from the center).  FIG. 3C shows TE and TM signals going into two separate PDs, both of
these PDs being electrically connected.  Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 5A-5D are simplified diagrams illustrating diffraction grating configurations according to various embodiments of the present invention.  As shown in FIG. 5A, AWG device 501 can include a first propagation region 510 and a second
propagation region 530 coupled together by grating waveguides 520.  Input coupler to the first propagation region 510 shows the input of a TE+TM signal.  These signals are diffracted from each grating waveguide and refocused at the second propagation
region 530.  The output of the second region 530 shows separate TE and TM signals denoted by numbered lambda symbols.  In a specific embodiment, the TE and TM signals come out of different locations due to index differences between the signals.  Due to
this index difference, the TE and TM signals are naturally separated into two separate focal regions.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5B shows a similar configuration to FIG. 5A, however the input signals at separate TE and TM signals into the first propagation region 510 and the output from the second propagation region are TE+TM signals denoted by lambda symbols.  By
having separation of the inputs for TE and TM (and having optimized locations), TE and TM come out of the same location.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, PBS and PBC devices can be constructed using the concepts shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B.  These ideas can also be applied to Echelle grating structures.  Using an MMI or a directional coupler, the device dimensions can be
optimized to take advantage of the birefringence in the material/waveguide to separate TE and TM modes.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5C shows a polarization independent multiplexer/demultiplexer using a repeating feature of AWG.  The same idea can be applied to Echelle grating.  Configuration 503 shows a similar structure to FIGS. 5A and 5B, with a first propagation
region 510 coupled to a second propagation region 530 by a diffraction grating structure 520.  As noted on the figure, the wavelengths with different diffraction orders (wavelengths are separated by n.times.FSR, n: integer, FSR: free spectral range)
focus to the same waveguide.  By adjusting the birefringence of grating arms in such a way that TE and TM lights with different grating orders focus to the same waveguide, (de)multiplexor can be polarization independent.
<br/><br/> As an example, two diffraction grating structures are considered (original .lamda.c defined by material index).  In these examples, TM light focuses to the same waveguide as TE light, but the grating order for TM light is m-1.  1.  AWG with 220
nm.times.450 nm WVG a. Grating order m=6 b. .lamda.c for TE=1300 nm c. .lamda.c for TM=1299.2 nm (=1082.5 nm+FSR) 2.  Echelle with 300 nm top Si a. Grating order m=12 b. .lamda.c for TE=1300 nm c. .lamda.c for TM=1299 nm (1190.7 nm+FSR)
<br/><br/> FIG. 5D depicts configuration 504 with an AWG having grating arm areas with 2 different indices.  This configuration shows a similar structure to FIGS. 5A-5C, with a first propagation region 510 coupled to a second propagation region 530 by a
diffraction grating structure 520.  However, the AWG structure 520 shown here includes grating arm areas defined by grating index structure 540.  The area of the waveguide gratings within the structure 540 is configured with a different index than the
waveguide gratings outside of structure 540.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6A is a simplified diagram illustrating an Echelle grating configuration according to an embodiment of the present invention.  Configuration 601 shows a single mode fiber input feeding into an input waveguide.  The output waveguides are
shown to be coming from the Echelle grating and directed to photo diodes.  The Echelle grating structure has an index compensator in its free propagation region, shown by the darkened region denoted by n' compared to the outer region denoted by n.
<br/><br/> Using this configuration, the following can be determined:
<br/><br/> .lamda.'.lamda.'.times..gamma.  ##EQU00001## .gamma..DELTA..times..times..DELTA..times..times.  ##EQU00001.2## .DELTA..times..times..times..times.  ##EQU00001.3## .DELTA..times..times.  ##EQU00001.4## where .lamda.' is the wavelength after
compensation, and .lamda.  is the wavelength before compensation Although this idea is known for compensating polarization dependence of Echelle grating, by these calculations, this configuration is shown to also reduce the sensitivity of .lamda.c to Si
thickness variation.  The same compensation idea can be applied in the AWG having 2 different index materials shown in FIG. 5D.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 .lamda.c sensitivity to Si thickness variation @ PI condition Echelle: .lamda.c sensitivity to Si thickness TE .lamda.c TM .lamda.c Top Si thickness Compensation sensitivity sensitivity 220 nm w/o compensation 1.28 nm/nm
3.50 nm/nm w/compensation 0.86 nm/nm 0.68 nm/nm 300 nm w/o compensation 0.65 nm/nm 1.53 nm/nm w/compensation 0.43 nm/nm 0.08 nm/nm
<br/><br/> Table 1 shown above further describes the differences of using different top silicon thicknesses and compensation.  With the 220 nm thickness, the TM .lamda.c sensitivity to Si thickness without compensation is noted to be very high compared to
the other values.  By adding compensator, TM .lamda.c sensitivity is reduced to 20% of the original value.  With the 300 nm top Si thickness, the sensitivity to Si thickness is less severe without compensator, and even less so with compensation.  Shown
by these numbers, different indices can be realized by different silicon core thicknesses (by partially etching the Si) or by depositing different cladding material (e.g. SiO.sub.2, SiN.sub.x, etc.).
<br/><br/> FIG. 6B is a simplified diagram illustrating an Echelle grating design according to an embodiment of the present invention.  More specifically, this design 602 shows a combination of SiO.sub.2 clad and Si.sub.3N.sub.4 clad for 300 nm Si.  These
two clad materials are shown with proportions according to the scale markings in nanometers.  The use of compensation materials such as these clad materials is a technique that is similar to the configuration shown in FIG. 5D.
<br/><br/> Depending on the application, the silicon photonics devices and diffraction grating configurations described previously can be implemented in various communication systems and interfaces.  Further details regarding embodiments of the
communications systems and interfaces are described below.
<br/><br/> In the last decades, with advent of cloud computing and data center, the needs for network servers have evolved.  For example, the three-level configuration that have been used for a long time is no longer adequate or suitable, as distributed
applications require flatter network architectures, where server virtualization that allows servers to operate in parallel.  For example, multiple servers can be used together to perform a requested task.  For multiple servers to work in parallel, it is
often imperative for them to be share large amount of information among themselves quickly, as opposed to having data going back forth through multiple layers of network architecture (e.g., network switches, etc.).
<br/><br/> Leaf-spine type of network architecture is provided to better allow servers to work in parallel and move data quickly among servers, offering high bandwidth and low latencies.  Typically, a leaf-spine network architecture uses a top-of-rack
switch that can directly access into server nodes and links back to a set of non-blocking spine switches that have enough bandwidth to allow for clusters of servers to be linked to one another and share large amount of data.
<br/><br/> In a typical leaf-spine network today, gigabits of data are shared among servers.  In certain network architectures, network servers on the same level have certain peer links for data sharing.  Unfortunately, the bandwidth for this type of set
up is often inadequate.  It is to be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention utilizes PAM (e.g., PAM8, PAM12, PAM16, etc.) in leaf-spine architecture that allows large amount (up terabytes of data at the spine level) of data to be
transferred via optical network.
