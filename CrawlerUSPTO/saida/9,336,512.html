       <p> Disclosed is computer implemented digital media systems and methods,
     including software application tools and related methods that employ a
     SOAP XML packet process or other software application or process to
     enable a user to embed, assemble and/or associate one or more digital
     elements (e.g., audio, video, or text), individually or collectively,
     with or within a digital element (e.g., an image), using a computer
     system such as a mobile, tablet or desktop device. For example, the
     disclosed photo application system and method empower users to
     automatically create a chronological timeline display of the user's
     photos uploaded into the system, to add text captions, voice, audio
     narration, and/or video clips that will play with a chronological
     slideshow. The disclosure provides a social networking application that
     allows users to uniquely create and share rich digital media content
     through applications, email, SMS/text, and transmission through
     interfaces with external applications.

<br/><br/> The present invention relates to a computer implemented digital media and social media systems and methods for computer systems, such as mobile, tablet and desktop devices for the creation, display and communication of multimedia based digital
content using voice, photo, image, and video methods and technologies.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> The present invention relates generally to the creation and sharing of dynamic digital content in social media for networking purposes but is also useful for industrial and medical application uses also.  Real-time social media tools have
afforded users the opportunity to actively interact and share information about their activities and their lives.  Embodiments of the invention provide new digital multimedia content for individuals and organizations to communicate and tell and share
their stories through mobile, tablet and desktop devices over public or private networks.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> The present invention discloses computer implemented systems and method, including software application tools and related methods employ a SOAP XML packet process or other software application or process to enable a user to create or use a
digital element, e.g., an image, including but not limited to a photo, web page, or other image, to embed, assemble and associate individually or collectively audio, video, or text (the latter which may be recognized and converted to audio with text
recognition software tools) in the form of, e.g., a voice comment in the photo or other image using a computer system such as a mobile, tablet or desktop device.  This pioneering and unique inventive system and method allows the user created content,
e.g., the embedded voice to travel with images or other data file thereby allowing recipients who receive the photo, image or other data file to simply launch the dynamic content by simply click on it or otherwise causing the dynamic content to launch in
order to listen and or view the dynamic content added to the photo, web page, other image, or data file received from the user.  According to the present invention, text captions and other communicative features can also be embedded, assembled or
associated and displayed with the photo, web page, or other image.  The embedding, assembling, or associating of static or dynamic (multimedia) files such as photos, images, pages or other data files may be referred to herein as PhotoTalk.  The reference
to photos also refers to pictures or other images.  The term images means any content that may be displayed.  The system and method uses SOAP (XML) packets to assemble multimedia data that includes photos, recorded voice, video and text created and
submitted to the social media network using the computer implement methods and systems software applications and services.  It is not required to use hypertext or hypermedia processes to assemble or present the multimedia elements to users.
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the present invention provides new digital media creation and sharing methods that expands the use of photos, voice, audio and video into a dynamic multi-media environment.  The invention expands the use of digital media in social
media, industrial and medical use.  The methods include embedding recorded voice into digital media, such as photos that can be listened to by clicking on the photo or image.  The computer implemented digital media and social media systems and methods
for computer systems also include embedding audio and video into static digital pages, such as electronic books, thereby allowing a user to listen to and video viewed on or from the audio and/or video embedded page(s) without being directed to a separate
screen or object.  The digital contents created are compatible with all known or contemplated digital pages, web sites, text editors and e-Readers and can be viewed and played on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.  The digital media content created
according to embodiments of the invention become alive on the page(s) and turns the pages into digital viewing screens for photos and videos and a speaker for audio content.
<br/><br/> The computer implemented systems and methods are particularly useful on social networks.  One or more users may be in communication with a social network engine via a public or private network.  The social network engine may comprise a social
networking website, one or more servers operating the social networking website, or any other device or application capable of providing social networking services via the network.  The users can access the services provided by the social network engine
via the network.  Optionally, one or more of the users may be able to access the social network engine directly.
<br/><br/> The users may use a computing device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, a cellular telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a set top box, and so forth to access the social network engine.  The users can view and exchange data and
files with and among the social network members, view a social timeline, enter data about themselves and possibly others, join social network groups, and so forth.  The users are typically members of a social networking website associated with the social
network engine, for example, and thus comprise the social network members.
<br/><br/> According to exemplary embodiments, a user identifies one or more other members associated with the social network engine, with which the user wants to build a relationship or establish or alter the details of an existing relationship.  Using
the social network engine, the user enters the details about the relationship.  The social network engine then sends data comprising the details from the user to the other users.  The user and the other users may then provide input in response to the
data.  The response may, for example, modify the data or create new data including image, audio, video, text and other data files.
<br/><br/> The relationship with the user and the other users may be confirmed, based on the input, by the social network engine.  Alternatively, the existence of the relationship may be denied, according to some embodiments.  Any type of confirmation
and/or input may be utilized to alter, deny, and/or establish the relationship between the user and the other users.
<br/><br/> The relationship may comprise any type of relationship that exists between two of the users.  For example, the two users may be family members, attend the same place of worship, have worked together, been classmates, be related, have dated, and
so forth.  More than one relationship may exist between the two users.  For example, the users may have the sample place of worship and be classmates.
<br/><br/> The data may then be ordered.  For example, a first user may specify that the relationship with a second user is older than the relationship with a third user.  In other words, the first user may enter detailed data that indicates calendar
dates, years, and other timing information about the relationship.  The social network engine can then order the data by the indicated times and generate a social timeline based on the ordered data.  The social timeline may indicate when certain events
related to the relationships occurred, for example, such as in the year 2012, the first user met the second user and began attending the same place of worship.  Any type of events, details, and other data related to the relationship may be provided by
the users and utilized to generate the social timeline.
<br/><br/> The social network engine may include a communications interface in association with the social network engine for receiving data from and sending data to the users.  The users can send any type of data to the social network engine via the
network and vice versa.  For example, a user can provide details about relationships with other users that the social network engine can utilize to generate the social timeline for the user based on the details.
<br/><br/> Typically, the users access a website associated with the social network engine.  For example, the social network engine may host a social networking website where the users can visit to interact with one another.  The website can display
various types of data about the users to one another, such as the social timeline, profile information, or relationships a particular user may have with other users.  The users may belong to particular communities within the social networking website,
such as communities categorized according to school attended, workplace, geographical location, and so forth.
<br/><br/> The social network engine can also generate and send communications to the users to transmit information about or information or other data associated with users between and among members of the social networking website.  The social network
engine may be utilized by the users to enter data about or otherwise desired to be transmitted to or be accessed by other users.
<br/><br/> The social network engine can store the user provided information and data in databases in hard drives, on CD ROMS, in DRAM, and so forth.  Any type of storage device or storage medium for storing information about or associated with the users
is within the scope of various embodiments.
<br/><br/> The same methods developed will allow individuals, Family Groups, Religious Organizations, Social Organizations, Businesses and Sports Organizations to easily create and share rich multimedia digital media content.  These computer implement
systems and methods according to the present invention involve a combination of text, photos, voice, audio and video that may be viewed in editable self-contained frames on digital pages.  The digital pages are referred to herein as LivePage and may be
viewed on computer systems such as mobile phones, tablet devises, cameras, video recorders, desktop/notebook/laptop computers, televisions, and networks.  Viewers will be able to read text, view photos that contain voice comments, listen to recorded
voice, listen to music, and play videos directly on the page or multiple pages, in the case of digital stories and books, giving the user a LivePage experience.  LivePage refers to digital items becoming alive for the viewers, by way of example on
viewable pages or through audio or video systems including computer systems.
<br/><br/> A further aspect of an embodiment of the invention provides that a photo can be taken on a mobile device, e.g., camera, camera phone, etc., using an application timer that can be set by the user to delay the time within which a mobile devise
camera will actually snap or otherwise take the photo.  This invention allows users to take a photo hands-free so they can be part of a photo without the assistance of another individual.
<br/><br/> A further aspect of an embodiment of the present invention allows users to uniquely create and share digital media content about their life experiences.  The present invention provides a software application service that helps users easily
create and share "their story" with current and future generations through social posts, which are by way of example referred to herein as My Life in Photos, My Story, My Inspiration and What's going on?.  Using a combination of text, photos, voice,
audio and video, users can share their user defined and created content, e.g., stories and legacies using the systems and methods of the invention's use on online social media networking.
<br/><br/> A further aspect of an embodiment of the present invention provides users with the capability to create and share their chronological photo story on a digital timeline (Life in Photos) that includes photos with embedded voice and videos that
play sequentially on the same digital slideshow, thereby allowing users to create and dynamically edit movies.
