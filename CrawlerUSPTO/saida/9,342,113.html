       <p> In one embodiment, a method includes, by a computing device, receiving
     sensor data from a sensor on the computing device indicating physical
     movement of the computing device. The method also includes determining a
     motion-trigger signal of the sensor data corresponding to a first
     characteristic of the physical movement of the computing device and a
     motion-confirm signal of the sensor data corresponding to a second
     characteristic of the physical movement of the computing device. The
     method further includes determining whether the motion-trigger signal
     includes a transition from within a pre-defined threshold band to outside
     of the pre-defined threshold band and whether the motion-confirm signal
     is within the pre-defined threshold band. The method also includes
     initiating a pre-defined action of the computing device when the
     motion-trigger signal includes the transition from within the pre-defined
     threshold band to outside the pre-defined threshold band and the
     motion-confirm signal is within the pre-defined threshold band.

<br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> This disclosure generally relates to mobile computing devices.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A mobile computing device--such as a smartphone, tablet computer, or laptop computer--may include functionality for determining its location, direction, or orientation, such as a GPS receiver, compass, gyroscope, or accelerometer.  Such a device
may also include functionality for wireless communication, such as BLUETOOTH communication, near-field communication (NFC), or infrared (IR) communication or communication with a wireless local area networks (WLANs) or cellular-telephone network.  Such a
device may also include one or more cameras, scanners, touchscreens, microphones, or speakers.  Mobile computing devices may also execute software applications, such as games, web browsers, or social-networking applications.  With social-networking
applications, users may connect, communicate, and share information with other users in their social networks.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a mobile computing device may determine that the device is undergoing a physical movement based on data from one or more motion sensors in the device.  The motion sensors may include an accelerometer, gyroscope, or
magnetometer, or any suitable combination thereof.  If the sensor data meets certain criteria, the mobile computing device may initiate a pre-defined action.  For example, the mobile computing device may be a smartphone displaying an image on its display
screen, and when a certain physical movement of the smartphone is sensed the pre-defined action may include zooming into or out of the image.  The physical movement may include a motion where the smartphone may be held in a user's hand and "flicked"
toward or away from the user in a rapid, jolting motion, and the flick movement may include translational motion along the vertical or longitudinal axis of the smartphone or a pitching rotational motion of the smartphone.  The physical movement may be
recognized by incorporating data from a gyroscope or an accelerometer and weighting the data according to the characteristics of the physical movement.  Moreover, a low-pass filter may be applied to the sensor data to reduce noise caused by hand tremors
or spurious mechanical movements or vibrations.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, to avoid unintentionally initiating an action, the mobile computing device may "lock out" the initiation of the action if certain other physical movements are sensed.  For example, a flick movement may be recognized
when there is (1) a translational movement along the vertical or longitudinal axis of the device or a pitching rotational motion and (2) a relatively small amount of rolling or yawing movement.  When an excessive amount of roll or yaw is sensed, the
device may prevent, or lock out, the initiation of the action.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the mobile computing device may monitor sensor data, predict a likelihood of completion of a physical movement based on the sensor data, and then partially initiate the corresponding action when the prediction attains
a threshold likelihood of completion.  Completion of the corresponding action may occur after the physical movement has been completed.  If the physical movement is not completed within a threshold period of time, the corresponding action may be revoked. For example, if the mobile computing device detects a 51% likelihood of a flick movement while monitoring sensor data, the device may commence scaling an image displayed on a screen to zoom in by 50%.  If the flick hand gesture is completed within a
pre-defined period of time, such as 300 ms, the zoom-in action will be completed to 100%; but if not, the image will be scaled back to its original size.
<br/><br/> The embodiments disclosed above are only examples, and the scope of this disclosure is not limited to them.  Particular embodiments may include all, some, or none of the components, elements, features, functions, operations, or steps of the
embodiments disclosed above. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example mobile computing device 100 having a front surface 110.  In particular embodiments, mobile computing device 100 may be a single-board computer (SBC) (such as, for example, a computer-on-module (COM) or
system-on-module (SOM)), a laptop or notebook computer, a mobile telephone, a smartphone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer system, or a combination of two or more of these.  Mobile computing device 100 may include one or more
integrated display screens or an interface to one or more external display screens.  Front surface 110 of mobile computing device 100 may include a display screen.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable mobile computing device 100 taking any suitable
physical form.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates example translational axes 120 for characterizing translational movement of mobile computing device 100 and example rotational axes 130 for characterizing rotational movement of mobile computing device 100.  A physical
movement of mobile computing device 100 may include a rotational or translational displacement, velocity, acceleration, or any other suitable higher-order characteristic of motion, or any suitable combination thereof X-axis 120a, which may be referred to
as the lateral axis, and Y-axis 120b, which may be referred to as the longitudinal axis, may be orthogonal to each other and may lie in the plane of front surface 110.  Z-axis 120c, which may be referred to as the vertical axis, may be orthogonal to
front surface 110.  .THETA..sub.x-axis 130a, which may be referred to as the pitch axis, may be used to characterize pitching, or the rotational movement of mobile computing device 100 about X-axis 120a.  .THETA..sub.y-axis 130b, which may be referred to
as the roll axis, may be used to characterize rolling, or the rotational movement of mobile computing device 100 about Y-axis 120b.  .THETA..sub.z-axis 130c, which may be referred to as the yaw axis, may be used to characterize yawing, or the rotational
movement of mobile computing device 100 about Z-axis 120c.  Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular axes for describing position, orientation, or movement of mobile computing device 100, this disclosure contemplates any suitable axes
having any suitable orientations.  Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular physical movements of mobile computing device 100, including rotational or translational displacement, velocity, or acceleration, this disclosure contemplates
any suitable movements or combinations of suitable movements, including any suitable higher-order characteristics of motion, such as jerk or jounce.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, mobile computing device 100 may include one or more types of sensors for detecting position, orientation, translational movement, or rotational movement of mobile computing device 100.  The motion sensors may include
an accelerometer, gyroscope, or magnetometer, or any suitable combination thereof.  Mobile computing device 100 may also include an interface to one or more external sensors for detecting position or movement.  Although this disclosure describes
particular sensors for detecting position, orientation, or movement of mobile computing device 100, this disclosure contemplates any suitable sensors for detecting position, orientation, or movement.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, an accelerometer may be used to determine the translational movement of mobile computing device 100 along any of translational axes 120.  For example, the accelerometer sensor data may be used to determine the linear
acceleration of mobile computing device 100 along axes 120.  Moreover, integrating (or averaging) the accelerometer data over a particular time interval may be used to determine the velocity of mobile computing device 100 along axes 120.  Other
higher-order characteristics of translational motion of mobile computing device 100 along axes 120 may be determined by taking one or more derivatives with respect to time of the accelerometer data.  In particular embodiments, a derivative signal may be
obtained by calculating the difference between sensor data obtained at two different times.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a gyroscope may be used to determine orientation or rotational movement of mobile computing device 100 along any of rotational axes 130.  For example, the gyroscope sensor data may be used to determine the angular
orientation of mobile computing device 100 along axes 130.  By taking the first derivative with respect to time of the gyroscope data, the rotational (or angular) velocity of mobile computing device 100 along axes 130 may be determined.  The second
derivative of the gyroscope data may be used to determine the rotational (or angular) acceleration of mobile computing device 100 along axes 130.  Taking additional higher-order derivatives may be used to determine additional higher-order characteristics
of rotational motion of mobile compute device 100 along axes 130.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a magnetometer (e.g., a magnetic field sensor) may be used to measure orientation or rotational movement of mobile computing device 100 along any of rotational axes 130.  The magnetometer may sense the earth's magnetic
field or any other suitable, substantially static magnetic field to determine the angular orientation of mobile computing device 100.  By taking the first derivative with respect to time of the magnetometer data, the rotational velocity of mobile
computing device 100 along axes 130 may be determined.  The second derivative of the magnetometer data may be used to determine the rotational acceleration of mobile computing device 100 along axes 130.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 2A-2B illustrate an example mobile computing device 100 undergoing an example physical movement.  FIG. 2A illustrates mobile computing device 100 oriented in a substantially upright position.  FIG. 2B illustrates mobile computing device
100 after undergoing a physical movement as indicated by the arrows, where the movement may include a translational movement or a rotational movement.  The original position of mobile computing device 100 from FIG. 2A is indicated by a dashed outline in
FIG. 2B.  In particular embodiments, mobile computing device 100 may be held in a user's hand while undergoing a physical movement as illustrated in FIGS. 2A and 2B.  In particular embodiments, a physical movement may include a motion where mobile
computing device 100 is held in a user's hand and "flicked" away from the user in a rapid, jolting motion.  A flick movement may include a displacement, velocity, or acceleration along Z-axis 120c (e.g., perpendicular to front surface 110); a
displacement, velocity, or acceleration along Y-axis 120b (the longitudinal axis); or a pitching rotational displacement, velocity, or acceleration along .THETA..sub.x-axis 130a.  Moreover, relative to the previously recited movements, a flick movement
may include only a small component of the following: displacement, velocity, or acceleration along X-axis 120a (the transverse axis); rolling rotational displacement, velocity, or acceleration along .THETA..sub.y-axis 130b; or yawing rotational
displacement, velocity, or acceleration along .THETA..sub.z-axis 130c.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a physical movement may include a motion where mobile computing device 100 is held in a user's hand and flicked toward the user.  In particular embodiments, a physical movement may include a lateral motion along X-axis
120a where mobile computing device 100 is moved sideways.  In particular embodiments, a physical movement may include a twisting motion where mobile computing device 100 undergoes a rolling rotation motion along .THETA..sub.y-axis 130b or a yawing
rotational motion along .THETA..sub.x-axis 130c.  In particular embodiments, a physical movement may include a translational movement along any of axes 120 or a rotational movement along any of axes 130, or any suitable combination of movements along any
suitable axes.  Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular physical movements along particular axes, this disclosure contemplates any suitable physical movements or any suitable combination of physical movement along any suitable axes.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates example signals 300 and 310 computed from sensor data of one or more sensors on mobile computing device 100.  Example sensor signals 300 and 310 may be in the form of a time-varying magnitude where time is indicated by
horizontal axis 320 and sensor-signal magnitude is indicated by vertical axis 330.  A pre-defined threshold band 340 may be represented by horizontal dashed lines 340a and 340b, where line 340a indicates a lower limit and line 340b indicates an upper
limit of threshold band 340.  In particular embodiments, sensor signal 300 may be defined as a motion-trigger signal, and sensor signal 310 may be defined as a motion-confirm signal.
<br/><br/> A motion-trigger signal 300 may be a measure of a first physical movement of mobile computing device 100 potentially indicating user input intended by the user to trigger an action, and it may include unprocessed sensor data from one or more
sensors, sensor data from one or more sensors multiplied by a scaling or weighting factor, sensor data processed by a low-pass filter, or other suitable processed or unprocessed sensor data.  A motion-confirm signal 310 may provide a contraindication of
a motion-trigger signal 300.  For example, a motion-confirm signal 310 may be a measure of a second physical movement of mobile computing device 100 potentially indicating that the user did not intend to trigger an action, and similar to a motion-trigger
signal it may include unprocessed sensor data from one or more sensors, sensor data from one or more sensors multiplied by a scaling or weighting factor, sensor data processed by a low-pass filter, or other suitable processed or unprocessed sensor data. 
For example, for a particular physical movement of mobile computing device 100, motion-trigger signal 300 may correspond to one characteristic of the physical movement, and motion-confirm signal 310 may correspond to a second characteristic of the
physical movement.  For example, motion-trigger signal 300 may correspond to movement that may be expected to occur and motion-confirm signal 310 may correspond to movement that may not be expected to occur in a significant amount during the particular
physical movement.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, as described above, the physical movement may include a motion where mobile computing device 100 is held in a user's hand and flicked away from the user.  In the example of a flick movement, motion-trigger signal 300
may be computed from data of one or more sensors, including, by way of example and not limitation, displacement, velocity, or acceleration along Z-axis 120c (i.e., perpendicular to front surface 110); displacement, velocity, or acceleration along Y-axis
120b (the longitudinal axis); or a pitching rotational displacement, velocity, or acceleration along .THETA..sub.x-axis 130a.  Moreover, motion-trigger signal 300 may be computed by weighting data from one or more sensors in order to closely match
motion-trigger signal 300 with the expected first characteristic of the physical movement.  For example, in particular embodiments, motion-trigger signal 300 may be computed as follows: MTS=.alpha.A.sub.z+bA.sub.y, where MTS is motion-trigger signal 300,
a and b are weighting (or scaling) factors, and A.sub.z and A.sub.y are the acceleration along Z-axis 120c and Y-axis 120b, respectively.  In the example of a flick movement, motion-confirm signal 310 may be computed from data of one or more sensors,
including, by way of example and not limitation, displacement, velocity, or acceleration along X-axis 120a (the transverse axis); rolling rotational displacement, velocity, or acceleration along .THETA..sub.y-axis 130b; or yawing rotational displacement,
velocity, or acceleration along .THETA..sub.z-axis 130c.  Moreover, motion-confirm signal 310 may be computed by weighting data from one or more sensors in order to closely match motion-trigger signal 310 with the expected second characteristic of the
physical movement.  For example, in particular embodiments, motion-confirm signal 310 may be computed as follows: MCS=c.beta..sub.y+d.beta..sub.z, where MCS is motion-confirm signal 310, c and d are weighting (or scaling) factors, and .beta..sub.y and
.beta..sub.z are the angular orientation along .THETA..sub.y-axis 130b and .THETA..sub.z-axis 130c, respectively.  In particular embodiments, a low-pass filter may be applied to sensor data, motion-trigger signal 300, or motion-confirm signal 310 to
reduce noise caused by hand tremors or spurious mechanical movements or vibrations.  Although this disclosure describes particular motion-trigger signals 300 and motion-confirm signals 310, this disclosure contemplates any suitable motion-trigger and
motion-confirm signals.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, mobile computing device 100 may determine that the device is undergoing a particular physical movement based on motion-trigger signal 300 and motion-confirm signal 310.  If motion-trigger signal 300 and motion-confirm
signal 310 meet certain criteria, mobile computing device 100 may initiate a pre-defined action.  A pre-defined action of mobile computing device 100 may be any suitable function, task, or operation that mobile computing device 100 is configured to
perform, where appropriate.  For example, mobile computing device 100 may be a smartphone displaying an image on its display screen, and when the smartphone is flicked away from the user, the smartphone may zoom in on the image.  If the smartphone is
flicked away from the user again, the smartphone may zoom out of the image to display it in its original size.  In this example embodiment, the pre-defined action initiated by mobile computing device 100 may include zooming into or out of an image. 
Other example actions that may be initiated by mobile computing device 100 in response to a particular physical movement may include, by way of example and not limitation, answering or ending a phone call; increasing or decreasing a speaker volume;
switching between applications; increasing or decreasing a display brightness; waking mobile computing device 100 from a sleep state; or putting mobile device 100 into a sleep state.  Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular
pre-defined actions that may be initiated by a mobile computing device 100 in response to a physical movement, this disclosure contemplates any suitable pre-defined actions.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the criteria where mobile computing device 100 determines whether to trigger, or initiate, a pre-defined action may include motion-trigger signal 300 making one or more transitions from within threshold band 340 to
outside of threshold band 340.  In the example of a flick movement, mobile computing device 100 may undergo a rapid translational acceleration followed by a rapid translational deceleration, and motion-trigger signal 300 may exhibit a corresponding rapid
increase to a positive peak followed by a rapid decrease to a negative peak.  Such an example flick movement is exhibited by signal portion 350a in FIG. 3.  In particular embodiments, to avoid unintentionally initiating an action, mobile computing device
100 may "lock out" an initiation of an action if certain other physical movements, represented by motion-confirm signal 310, are sensed.  For example, the criteria where mobile computing device 100 determines whether to initiate an action may also
include motion-confirm signal 310 being located within threshold band 340.  As discussed above, motion-confirm signal 310 may depend on angular orientation along .THETA..sub.y-axis 130b (e.g., roll) and .THETA..sub.z-axis 130c (e.g., yaw).  When a
rolling or yawing motion is sensed, motion-confirm signal 310 may increase or decrease, and if an excessive amount of roll or yaw is sensed, motion-confirm signal 310 may exceed the limits of threshold band 340.  If motion-confirm signal 310 exceeds the
limits of threshold band 340, mobile computing device 100 may prevent, or lock out, the initiation of the action.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 3, signal portion 350a shows example motion-trigger signal 300 exhibiting a positive peak that includes a transition from within threshold band 340 to outside of threshold band 340 and a negative peak that includes a transition from
within to outside of threshold band 340.  Moreover, signal portion 350a shows that example motion-confirm signal 310 is within threshold band 340.  In this example, signal portion 350a corresponds to a flick movement without an excessive amount of roll
or yaw motion, and so, mobile computing device 100 may initiate a pre-defined action, as indicated by a check mark labeling signal portion 350a.  Signal portions 350b, 350c, and 350d in FIG. 3 are labeled with an "X" mark indicating a lock-out condition
where mobile computing device 100 may not initiate a pre-defined action.  In signal portion 350b, motion-trigger signal 300 exhibits a positive and a negative peak but does not make a transition from within to outside of threshold band 340, indicating
that a flick-type movement may have occurred but was not strong enough to trigger an action.  In signal portion 350c, motion-trigger signal 300 indicates a flick movement has occurred, but motion-trigger signal 310 is located outside threshold band 340,
indicating an excessive amount of other physical movement.  And so, in signal portion 350c, mobile computing device 100 may not initiate a pre-defined action.  In signal portion 350d, motion-trigger signal 300 indicates some physical movement, but the
amplitude and shape of motion-trigger signal 300 do not correspond to the pre-defined expected movement that triggers an action.  So, for signal portion 350d, no action may be triggered by mobile computing device 100.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, mobile computing device 100 may apply a peak-hold function to motion-confirm signal 310, where a maximum value of motion-confirm signal 310 is made to persist for a pre-defined period of time.  For example, if a sudden
or spurious physical movement of mobile computing device 100 occurs, such as dropping the device, motion-confirm signal 310 may suddenly spike up to an elevated value outside of threshold band 340 and then recover to a value inside threshold band 340.  A
peak-hold function applied to motion-confirm signal 310 may keep motion-confirm signal 310 at the elevated value for a certain period of time, such as 200 ms, after the sudden physical movement has ceased.  Over this time period, an action lock-out
condition will persist so that an action cannot be initiated.  Applying a peak-hold function to motion-confirm signal 310 may prevent the triggering of an action by certain unintentional or spurious physical movements.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, mobile computing device 100 may monitor sensor signals 300 and 310 and predict a likelihood (or probability) of completion of a physical movement, and then partially initiate the corresponding action when the
prediction attains a threshold likelihood of completion.  Completion of the corresponding action may occur after the physical movement has been completed.  If the physical movement is not completed within a certain period of time, the corresponding
action may be revoked.  For example, if mobile computing device 100 detects a 51% likelihood of a flick movement while monitoring sensor signals, device 100 may partially initiate an action, such as scaling an image displayed on a screen to zoom in by
50%.  If the flick movement is completed within a pre-defined period of time, such as 300 ms, the zoom-in action will be completed to 100%; but if not, the image will be scaled back to its original size.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the speed with which an action is performed by mobile computing device 100 may be affected by the size (or amplitude) of motion-trigger signal 300.  For an example action where a physical motion initiates zooming into
or out of an image, the speed with which the image-zoom action occurs may be proportional to the size of motion-trigger signal 300.  For example, if a user makes a flick movement that occurs relatively slowly, the image may be zoomed into at a relatively
slow speed.  Alternately, if a user makes a flick movement that occurs relatively quickly, zooming into the image may also occur relatively quickly.  In another example embodiment, the amount of an action performed by mobile computing device 100 may be
affected by the size of motion-trigger signal 300.  For an example where a physical movement triggers an audio volume adjustment of mobile computing device 100, if a user makes a slow flick movement, the volume may be increased or decreased by a
relatively small increment.  And if a user makes a quick flick movement, the volume may be increased or decreased by a relatively large increment.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, one or more distinct physical movements may initiate one or more corresponding distinct actions by mobile computing device 100.  For example, a flick movement may initiate one action, such as zooming into or out of an
image, and a rolling movement may initiate some other action, such as audio volume adjustment.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable number of suitable physical movements that may be used to initiate any suitable number of corresponding actions by a
mobile computing device 100.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates an example method 400 for determining a physical movement of a mobile computing device 100 and initiating an action of mobile computing device 100.  The method may begin at step 410, where data from a sensor on mobile
computing device 100 may be received, and where the data may indicate physical movement of mobile computing device 100.  At step 420 a motion-trigger signal 300 that corresponds to a first characteristic of the physical movement may be determined.  At
step 430 a motion-confirm signal 310 that corresponds to a second characteristic of the physical movement may be determined.  At step 440 it may be determined whether motion-trigger signal 300 has a transition from within to outside of a pre-defined
threshold band 340 and whether motion-confirm signal 310 is within pre-defined threshold band 340.  At step 450 a pre-defined action of mobile computing device 100 may be initiated, at which point the method may end.  Particular embodiments may repeat
one or more steps of the method of FIG. 4, where appropriate.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of FIG. 4 as occurring in a particular order, this disclosure contemplates any suitable steps of the method
of FIG. 4 occurring in any suitable order.  Moreover, although this disclosure describes and illustrates an example method for determining a physical movement of a mobile computing device 100 and initiating an action of mobile computing device 100,
including the particular steps of the method of FIG. 4, this disclosure contemplates any suitable method for determining a physical movement of mobile computing device 100 and initiating an action of mobile computing device 100, including any suitable
steps, which may include all, some, or none of the steps of the method of FIG. 4, where appropriate.  Furthermore, although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components, devices, or systems carrying out particular steps of the method
of FIG. 4, this disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components, devices, or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of FIG. 4.

position and has a display screen included on its front surface 110.  An image may be displayed on the display screen, and in particular embodiments, a flick movement of mobile computing device may initiate an action of zooming into the image.  FIG. 5B
shows mobile computing device 100 after undergoing a flick movement with a zoomed-in portion of the image from FIG. 5A displayed on the screen.
