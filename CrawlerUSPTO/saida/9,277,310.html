<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
<br/><br/> Not Applicable.
<br/><br/>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> This invention relates to audio playback systems, and more particularly to an audio playback system with a remote control.
<br/><br/>DISCUSSION OF RELATED ART
<br/><br/> Current audio playback transducers such as speakers, earphones, headphones, and the like provide minimal control capabilities for the audio output of an audio output device.  Volume control and on/off controls are about the limit when providing
on-headphone control of the audio output of such prior art devices.  While some headphone prior art devices include a remote control, none of the prior art allows for a remote control easily removable from the headphones and then worn on a person's
clothing, wrist, or the like.  Further, such prior art remote controls are significantly limited in their functionality and do not provide options to the user for changing an audio source, for example.
<br/><br/> Therefore, there is a need for a device that allow for convenient wearing of a remote control for a headphone arrangement, and for playback of an audio signal from an audio output device through the headphone arrangement.  Such a needed device
would provide for controlling an audio output of the headphone arrangement directly by sending control signals to the headphone arrangement, or indirectly by sending control signals to the audio output device.  Alternately, the needed device would
control the audio output of the headphone arrangement by sending a modified audio signal received from the audio output device or wide area network to the headphone arrangement.  Such a needed invention would allow easy storing of the remote and a
personal attachment within the headphone arrangement while not in use.  The present invention accomplishes these objectives.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present device is an audio playback system for an audio signal generated by an audio output device.  A generally U-shaped headphone arrangement has two opposing ends each terminating with an audio transducer.
<br/><br/> A top enclosure of the headphone arrangement includes a remote control holder, a remote sensor such as a switch, a personal attachment holder, and a headphone circuit.  The headphone circuit includes a signal input adapted to receive the audio
signal generated by the audio output device, a power source, a wireless control signal input, and an audio output that is electrically connected with each audio transducer.  The signal input of the headphone circuit may be a wireless signal receiver for
receiving a wireless audio signal.
<br/><br/> The audio playback system further includes a remote control that comprises an enclosure adapted for selective engagement with the remote control holder of the headphone arrangement.  Further, the remote control is subject to detection by the

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
<br/><br/> Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below.  The following explanation provides specific details for a thorough understanding of and enabling description for these embodiments.  One skilled in the art will understand that the
invention may be practiced without such details.  In other instances, well-known structures and functions have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the embodiments.
<br/><br/> Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words "comprise," "comprising," and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say,
in the sense of "including, but not limited to." Words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number respectively.  Additionally, the words "herein," "above," "below" and words of similar import, when used in this
application, shall refer to this application as a whole and not to any particular portions of this application.  When the claims use the word "or" in reference to a list of two or more items, that word covers all of the following interpretations of the
word: any of the items in the list, all of the items in the list and any combination of the items in the list.  When the word "each" is used to refer to an element that was previously introduced as being at least one in number, the word "each" does not
necessarily imply a plurality of the elements, but can also mean a singular element.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 1A-2B and 4A-4B illustrate an audio playback system 10 for an audio signal 21 generated by an audio output device 20, such as an audio receiver, a portable media or mp3 player, a laptop or desktop computer, a notebook or tablet-type
computer, a cellular or "smart" phone, a game player or console, a television, cable box, a network-connected media player, a home or portable entertainment system, or the like.
<br/><br/> A generally U-shaped headphone arrangement 40 has two opposing ends 45 each terminating with an audio transducer 50, such as a speaker.  Each audio transducer 50 preferably pivots on a pivot arrangement (FIG. 3B) that allows the angular position
of each audio transducer 50 with respect to a person's head 33 to be adjusted as suited by the person 30.  The headphone arrangement 40 is preferably padded for comfort against the person's head, and each transducer 50 may be adjusted vertically with
respect to the headphone arrangement 40 to adapt to the size of the person 30 (FIG. 3A).
<br/><br/> A top enclosure 60 of the headphone arrangement 40 includes a remote control holder 70, a remote sensor 80 such as a switch 81 (FIG. 6), a personal attachment holder 90 (FIGS. 2A and 3C), and a headphone circuit 100.  The top enclosure 60 may be
a rigid enclosure, preferably padded, and preferably made from a lightweight material such as plastic, steel, aluminum, carbon fiber materials, Kevlar-type materials, or other suitable materials.
<br/><br/> The headphone circuit 100 includes a signal input 110 adapted to receive the audio signal 21 generated by the audio output device 20, a power source 120 such as a battery or an AC adapter output, a wireless control signal input 130, and an audio
output 140 that is electrically connected with each audio transducer 50.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment the signal input 110 is an electronic jack 250 traversing the headphone arrangement 40 (preferably towards the bottom of one of the audio transducers 50) and adapted for selectively receiving an audio plug 23 of an audio signal
line 24 that is electrically connected with the audio output device 20.  The audio plug 23 and audio signal line 24 are not part of the claimed invention but rather can be purchased from any electronics store.
<br/><br/> Alternately, the signal input 110 of the headphone circuit 100 may be a wireless signal receiver 111 for receiving a wireless audio signal 22, such as may be broadcast by the audio output device 20 (FIG. 5B), a wireless network (FIG. 8A), a
Bluetooth-type device, a cellular data network, an FM or AM broadcast tower, satellite network, or the like.  In one embodiment, a auxiliary wireless broadcast transmitter (not shown) may be included that converts the audio signal 21 into the wireless
audio signal 22 for reception by the headphone circuit 100.  Such an auxiliary wireless broadcast transmitter may be plugged into a headphone jack (not shown) of the audio output device 20, for example, obtaining the audio signal 21 from the headphone
jack and then converting it to the wireless audio signal 22.
<br/><br/> The audio playback system further includes a remote control 150 that comprises an enclosure 160 adapted for selective engagement with the remote control holder 70 of the headphone arrangement 40.  Further, the remote control 150 is subject to
detection by the remote sensor 80.  The remote control 150 further includes a remote circuit 360 having a control signal transmitter 170, a power source 180 such as a rechargeable battery, removable lithium-ion batteries, AA or AAA batteries, or an AC
adapter output, and a user interface 190.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the remote circuit 360 further includes a second signal input 260 adapted to receive the audio signal 21 generated by the audio output device 20, and an audio signal transmitter 270 adapted for transmitting the audio signal 21
to the signal input 110 of the headphone circuit 100 (FIG. 5A).  In such an embodiment, the headphone circuit 100 receives the audio signal 21 from the remote control 150, not from the audio output device 20 itself.  A selector switch or control (not
shown) may be included for toggling between signal inputs of either the audio output device 20 or the remote control 150, for example.  The second signal input 260 of the remote circuit 360 may be one of the electronic jacks 250 (FIG. 10A), for example. 
Alternately, the second signal input 260 of the remote circuit 360 may be one of the wireless signal receivers 111 for receiving the wireless audio signal 22.
<br/><br/> Preferably the user interface 190 of the remote control 150 includes a touch-sensitive display screen 191, such that variable user interface controls 192 are displayed to the person 30 on the display screen 191 and changed by the person 30
interacting with the display screen 191.  The remote circuit 360 in such an embodiment further includes at least a processor 280 for displaying the interface controls 192 and storing their values in a memory 290.
<br/><br/> The control signal transmitter 170 is configured for sending control signals 230 to the control signal input 130 of the headphone circuit 100, such as volume control signals for affecting a change in the volume of the audio output through the
audio transducers 50, balance control signals for changing the relative volume between the two audio transducers 50, on/off commands for turning the audio transducers 50 off, and the like.  In one embodiment, the control signal transmitter 170 is
configured for sending the control signals 230 to both the headphone arrangement 40 and, wherein the audio output device 20 includes a two-way wireless receiver, to the audio output device 20.  In such an embodiment the remote control 150 may be used to
send control signals 230 to the audio output device 20 such as the commands listed above, plus audio signal input selection, skip track or back commands, a pause command, or the like.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the user interface 190 of the remote control 150 further includes a microphone 193 and the remote circuit 360 is adapted for receiving commands from the person 30 by voice recognition.  Further, the user interface 190 may
include a camera 194, and the remote circuit 360 may be adapted for receiving commands from the person 30 by gesture recognition.  Still further, the user interface 190 may include at least one tilt sensor 195, such that the remote circuit 360 may
receive commands from the person 30 by tilting of the remote control 150.
<br/><br/> Preferably the headphone circuit 100 further includes a second tilt sensor 310 and a feedback transmitter 320, and the remote circuit 360 further includes a feedback signal receiver 330, such that upon detection by the second tilt sensor 310
that the orientation of the headphone arrangement 40 has been changed by the person 30, the headphone circuit 100 sends a feedback signal to the remote control circuit 360 whereby the remote circuit 360 takes a pre-programmed action.  Such a
pre-programmed action may be, for example, sending a "pause" command to the audio output device 20 upon the second tilt sensor 310 detecting that the headphone arrangement 40 has assumed a horizontal orientation 340 (FIG. 9A), or sending an "off" command
to the headphone circuit 100 to turn the audio transducers 50 off to save battery power when the headphone arrangement 40 is in the horizontal orientation 340.  Alternately, the pre-programmed action may be sending a "play" command to the audio output
device 20 through the control signal transmitter 170 in response to the second tilt sensor 310 detecting that the headphone arrangement 40 has assumed a vertical orientation 350 (FIG. 9B), for example.  Such commands may also be sent upon detection of
the switch 81 that the remote control 150 has been reengaged with the remote control holder 70 of the headphone arrangement 70.  Many of the above commands may also include a command for the remote circuit 360 to turn on or off the display screen 191. 
For example, when the remote control 150 is reengaged with the remote control holder 70, as determined by the remote sensor 80, the headphone circuit 100 and remote circuit 360 may assume a reduced power-consumption hibernation or standby state with the
audio transducers 50 off and the display screen 191 off.
<br/><br/> In one preferred embodiment, the remote circuit 360 further includes a wireless interface 300 accessible through a wireless communications network 15 (FIG. 8B).  The wireless interface 300 in such an embodiment is adapted for loading selected
software applications into the memory 290 through the wireless communications network 15, such as a digital clock application, for example (FIG. 2A).  The remote circuit 360 further includes an operating system programmed into the memory for controlling
the user interface 190.  In such an embodiment the wireless audio signal 22 may additionally be received over the remote control 1 150 receives the wireless audio signal 22, modifies it for proper volume, balance, equalization, and the like, and then
broadcasts the modified audio signal 22 to the headphone arrangement 40 (FIG. 8A).  Alternately, the remote control 150 sends control signals 230 through the network 15 so that the audio output device 20 connected with the network 15 is controlled
thereby, the headphone arrangement 40 adapted for receiving the modified audio signal 21 through the network 15 (FIG. 8B).  Alternately, the remote control 150 may send control signals 230 to the headphone arrangement 40, which then either modifies the
audio signal 21 directly or forwards the control signals 230 to the audio output device 20 through the network 15 (FIG. 8C).  In such embodiments the audio output device 15 may be, for example, a remote website or music service delivered over the
Internet or through a local WAN or LAN.  It is understood that in the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 8A-8C that the network 15 acts as the audio output device 20, and there may be no physical audio output device 20.
<br/><br/> In such an embodiment having the operating system and a microphone 193, and wherein the audio output device 20 includes a telephone function, upon detection of a phone call on the audio output device 20 the remote circuit 360 may display an
"answer phone" and "disregard" interface control 192 on the display screen 191.  Upon the user 30 actuating the "answer phone" interface control 192, the remote circuit 360 may issue a "pause" command to the audio output device 20 if the audio output
device 20 does not already have this feature, and send voice signals back to the audio output device 20 so that the audio playback system 10 acts as a remote Bluetooth-type headset.
<br/><br/> The remote control holder 70 is preferably a recess in the top enclosure 60 that includes a remote control release 240 with a remote control catch 245 mechanically operable with the remote control release 240.  Upon actuation of the remote
control release 240 the remote control catch 245 releases the remote control 150 from the recess.  When the remote control 150 is placed back into the remote control holder 70 preferably the remote control 150, remote control release 240 and the top
enclosure 60 are substantially flush.  Alternately the remote control holder 70 may be a compartment or pocket (not shown) in the top enclosure 60, with or without a hinged or resilient cover (not shown).  Alternately, the remote control holder 70 may be
a two-part mechanical fastener such as a mechanical snap, hook-and-loop type fastener, or the like (not shown).
<br/><br/> A personal attachment 200 is adapted to be fixed with the enclosure 160 of the remote control 150 and, in a worn configuration 210, for attachment with the person 30.  In a stowed configuration 220 the personal attachment 200 is fixed with the
personal attachment holder 90 of the headphone arrangement 40.  The personal attachment 200 may be, for example, a bracelet or wristband 201 that is selectively engageable with the remote control enclosure 160 and storable in the personal attachment
holder 90 of the headphone arrangement 40.  In one embodiment a second switch 81 (not shown) is fixed with the personal attachment holder 90 for detecting if the personal attachment 200 is present in the personal attachment holder 90, whereby the
headphone circuit 100 may take one of a number of pre-programmed actions such as turning the audio transducers 50 on or off, for example.  The personal attachment 200 may also be, in alternate embodiments, a slap bracelet, band, strap, armband, or the
like (all not shown).  In one embodiment, the wristband 201 and remote control enclosure 160 are integrally formed.
<br/><br/> Alternately, the personal attachment 200 is a mechanical spring-biased clasp 202 (FIG. 11) fixed with the remote control enclosure 160 and adapted to be selectively attached with a garment 31 of the person 30.  In such an embodiment, the
personal attachment holder 90 and the remote control holder 70 are mutually integrated (FIGS. 10A-10B) and may form a common compartment in the top enclosure 60 of the headphone arrangement 40.  In yet another embodiment, the personal attachment 200 is a
necklace 203 selectively fixed with the remote control enclosure 160 and adapted for selective attachment about the neck 32 of the person.  The necklace 203 may be stored in the personal attachment holder 90 separate from the remote control 150, or fixed
therewith in an embodiment having a combined personal attachment holder 90 and remote control holder 70.
<br/><br/> In use, the person 30 detaches the remote control 150 from the remote control holder 70, and the personal attachment 200 from the personal attachment holder 90 and affixes the remote control 150 to the personal attachment 200, if necessary.  The
person 30 then wears the personal attachment 200.  Control signals 230 are transmitted to the control signal input 130 of the headphone arrangement 40 by the control signal transmitter 170 in response to the person 30 interacting with the user interface
190.  The headphone circuit 100 alters the audio output of the headphone circuit 100 in accordance thereto.  When the person 30 is finished listening to the audio output the personal attachment 200 and the remote control 150 are stowed in the headphone
arrangement 40, whereby the headphone circuit 100 is deactivated by the remote sensor 80.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the invention, the headphone circuit 100 further includes one of the microphones 193 (FIG. 9A) and the feedback transmitter 320, and the remote circuit 360 further includes one of the feedback signal receivers 330.  As such,
the remote circuit 360 is adapted for receiving a headphone audio signal from the microphone 193 through the headphone circuit 100 and feedback transmitter 320.  Either alternately or in addition, the headphone circuit 100 further includes one of the
cameras 194 (FIG. 9B), such that the remote circuit 360 is adapted for receiving a video signal from the camera 194 through the headphone circuit 100 and feedback transmitter 320.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the headphone circuit 100 further includes one of the processors 280 and memory 290 (FIG. 7) and is adapted to decompress a compressed audio signal 21 or compressed wireless audio signal 22, or to decode an encoded audio
signal 21 or encoded wireless audio signal 22.

<br/><br/> User Preferences exist within the File Manager and Graphic User Interface, GUI, of the digital display device 1102, or can be downloaded by the user onto to their electronic device, such as a `smart-connected-device` (not shown), allowing the
user to configure various actions, (e.g. ON, OFF, sleep, hibernate, pause or play music, answer or hang up a call, skip, f-forward, rewind, repeat, and more), based upon removal or attachment of the digital display 1102 device to and from the headphones
apparatus 1101.
<br/><br/> With this type of design configuration, the headphones apparatus 1101 does not require a physical On/Off button.  Only when a user utilizes the headphones apparatus 1101 would the headphone automatically be turned ON for the user.  The same
holds true for the digital display 1102 device.  Only when the user removes the digital display device 1102 from the headphones apparatus 1101 would power resources be required, and if there exists a time when the user wishes to utilize the digital
display 1102 device without removing it from the headphones apparatus 1101, user preferences are provided to the user on the digital display device 1102 or an electronic device, such as a `smart-connected-device` (not shown), can be configured to provide
different user settings quickly and easily.
<br/><br/> Arrangement shows the headphones apparatus 1101 may be designed to hold more than one type of incorporated strap, bracelet, or band, clip, clasp, necklace, or other type of accessory that can enable the user to select from a variety of accessory
items to wear, arrange, or fashion for easy accessibility to the digital display device 1102 by the user.
