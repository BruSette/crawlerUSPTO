       <p> Particular embodiments determine a modified image for a CAPTCHA. The
     CAPTCHA may include an original image, a challenge based on the original
     image, and/or a correct response based on the original image. The
     modified image may be a scrambled version of the original image.
     Web-browser-executable code is determined for unscrambling the modified
     image back to the original image. The modified image and the
     web-browser-executable code are then provided to a computing device. Upon
     receiving the modified image and the web-browser-executable code, the
     computing device then displays the original image based on the modified
     image and the web-browser-executable code.

<br/><br/> The present disclosure generally relates to scrambling a CAPTCHA image prior to transmitting it to a computing device in order to prevent malicious software from tricking a human user of the computer device into unwittingly providing a correct
CAPTCHA response.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A CAPTCHA, or Captcha, is a type of challenge-response test used to determine whether the response is generated by a non-human entity (e.g., a computer or a piece of software executing on a computer).  The test is based on the assumption that a
human's ability in pattern recognition is much superior than that of a machine's, at least for the present.  In a typical scenario, a CAPTCHA test involves presenting one or more images to a testee (i.e., the person being tested) together with a
challenge (i.e., a question).  The challenge is related to the images presented to the testee and generally requires the testee to recognize some form of pattern in the images.  The testee needs to provide a correct response to the challenge in order to
pass the test.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 1A and 1B illustrate two sample CAPTCHA tests 110 and 120.  In FIG. 1A, CAPTCHA test 110 includes an image 111 of a distorted text string.  Note that texts may be considered a special form of image.  A challenge 112 asks the testee to
recognize the distorted text string and enter it in a response field 113.  In order to pass the test, the testee must enter the correct text string shown in image 111 (i.e., "F8 BpdG").  In FIG. 1B, CAPTCHA test 120 includes an image 121 of an animal.  A
challenge 122 asks the testee to recognize the animal and describe it in a response field 123.  In order to pass the test, the testee must correctly identify the animal shown in image 121 (i.e., a cat).

<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> The present disclosure generally relates to scrambling a CAPTCHA image prior to transmitting it to a computing device in order to prevent malicious software from tricking a human user of the computer device into unwittingly providing a correct
CAPTCHA response.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, at a first computing device, accessing a first image of a CAPTCHA, wherein the CAPTCHA comprises: the first image; a challenge based on the first image; and a correct response based on the first image; constructing a
second image by scrambling the first image, comprising: cutting the first image into a plurality of image sections; recording positions of the image sections in the first image; and randomly rearranging the image sections to construct the second image;
generating web-browser-executable code for unscrambling the second image back to the first image, wherein the web-browser-executable code indicates, for each one of the image sections in the second image, the position of the image section in the first
image; and transmitting the second image and the web-browser-executable code to a second computing device.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, at a second computing device, receiving a second image and web-browser-executable code from a first computing device, wherein: the second image is constructed by randomly rearranging a plurality of image sections of a
first image of a CAPTCHA; the CAPTCHA comprises the first image, a challenge based on the first image; and a correct response based on the first image; and the web-browser-executable code indicates, for each one of the image sections in the second image,
a position of the image section in the first image; and displaying the first image based on the second image and the web-browser-executable code.
<br/><br/> These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The present disclosure is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.  In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough
understanding of the present disclosure.  It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details.  In other instances, well known process steps and/or structures have
not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure.  In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to
limit the disclosure to the described embodiments.  To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.
<br/><br/> CAPTCHAs are used to distinguish a human from a non-human entity, such as computer software or "bots", because a human's ability in pattern recognition is much superior than that of a machine's.  In general, a CAPTCHA test may include an image,
a challenge, and a correct response.  The image and the challenge are presented to a testee, and the testee passes the test by providing the correct response.
<br/><br/> CAPTCHAs are often used to prevent malicious software (malware) from harming computer systems.  In a typical scenario, suppose a computer system allows its human users to perform certain actions (e.g., signing up for user accounts, posting
messages, or establishing social connections with other users).  To ensure that the actions are really performed by the human users, the computer system may issue a CAPTCHA test to an entity when the entity wishes to perform a particular action.  The
entity is required to provide the correct CAPTCHA response in order to proceed further.  The computer system completely performs the action only when the correct response to the CAPTCHA test is provided by the entity.  When the entity is not a human
user, such as a piece of malware, because the malware is unable to automatically determine the correct CAPTCHA response from processing the CAPTCHA image, the malware is unable to provide the correct CAPTCHA response to the computer system.  As a result,
the requested action is not performed, and the malware is prevented from causing harm to the computer system.
<br/><br/> Malware continuously finds new means to get around computer security.  In the case of CAPTCHAs, for example, suppose a piece of malware has infected a client device and is executing on the client device.  The malware attempts to perform an
action on a server with which the client device is connected via a network (e.g., the Internet) without the knowledge or consent of the human user of the client device.  The server issues a CAPTCHA test to the client device, and the image and the
challenge of the CAPTCHA test are included, for example, in a web page so that they may be displayed in a web browser executing on the client device.  Since malware is unable to automatically determine a correct response from processing an image of a
CAPTCHA test, it may find a way to trick a human user into providing the correct response, and then use that response to pass the CAPTCHA test.  For example, suppose a piece of malware wants to perform an action on a computer system or cause a computer
system to perform an action.  As a part of the security measure, the computer system issues a CAPTCHA test.  The malware is unable to determine the correct response on its own.  Thus, it may trick a human user into giving the correct response.  The
malware may use a pop-up window to show the CAPTCHA image to the human user together with a message, asking the human user to provide the correct CAPTCHA response.  To give additional incentive, the malware may, in the message, falsely state that unless
the correct CAPTCHA response is provided, something undesirable may occur to the human user's computer system.  The human user, believing the message to be legitimate, responds to the message by providing the correct CAPTCHA response.  The malware may
then use the correct CAPTCHA response provided by the human user to get around the security measure of the computer system and completes the action.
<br/><br/> To address this issue, particular embodiments may scramble the image of a CAPTCHA test before transmitting it to a computer system.  This way, even if a piece of malware tricks a human user into unwittingly providing a response to the CAPTCHA
test, because the CAPTCHA image has been scrambled and the malware may not be able to unscramble it, the response provided by the human user is given based on the scrambled (assuming the user is able to perceive anything in the scrambled version of the
CAPTCHA image), incorrect CAPTCHA image, not the original, correct CAPTCHA image, and therefore is not the correct response to the CAPTCHA test.  Thus, the malware cannot pass the CAPTCHA test using this incorrect response.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an example method of scrambling an image of a CAPTCHA test.  Although the steps of FIG. 2 are illustrated as being performed on a server and a client, the same steps may be performed on any two computer systems or on the same
computer system.  The steps of FIG. 2 are described using examples illustrated in FIGS. 3A-3C.
<br/><br/> At the server, particular embodiments may cut a first image into a random number of sections (as illustrated in FIG. 2, step 202).  This first image is the original, correct image that is used to construct a CAPTCHA test.  That is, a CAPTCHA
test, which includes the first image, a challenge, and a correct response has been constructed, and the challenge and the correct response of the CAPTCHA test are based on this first image.  The first image may be cut horizontally or vertically or both,
and the individual sections may have the same or different dimensions.  FIG. 3A illustrates an example CAPTCHA image 310.  Let CAPTCHA image 310 be an example of the first image.  CAPTCHA image 310 may be a bit map, a JPEG, or any other suitable image
file format.  In FIG. 3B, CAPTCHA image 310 is cut into six sections 301-306 vertically, again, as an example.  Particular embodiment may assign a unique identifier (e.g., a numerical identifier) to each section.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may construct a second image by randomly rearranging the sections of the first image (as illustrated in FIG. 2, step 204).  The second image may have the same or different number of sections as the first image.  In
particular embodiments, the second image may have the same dimension (i.e., width and height) as the first image.  FIG. 3C illustrates an example image 320 obtained by randomly rearranging the six sections of CAPTCHA image 310.  In this example, the six
sections are arranged as: the sixth section, followed by the first section, followed by the fifth section, followed by the third section, followed by the second section, and followed by the fourth section.  When constructing the second image, particular
embodiments may insert additional image sections not belonging to the first image into the second image, or particular embodiments may repeat some of the image sections of the first image in the second image.  For example, image section 301 may be
included twice or three times in the second image.
<br/><br/> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation semantics (e.g., the look and format) of a document written in a markup language.  CSS is commonly used to style web pages written in Hyper Text Markup
Language (HTML) and Extensible Hyper Text Markup Language (XHTML).  In particular, CSS includes functionalities that support the formatting (e.g., alignment) of images.  Particular embodiments may take advantage of these CSS functionalities and construct
CSS code to unscramble the second image back to the first image correctly when it is display in a web browser (as illustrated in FIG. 2, step 206).
<br/><br/> When the first image is cut into multiple sections, each image section is assigned a unique identifier.  These identifiers may be used to identify the individual image sections in the CSS and HTML code.  When randomly rearranging the image
sections to construct the second image, particular embodiments may record the original positions of the image sections in the first image.  Using FIGS. 3B and 3C as an example, the first section in image 320 is originally the sixth section in image 310
(image section 306); the second section in image 320 is originally the first section in image 310 (image section 301); the third section in image 320 is originally the fifth section in image 310 (image section 305); the fourth section in image 320 is
originally the third section in image 310 (image section 303); the fifth section in image 320 is originally the second section in image 310 (image section 302); and the sixth section in image 320 is originally the fourth section in image 310 (image
section 304).  Thus, to unscramble image 320 back to image 310, the CSS code needs to reverse the process and indicate that when the image is displayed, the first section in image 320 should appear in the position of the sixth section; the second section
in image 320 should appear in the position of the first section; the third section in image 320 should appear in the position of the fifth section; the fourth section in image 320 should appear in the position of the third section; the fifth section in
image 320 should appear in the position of the second section; and the sixth section in image 320 should appear in the position of the fourth section.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may specify the image sections using the "li" tag of HTML.  Assuming image sections 301-306 each have a width of 50 pixels, the following illustrates an example HTML and CSS code for unscrambling the second image (e.g.,
image 320) back to the first image (e.g., image 310).
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 &lt;ul class="ul_scrambled_image"&gt; &lt;li class="li_captcha_scramble" id="captcha_scramble_1"&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="li_captcha_scramble" id="captcha_scramble_2"&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="li_captcha_scramble"
id="captcha_scramble_3"&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="li_captcha_scramble" id="captcha_scramble_4"&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="li_captcha_scramble" id="captcha_scramble_5"&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="li_captcha_scramble"
id="captcha_scramble_6"&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
<br/><br/>HTML Code
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00002 &lt;style&gt; .li_captcha_scramble{ background: url(/captcha_image.jpeg) 0 0 no-repeat; } #captcha_scramble_1{ left: 0px; background-position: -50px 0px; width: 50px; } #captcha_scramble_2{ left: 50px; background-position: -200px
0px; width: 50px; } #captcha_scramble_3{ left: 100px; background-position: -150px 0px; width: 50px; } #captcha_scramble_4{ left: 150px; background-position: -250px 0px; width: 50px; } #captcha_scramble_5{ left: 200px; background-position: -100px 0px;
width: 50px; } #captcha_scramble_6{ left: 250px; background-position: -0px 0px; width: 50px; } &lt;/style&gt;
<br/><br/>CSS Code
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may transmit the CAPTCHA test and the HTML and CSS code to a client (as illustrated in FIG. 2, step 208).  The CAPTCHA test is constructed using the first image.  That is, the challenge and the correct response are
determined based on the first image.  However, only the second, scrambled image is transmitted to the client with the CAPTCHA test.  The first image is not transmitted to the client.
<br/><br/> At the client, upon receiving the CAPTCHA test and the HTML and CSS code as part of a web page or other structured document (as illustrated in FIG. 2, step 210), the CAPTCHA image, together with the challenge, may be displayed in a web browser
based on the HTML and CSS code (as illustrated in FIG. 2, step 212).  The client only receives the second, scrambled image from the server.  However, because the web browser is able to process the HTML and CSS code, the CAPTCHA image is displayed based
on the CSS code and the CSS code indicates how the second image may be unscrambled back to the first image, when the CAPTCHA image is displayed in the web browser, the first, correct image appears.  As a result, a human user sees the first, correct image
and may provide the correct response accordingly.  For CAPTCHA image 310, the correct response is "following finding".
<br/><br/> On the other hand, suppose, at the client, a piece of malware receives the CAPTCHA test with the second, scrambled image.  Because the malware does not have the functionality to unscramble the second image back to the first image using the CSS
code, the malware displays the second image as the CAPTCHA image, hoping to trick a human user into providing the correct CAPTCHA response.  As a result, the human user sees the second, scrambled image and is unable to provide the correct response, which
has been determined using the first, correct image.  For example, when a human user sees image 320, he may not be able to determine what the two words are, or at best may believe the two words to be "ing fefindwimllon", which is of course incorrect.  In
addition, if the image sections are configured to be small enough, the human user may not be able to perceive anything intelligible from the scrambled CAPTCHA image at all.  The malware cannot pass the CAPTCHA test using this incorrect response (if any)
(e.g., sending this incorrect response back to the computer system issuing the CAPTCHA test).
<br/><br/> Alternatively, in particular embodiments, the unscrambling of the CAPTCHA image may be achieved using JavaScript or other types of scripting language that are supported by a web browser.  In this case, the JavaScript code replaces the CSS code
to specify the placements of the image sections so that, when displayed (e.g., in a web browser), the first image appears.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may be implemented in a network environment.  FIG. 4 illustrates an example network environment 400 suitable for providing software validation as a service.  Network environment 400 includes a network 410 coupling one or
