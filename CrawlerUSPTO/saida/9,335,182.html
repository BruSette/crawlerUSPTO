       <p> Vehicle navigation systems and methods for presenting information
     originating from a mobile device on a vehicle navigation system display
     of a vehicle are disclosed. In one embodiment, a method of presenting
     information originating from a mobile device on a vehicle navigation
     system display of a vehicle includes receiving, by a vehicle navigation
     system, application data from an application operating on the mobile
     device, wherein the application data from the application represents an
     entity in proximity to the vehicle. The method further includes
     displaying an icon representing the application data from the application
     on a map presented on the vehicle navigation system display. The icon is
     positioned on the map according to a geographic location of the entity.

<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method of presenting information originating from a mobile device on a vehicle navigation system display of a vehicle, the method comprising: receiving, by a vehicle
navigation system, application data from a plurality of compatible applications operating on the mobile device, wherein: the plurality of compatible applications are a filtered subset of all applications operating on the mobile device, the filtered
subset based on an ability to communicate with the vehicle navigation system;  and the application data from the plurality of compatible applications represents one or more entities in proximity to the vehicle;  and displaying one or more icons
representing the application data from the plurality of compatible applications on a map presented on the vehicle navigation system display, wherein one or more icons are positioned on the map according to a geographic location of the one or more
entities.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, wherein the application data received by the vehicle navigation system is formatted by the vehicle navigation system for display of the one or more icons on the map.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1, further comprising displaying information associated with the application data in response to receiving a user input selecting a selected icon of the one or more icons, wherein the information is representative of an
entity associated with the selected icon.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 3, wherein the application data received by the vehicle navigation system is such that the information is formatted for display on the vehicle navigation system display upon receipt by the vehicle navigation system.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 3, further comprising displaying detailed information associated with the application data in response to receiving a second user input associated with the information, wherein the detailed information is representative
of the entity associated with the selected icon.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to navigation systems, such as vehicle navigation systems, and methods wherein information generated or otherwise provided by an application running on a mobile device, such as a cell phone, is
sent to the navigation system and displayed at a geographic location on a map that is presented on the display of the navigation system.  For example, an application running on the mobile device may be configured to determine entities that are in
proximity to the mobile device, and provide information regarding such entities.  For example, the entities may be nearby points of interest, such as restaurants.  The information provided by the application may include names of the restaurants, physical
addresses of the restaurants, price ranges of the particular dishes served by the restaurants, and the like.  In the embodiments described herein, application data provided by the various applications is communicated from the mobile device to the
navigation system, and icons representing the entities are displayed at the appropriate location on the map according to the physical addresses of the entities.  A user may then select an icon for more detail regarding the entity, and to take further
action, such as request directions to the selected entity.  As described in detail below, embodiments may also provide the ability for the navigation system to detect compatible applications running on the mobile device, and the ability for a user to
select the application data for which applications he or she wishes to be displayed on the display of the navigation system.
<br/><br/> Various embodiments of methods for presenting information originating from a mobile device on a navigation system, as well as navigation system capable of receiving and displaying application data from a mobile device, are described in detail
below.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of a navigation system 100 is schematically depicted.  It is noted that, while the navigation system 100 is depicted in isolation, the navigation system 100 may be coupled to a vehicle (not depicted in the
figures).  The vehicle may be an automobile or any other passenger or non-passenger vehicle such as, for example, a terrestrial, aquatic, and/or airborne vehicle.  Although the navigation system is referred to herein as a vehicle navigation system, it
should be understood that in some embodiments the navigation system may not be associated with a vehicle, such as hand-held global positioning system (GPS) units.
<br/><br/> The vehicle navigation system 100 may include one or more processors 102.  Each of the one or more processors 102 can be any device capable of executing machine readable instructions.  Accordingly, each of the one or more processors 102 may be a
controller, an integrated circuit, a microchip, a computer, or any other computing device.  The one or more processors 102 can be coupled to a communication path 104 that provides signal interconnectivity between various modules of the vehicle navigation
system 100.  Accordingly, the communication path 104 can communicatively couple any number of processors with one another, and allow the modules of the vehicle navigation system 100 coupled to the communication path 104 to operate in a distributed
computing environment.  Specifically, each of the modules can operate as a node that may send and/or receive data.  As used herein, the term "communicatively coupled" means that coupled components are capable of exchanging data signals with one another
such as, for example, electrical signals via conductive medium, over-the-air electromagnetic signals, optical signals via optical waveguides, and the like.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, the communication path 104 can be formed from any medium that is capable of transmitting a signal such as, for example, conductive wires, conductive traces, optical waveguides, or the like.  Moreover, the communication path 104 can
be formed from a combination of mediums capable of transmitting signals.  In one embodiment, the communication path 104 can comprise a combination of conductive traces, conductive wires, connectors, and buses that cooperate to permit the transmission of
electrical data signals to components such as processors, memories, sensors, input devices, output devices, and communication devices.  Accordingly, the communication path 104 can comprise a vehicle bus, such as for example a LIN bus, a CAN bus, a VAN
bus, and the like.  Additionally, it is noted that the term "signal" means a waveform (e.g., electrical, optical, magnetic, mechanical or electromagnetic), such as DC, AC, sinusoidal-wave, triangular-wave, square-wave, vibration, and the like, capable of
traveling through a medium.
<br/><br/> The vehicle navigation system 100 may include one or more memory modules 106 coupled to the communication path 104.  The one or more memory modules 106 may be configured as RAM, ROM, flash memories, hard drives, and/or any device capable of
storing machine readable instructions such that the machine readable instructions can be accessed by the one or more processors 102.  The machine readable instructions can comprise logic or algorithm(s) written in any programming language of any
generation (e.g., 1GL, 2GL, 3GL, 4GL, or 5GL) such as, for example, machine language that may be directly executed by the processor, or assembly language, object-oriented programming (OOP), scripting languages, microcode, etc., that may be compiled or
assembled into machine readable instructions and stored on the one or more memory modules 106.  Alternatively, the machine readable instructions may be written in a hardware description language (HDL), such as logic implemented via either a
field-programmable gate array (FPGA) configuration or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or their equivalents.  Accordingly, the methods described herein may be implemented in any conventional computer programming language, as
pre-programmed hardware elements, or as a combination of hardware and software components.
<br/><br/> Still referring to FIG. 1, the vehicle navigation system 100 comprises a display 108 for providing visual output such as, for example, maps, navigation, entertainment, information, or combinations thereof.  The display 108 can be coupled to the
communication path 104.  Accordingly, the communication path 104 can communicatively couple the display 108 to other modules of the vehicle navigation system 100.  The display 108 can include any medium capable of transmitting an optical output such as,
for example, a cathode ray tube, light emitting diodes, a liquid crystal display, a plasma display, or the like.  Moreover, the display 108 can be a touch screen that, in addition to providing optical information, detects the presence and location of a
tactile input upon a surface of or adjacent to the display.  Accordingly, each display can receive mechanical input directly upon the optical output provided by the display.  Additionally, it is noted that the display 108 can include at least one of the
one or more processors 102 and the one or more memory modules 106.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the vehicle navigation system 100 may also comprise tactile input hardware 110 coupled to the communication path 104 such that the communication path 104 communicatively couples the tactile input hardware 110 to other
modules of the vehicle navigation system 100.  The tactile input hardware 110 can be any device capable of transforming mechanical, optical, or electrical signals into a data signal capable of being transmitted with the communication path 104. 
Specifically, the tactile input hardware 110 can include any number of movable objects that each transform physical motion into a data signal that can be transmitted over the communication path 104 such as, for example, a button, a switch, a knob, a
microphone or the like.  In some embodiments, the display 108 and the tactile input hardware 110 can be combined as a single module and operate as an audio head unit or an infotainment system of a vehicle.  However, it is noted, that the display 108 and
the tactile input hardware 110 can be separate from one another and operate as a single module by exchanging signals via the communication path 104.
<br/><br/> The vehicle navigation system 100 may also include a peripheral tactile input 112 coupled to the communication path 104 such that the communication path 104 communicatively couples the peripheral tactile input 112 to other modules of the vehicle
navigation system 100.  For example, in one embodiment, the peripheral tactile input 112 can be located in a vehicle console to provide additional location for receiving input.  The peripheral tactile input 112 operates in a manner substantially similar
to the tactile input hardware 110, i.e., the peripheral tactile input 112 includes movable objects and transforms motion of the movable objects into a data signal that can be transmitted over the communication path 104.  For example, the peripheral
tactile input 112 may be configured as a moveable joystick or knob.
<br/><br/> The vehicle navigation system 100 further comprises a satellite module 114 coupled to the communication path 104 such that the communication path 104 communicatively couples the satellite module 114 to other modules of the vehicle navigation
system 100.  The satellite module 114 is configured to receive signals from global positioning system satellites.  Specifically, in one embodiment, the satellite module 114 can include one or more conductive elements acting as an antenna that interact
with electromagnetic signals transmitted by global positioning system satellites.  The received signal can be transformed into a data signal indicative of the location (e.g., latitude and longitude) of the satellite module 114 or an object positioned
near the satellite module 114, by the one or more processors 102.  The received signal can be transformed that corresponds to the location (e.g., latitude and longitude) of the satellite module 114.  Additionally, it is noted that the satellite module
114 can include at least one of the one or more processors 102 and the one or more memory modules 106.
<br/><br/> In embodiments where the vehicle navigation system 100 is coupled to a vehicle, the one or more processors 102 can execute machine readable instructions to transform the signals received by the satellite module 114 into data indicative of the
positioning of the vehicle with respect to road data, i.e., the vehicle position can be indicated on a map.  The road data can be stored as machine readable instructions in the one or more memory modules 106.  Alternatively or additionally, road data can
be stored on a removable data module 116.  Specifically, the removable data module 116 can be coupled to the communication path 104 via a socket with a movable member.  The movable member can transition between states that apply varying amounts of force
to the removable data module 116.  Accordingly, the removable data module 116 can be optical media, solid state flash memory (e.g., USB or memory card), or a combination thereof.
<br/><br/> The vehicle navigation system 100 can comprise network interface hardware 118 for communicatively coupling the vehicle navigation system 100 with a mobile device 120 or a computer network.  The network interface hardware 118 can be coupled to
the communication path 104 such that the communication path 104 communicatively couples the network interface hardware 118 to other modules of the vehicle navigation system 100.  The network interface hardware 118 can be any device capable of
transmitting and/or receiving data via a wireless network.  Accordingly, the network interface hardware 118 can include a communication transceiver for sending and/or receiving data according to any wireless communication standard.  For example, the
network interface hardware 118 may include a chipset (e.g., antenna, processors, machine readable instructions, etc.) to communicate over wireless computer networks such as, for example, wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), WiMax, Bluetooth, IrDA, Wireless USB,
Z-Wave, ZigBee, or the like.
<br/><br/> As is noted above, the vehicle navigation system 100 can be communicatively coupled to a mobile device 120 via the network interface hardware 118.  As described in more detail below, application data from various applications running on the
mobile device may be provided from the mobile device 120 to the vehicle navigation system 100 via the network interface hardware.  The mobile device 120 can be any device having hardware (e.g., chipsets, processors, memory, etc.) for communicatively
coupling with the network interface hardware 118 and a cellular network 122.  Specifically, the mobile device 120 can include an antenna for communicating over one or more of the wireless computer networks described above.  Moreover, the mobile device
120 can include a mobile antenna for communicating with the cellular network 122.  Accordingly, the mobile antenna can be configured to send and receive data according to a mobile telecommunication standard of any generation (e.g., 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G,
etc.).  Specific examples of a mobile device 120 include, but are not limited to, smart phones, tablet devices, e-readers, laptop computers, or the like.
<br/><br/> The cellular network 122 generally includes a plurality of base stations that are configured to receive and transmit data according to mobile telecommunication standards.  The base stations are further configured to receive and transmit data
over wired systems such as public switched telephone network (PSTN) and backhaul networks.  The cellular network 122 can further include any network accessible via the backhaul networks such as, for example, wide area networks, metropolitan area
networks, the Internet, satellite networks, or the like.  Thus, the base stations generally include one or more antennas, transceivers, and processors that execute machine readable instructions to exchange data over various wired and/or wireless
networks.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, the cellular network 122 can be utilized as a wireless access point by the mobile device 120 to access one or more servers (e.g., a first server 124 and/or a second server 126).  The first server 124 and second server 126 generally
include processors, memory, and chipset for delivering resources via the cellular network 122.  Resources can include providing, for example, processing, storage, software, and information from the first server 124 and/or the second server 126 via the
cellular network 122.  Additionally, it is noted that the first server 124 or the second server 126 can share resources with one another over the cellular network 122 such as, for example, via the wired portion of the network, the wireless portion of the
network, or combinations thereof.
<br/><br/> The one or more servers may include third party servers that are associated with the applications that are running on the mobile device 120.  For example, application data associated with a first application running on the mobile device (e.g.,
OpenTable) may be stored on the first server 124 that is operated by an organization that provides the first application, and application data associated with a second application running on the mobile device (e.g., Yelp!) may be stored on the second
server 126 that is operated by an organization that provides the second application.  It should be understood that the mobile device 120 may be communicatively coupled to any number of servers by way of the cellular network 122.
<br/><br/> As described in more detail below, one or more of the servers may be associated with an organization that manufactures or otherwise maintains the vehicle navigation system 100 (i.e., an intermediary server).  For example, the intermediary server
may interface with the servers associated with the organizations that provide the applications, as described above.  Application data from the various applications may first be provided to the intermediary server (e.g., for formatting or compliance
verification) over one or more networks of the cellular network 122, and then provided to the mobile device 120.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary map 130 presented by the display 108 of the vehicle navigation system 100 is schematically illustrated.  The map 130 may display various roads associated with the geographic location within the proximity of
the vehicle navigation system 100.  The size of the area displayed on the map 130 (i.e., the scale) may be user-selectable.  The geographic information displayed by the map 130 is based at least in part on information provided by the satellite module
114.
<br/><br/> The exemplary map 130 includes a first road 132a that intersects with a second road 132b.  The satellite module 114 provides a geographic location of the vehicle navigation system 100 and associated vehicle, which is then displayed on the map
130 by an icon 133.  It should be understood that embodiments described and illustrated herein are not limited to any icon format or style, and that any type of icon may be used to depict the various information described herein.  The user may have
selected a destination via any one of the aforementioned input devices 108, 110, 112 such that that a route 134 is highlighted on the map 130 in embodiments that are configured to provide directions to a user-selected destination.
<br/><br/> The exemplary map 130 further includes a user interface that is defined by various soft-keys positioned within the display 108.  The soft-keys may be actuated via a touch screen on the display 108, and/or by the tactile input hardware 110 and/or
the peripheral tactile input 112.  The soft-keys may provide for the selection of any number of options or information.  In the illustrated embodiment, the soft-keys on the present screen of the user interface provided on the display 108 are configured
as a zoom-out button 143 that allows the user to zoom out and increase the geographical range that is displayed on the map 130, a Destination button 144 that generates a user interface that allows the user to select one or more destinations, a Map
Options button 145 that allows the user to change various parameters of the map 130 (as described in more detail below), and a zoom-in button 146 that allows the user to zoom in and decrease the geographical range that is displayed on the map 130.
<br/><br/> Also provided in the user interface of the exemplary map 130 are additional informational regions and buttons.  Informational region 140 displays a direction that the vehicle is currently traveling as detected by the satellite module 114,
informational region 141 displays information relating to the scale of the map 130 and the source of the geographic information, and button 142 may be selected by the user to toggle traffic information on and off within the display 108.
<br/><br/> As described above, the vehicle navigation system 100 is configured to communicate with the mobile device 120 to receive application data from various applications that are stored or are otherwise running on the mobile device 120.  Generally,
the application data may be indicative of one or more entities and the geographic location of those one or more entities.  Vehicle navigation systems 100 described herein receive the application data from the mobile device 120, determine the geographic
location of one or more entities, and position an icon for each entity on the map 130 at a position that corresponds with the geographic location.
<br/><br/> In the example depicted in FIG. 2, three applications running on the mobile device have provided application data to the vehicle navigation system, wherein the application data of each application corresponds to one entity.  A first application
has provided application data corresponding to a first entity that is represented by a first icon 150a, a second application has provided application data corresponding to a second entity that is represented by a second icon 150b, and a third application
has provided application data corresponding to a third entity that is represented by a third icon 150c.  As an example and not a limitation, the first application may be Yelp!, and the first icon 150a may represent a pharmacy that is in close proximity
to the vehicle.  The second application may be OpenTable, and the second icon 150b may represent a close-by restaurant, and the third application may be Gas Buddy, and the third icon 150c may represent a close-by gas station.
<br/><br/> The icons 150a-150c are presented in the map 130 according to their geographic location that is provided in the associated application data.  For example, the application data for each entity may include the physical address and/or GPS
coordinates of the entity so that the vehicle navigation system 100 may present the icons representing entities at the proper location on the map 130.
<br/><br/> Although each application is only providing application data for a single entity in FIG. 2, it should be understood that each application may send application data that represents many individual entities.  As an example and not a limitation,
the Gas Buddy application may send application data that corresponds to any number close-by gas stations, and OpenTable may send application data that corresponds to any number of close-by restaurants.
<br/><br/> It should be understood that the icons 150a-150c depicted in FIG. 2 (and FIGS. 3 and 4) are generic.  The icons may take on any size, shape, or color.  In some embodiments, the icon configuration may represent the icon that is associated with
the particular application.
<br/><br/> The application data may be formatted either by the third party that is associated with the application, an application programming interface (API) on the mobile device 120, or the navigation system 100 such that it is properly displayed on the
display 108.  For example, the icon size should be such that the location of the associated entity may be properly discerned by the user.  If the icon is too large, it may take up too much space on the display 108 and it may be difficult for the user to
determine the actual location of the entity represented by the icon.  The size of the icon may also depend on the size and/or resolution of the display 108.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, an API runs on the mobile device 120 and provides the formatted application data received from the various applications to the vehicle navigation system 100.  Thus, the API is in communication with the various applications
running on the mobile device 120.  In other embodiments, the third party application providers may provide the application data in a proper format for display on the vehicle navigation system 100 directly to the applications running on the mobile device
120.  The vehicle navigation system 100 may then receive this formatted application data directly from the applications.  For example, the user may register his or her applications with the various third party application providers so that the third
party application providers then send the application data to the mobile device in a proper format for display on the display 108 of the vehicle navigation system 100.  In still other embodiments, the vehicle navigation system 100 may receive the
application data directed from the applications on the mobile device 120, and then format the data for display on the display 108 of the vehicle navigation system 100.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 3, in one embodiment the user may select an icon 150a-150c that is displayed on the map to receive more information regarding the entity that was provided by the application associated with the icon 150a-150c.  In the
illustrated embodiment, the user has selected, by a user input, the second icon 150b associated with the second application running on the mobile device 120 by any one of the above-described input devices.  Shape 151 represents a user selection of the
second icon 150b (e.g., by touching a touch screen-enabled display 108 surface).  Returning to the above-described nonlimiting example, the second icon 150b may represent a restaurant as determined by OpenTable.  Selection of the OpenTable icon 150b
causes the vehicle navigation system 100 to display information regarding the restaurant associated with the OpenTable icon 150b.  In the illustrated example, the name of the restaurant is displayed in an informational bar 161 of an entity information
display 160 at the top of the display 108.  It should be understood that embodiments are not limited to location and format of the display of the information associated with the entity.
<br/><br/> The entity information display 160 may further include a more information button 162 that causes the display 108 to provide additional information regarding the entity corresponding to the application data associated with the entity, which is
described below with respect to FIG. 4.  Selection of an icon 150a-150c may also cause the display of additional soft-key buttons, such as the Mark button 149, which marks the entity associate with the icon 150a-150c for future information retrieval.
<br/><br/> Embodiments may also provide for the display of additional, more detailed information regarding the entity of the selected icon.  As an example, user selection of the more information button 162 (or similar button) may cause the additional
detailed information regarding the entity to be display on the display 108 of the vehicle navigation system 100.  An example of the displayed of the additional detailed information regarding the restaurant associated with OpenTable icon 150b is
schematically depicted in FIG. 4.  The additional, detailed information 164 of the illustrated embodiment is provided in a detailed information window 163 positioned on the map 130.  It should be understood that the additional, detailed information 164
may be displayed in other formats and configurations, such as on a dedicated screen, a different location on the map 130, etc.
<br/><br/> The detailed information 164 may include, but is not limited to, the name of the entity (in the present example, "Ma and Pa's Italian Eatery and Shop"), the physical address of the entity, and a telephone number associated with the entity. 
Additional information may also be provided, such as a website address, an e-mail address, an average rating (e.g., 4/5 stars), and any other information that may be useful regarding the particular entity.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the display 108 may present a call button 165 that a user may select to call the particular entity.  In other embodiments, the user may call the entity by selecting the telephone number, if the telephone number comprises
active text that causes the phone functionality of the mobile device 120 to call the phone number provided in the active text.
<br/><br/> The screen depicted in FIG. 4 further includes a button (e.g., Go button 166) that sets the physical address of the entity associated with the selected icon as a destination within the vehicle navigation system 100.  The vehicle navigation
system 100 may then provide direction to the entity.  The display 108 may also present a Back button 167 to return the user to the previous screen (e.g., the screen represented in FIG. 3).
<br/><br/> The Map Options button 145 (see FIGS. 2 and 3) causes the vehicle navigation system 100 to display a map options user interface 170 wherein the user may set various parameters associated with the vehicle navigation system 100.  The exemplary map
options user interface 170 depicts a plurality of generic Options buttons 172a-172h that are associated with a plurality of parameters.  For example, one or more of the Options buttons 172a-172g may dictate how the map 130 is presented, such as by a
map-only display without additional information, a dual map that may provide two maps on the display 108, the display of a turn list, and the like.  The Options buttons 172a-172g may also allow a user to select points of interest, set a speed limit, set
traffic reporting options, etc.
<br/><br/> Option button 172h provides options relating to the display of the application data provided by the mobile device 120.  Selection of Option button 172h may cause the vehicle navigation system 100 to display an application icon options screen 180
on the display 108.  FIG. 6 depicts an exemplary application icon options screen 180 according to one embodiment.  Generally, the application icon options screen 180 depicted in FIG. 6 allows a user to select which applications he or she wishes to
provide icons and information to the display 108, and which applications he or she wishes to filter out.  The application icon options screen 180 comprises a list of applications 182 that lists compatible application names 183a-183f of applications that
are compatible with the vehicle navigation system 100.  Each compatible application name 183a-183f has a check box or other selection feature that allows the user to select or deselect the particular compatible application.  The list of applications 182
may further include a scrollbar 186 if the number of compatible applications is greater than what may be presented on the display 108.  User may scroll the bar 188 to navigate the list of applications 182, or use an up arrow 187a or the down arrow 187b. 
The list of applications 182 may also be navigated by gestures, such as flicking the list using his or her finger on a touch screen of the display 108.
<br/><br/> In the illustrated example, the user has selected <b><i>Facebook</i></b> 183a, Weather 183b, Yelp! 183c, OpenTable 183d, and National Geographic--National Parks 183f applications, and deselected the Twitter 183e application.  Accordingly, the vehicle
navigation system 100 may display application data associated with only those applications that are selected by the user.  It is noted that some applications may not have geographic location information associated with a physical address or location,
such as the Weather and Twitter applications.  The icons and/or application data associated with these applications, or other applications where the application data does not include a physical address or location, may be presented at one or more regions
of the display 108 (e.g., one or more corners of the display 108).
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 7, a flow chart 200 of how applications running on the mobile device 120 are detected and filtered for display on the vehicle navigation system 100 according to one embodiment is depicted.  At block 201, the vehicle
navigation system 100 may receive stored applications data from the mobile device 120.  The stored application data represents the names of the compatible applications that are running on the mobile device 120.  In one embodiment, the stored applications
data is stored in a file on the mobile device 120.  In another embodiment, the stored applications data is stored on a remote server that is accessed by the mobile device 120 and/or the vehicle navigation system 100.  The stored applications data may be
periodically updated as the user adds and removes applications from his or her mobile device 120.
<br/><br/> Once the vehicle navigation system 100 is aware of which compatible applications are running on the mobile device 120, the vehicle navigation system 100 may display the list of applications at block 202.  For example, the list of applications
may be configured as the list of applications 182 depicted in FIG. 6 wherein the user may select or deselect various compatible applications.  At block 203, the vehicle navigation system 100 receives application selection input that corresponds with the
applications that the user desires to have information displayed on the vehicle navigation system 100.  At block 204, the vehicle navigation system 100 receives formatted application data that is in a format that is compatible with the display 108
vehicle navigation system 100.  As stated above, in some embodiments an API running on the mobile device 120 may format that application data, or the applications may format the application data directed (e.g., the third party servers of the various
applications may provide the formatted application data).  However, in other embodiments, the vehicle navigation system may format the application data for presentation on the display 108.
<br/><br/> At block 205, the vehicle navigation system 100 displays the icons corresponding to the application data of the various selected applications as the vehicle travels.  As the vehicle travels down the road, the icons will change, as only those
icons representing entities in close proximity to the vehicle may be displayed.
<br/><br/> It should now be understood that embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to vehicle navigation systems and methods wherein applications running on a mobile device provide application data to the vehicle navigation system.  More
specifically, icons representing entities associated to the application data are displayed at locations on a map corresponding to a physical address or location of the entities.  As an example and not a limitation, an application running on a mobile
device that is communicatively coupled to the navigation system may be programmed to provide information regarding restaurants (other other businesses, organizations, etc.) that are in proximity to a present location.  Application data regarding the
restaurants may be provided by the application to the vehicle navigation system such that icons are displayed on the map of the vehicle navigation system at the proper locations that correspond to the physical addresses of the nearby restaurants.  In
this manner, icons associated with entities provided by applications running on a mobile device may be populated onto a map of a vehicle navigation system.
<br/><br/> While particular embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it should be understood that various other changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter.  Moreover,
although various aspects of the claimed subject matter have been described herein, such aspects need not be utilized in combination.  It is therefore intended that the appended claims cover all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of
the claimed subject matter.
