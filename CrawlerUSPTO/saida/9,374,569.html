<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> 1.  Technical Field
<br/><br/> The embodiments herein generally relate to an interface for a storage media, and, more particularly, to a storage medium with an in-built menu based interactivity and navigation that includes retrieval of relevant multimedia content based on
keywords pre-linked with multimedia content.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of the Related Art
<br/><br/> DVDs have traditionally been built upon the idea of delivering the movie hall film to the viewer's home TV set.  The entire purpose and logic behind the structure of a DVD was motivated by and guided by this concern primarily.  In that sense,
the traditional DVD with its simple menu with an option to choose a language, a subtitle language, and sound scheme (e.g., stereo or 5.1 surround sound) was sufficient and provided excellent support for the film industry
<br/><br/> In the meantime, the world has changed rapidly with the internet, Rich internet applications, cheap and powerful computers and myriad multimedia formats and possibilities.  The ubiquitous DVD has however been restricted to its original standard
specification.  So while DVDs today can, and do provide different types of content, its interactive possibilities have not yet been utilized in the manner in which a multimedia application or the internet has been.
<br/><br/> DVD-Video contents are organized as contiguous addressable chunks of data, known as program streams.  In order to play back the contents recorded on a DVD disc, the DVD player firmware includes two major components, namely a presentation engine
and a navigation engine.  The presentation engine uses information in the presentation data stream from the disc to know how to display its contents.  For navigation, the DVD player uses the information in the navigation data stream from the disc to
provide interactivity for the user interface, display menus, etc. via a standard set of player instructions.
<br/><br/> The structure of any typical DVD structure comprises of: a) Cell b) Program c) Chapter d) Program chain (PGC) e) VOB f) Video title set.  FIG. 1 illustrates a user interface view 100 of the program chain within a typical DVD.  The program chain
102 includes a plurality of programs such as a program 104, a program 106 and a program 108.  The programs include a plurality of cells.
<br/><br/> The program 104 includes a cell 1 110, a cell 2 112 and a cell 3 114.  The program 106 includes a cell 1 116, a cell 2 118 and a cell 3 120.  The program 108 includes a cell 1 122, a cell 2 124 and a cell 3 126.  The program chain usually
consists of information and commands on how to play back a list of cells.
<br/><br/> Storage media like DVDs inherently lack interactive functionality which is provided to them by playing them in computers.  The storage media like DVD when played on DVD players provides limited interactivity with the multimedia content fed in
them.  Certain DVDs enable user to restrict selected multimedia contents from access by other users, some DVDs allow user to select pre-defined multimedia content to be played.  No DVD currently provides a full fledged navigation menu based interactive
functionality when played on a DVD player.  The navigation data stream of the DVD provides interactivity for the user interface, display menus, and to support random access and conditional branching, etc, via a standard set of player instructions known
as DVD virtual commands.  However, these DVD virtual commands are limited to certain basic functionalities.  FIG. 2 illustrates a table view of limited virtual commands in a typical DVD.  FIG. 3 illustrates a table view of virtual commands that are
available in a Video Title Set Menu (VTSM) domain.
<br/><br/> Further, when a DVD stores a large amount of multimedia content, retrieval of relevant content is a huge challenge, since the DVD does not support search functionalities or advanced navigation functionalities.  For example, in the case of a DVD
that stores hundreds or thousands of videos, one has to manually select and play each video to find the video that is of relevance if one is unaware of its contents.  Therefore there remains a need for developing interface for a storage media enhancing
interactivity of a user with information retrieval of the multimedia content especially when the storage media like DVD is played on a DVD player.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> In view of the foregoing, an embodiment herein provides a non-transitory storage medium readable by a non-versatile interpretation device and executable on a player device.  The non-transitory storage medium includes instructions executable even
on the non-versatile interpretation device to enable a method of enhanced search and retrieval of one or more relevant media entities from a comprehensive dataset of media entities stored on the non-transitory storage medium.  The non-versatile
interpretation device includes a navigation engine built on a limited set of virtual commands embedded on to a chipset to provide interaction with the media entities.  The non-transitory storage medium stores a plurality of keywords that are in-built. 
Each of the keywords are pre-linked to at least one of the media entities on the non-transitory storage medium.  The player device includes a processor, a selection means, and a display.  The method includes displaying, by the display means, the
plurality of keywords already stored on the non-transitory storage medium, processing, by the selection means, a first input includes a mere selection of a keyword from the plurality of keywords, displaying, by the display means, a subset of the
comprehensive dataset of media entities, the subset consists of specific media entities pre-linked to the keyword on the non-transitory storage medium, processing, by the selection means, a second input that includes a selection ofa media entity, and
playing the media entity.
<br/><br/> The plurality of keywords already stored on the non-transitory storage medium is displayed in response to a selection of a keywords interactive entity from a first level menu that includes the keywords menu interactive entity, a graded submenu
interactive entity, a favourites menu interactive entity, and/or a key media entities menu interactive entity.  A first level submenu interactive entity and a second level submenu interactive entity are displayed in response to a selection of the graded
