</font><br/>
       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A method, a system and a computer program product for influencing ranking
     of URLs in a search engine. In an example embodiment, a computer
     determines that a posting of a URL has occurred in a social networking
     environment, the computer tracks accesses of the URL subsequent to the
     posting of the URL. The computer further determines whether a number of
     accesses of the URL has increased subsequent to the posting of the URL
     and, responsive to determining that the number of accesses of the URL has
     increased subsequent to the posting of the URL, the computer determines
     whether the number of accesses of the URL has increased by at least a
     predefined threshold. Further, responsive to determining that the number
     of accesses of the URL has increased by at least the predefined
     threshold, the computer increases the ranking of the URL in a search
     engine.

<br/><br/> 1.  Technical Field
<br/><br/> Present invention embodiments relate to the ranking of search results for network content by a search engine, in particular ranking of URL results for a search of the internet.
<br/><br/> 2.  Discussion of Related Art
<br/><br/> Search engines can utilize a number of different strategies and algorithms for prioritizing or ranking content associated with a search query.  In particular, search engines which search the internet or other types of networks prioritize or rank
links to uniform resource locators (URLs) based upon content associated with such URLs that is deemed relevant to a search query input by a user.
<br/><br/> Social networks have become increasingly popular over the years.  Many features of social media have developed, such as social groups or communities that allow members of a social network to follow other members and view content of interest or
deemed relevance to the member being followed.  For example, in the Twitter social network, followers can retweet (RT) content to their followers, and their followers RT the content to further followers, and so on.  Content that can be retweeted in
Twitter (or posted from one member to other members in other forms of social media) includes the posting of URLs.
<br/><br/> Certain types of content can gain popularity rapidly at social network cites (e.g., trending topics).  For example, in a Twitter environment, the number of RTs that may occur for a particular URL can increase in a rapid manner in a relatively
short period of time, in particular depending upon the status of the originator of a tweet including the URL and the number of followers of the originator.  Thus, the relevance of a URL can quickly increase within a social network environment.  However,
current search engines do not take into consideration the influence of posts (e.g., tweets or RTs) on access to content in ranking the relevance of URLs associated with such content.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the present invention include a method, a system and a computer program product for influencing ranking of URLs in a search engine.  A determination is made that a posting of a URL has occurred in a social networking environment,
and accesses of the URL are tracked subsequent to the posting of the URL.  Another determination is made whether a number of accesses of the URL has increased subsequent to the posting of the URL and, responsive to determining that the number of accesses
of the URL has increased subsequent to the posting of the URL, a further determination is made whether the number of accesses of the URL has increased by at least a predefined threshold.  Further, responsive to determining that the number of accesses of
the URL has increased by at least the predefined threshold, the ranking of the URL is increased in a search engine. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Present invention embodiments pertain to systems and corresponding techniques and computer program products that influence the prioritization or ranking of links to uniform resource locators (URLs) in a search engine based upon monitored
postings that are associated with such URLs that occur at a social network.  A URL provides a reference to a website or web page location available over a network such as the internet.  A URL can be typed within a web browser application to allow a user
to navigate to a particular website associated with the URL.  A URL can also be provided as an HTML link within a document or other text content that allows a user to navigate to the website by activating (e.g., clicking on) the HTML link.
<br/><br/> In accordance with the present invention embodiments, tracking of the posts of one or more URLs within a social networking environment are correlated with metrics that track the number of users accessing such URLs to assess whether accesses of a
particular URL have changed significantly subsequent to the posting of the URL within the social network environment.  In the event the number of accesses has increased at a URL subsequent to a post of the URL within a social networking environment, the
ranking of the URL can be increased by the search engine.
<br/><br/> An example computing system that monitors postings of URLs in a social networking environment is depicted in FIG. 1.  A social networking environment refers to a computing network that supports social networking activities between members or
participants of the environment, where the participants connect with computing devices to one or more social network host servers and communicate in social networking activities with each other via email, instant messaging, web conferencing, group
chatting, posting of messages or any other forms of content, blogging and any other types of exchange of digital data comprising communications between users.  Example embodiments of social networking environments include, without limitation, Twitter,
<b><i>Facebook,</i></b> MySpace, LinkedIn, Google+, etc.
<br/><br/> System 2 includes a plurality of computing devices 6 connected, via a network 4, to other computing devices.  For example, the computing devices 6 can connect to communicate with each other within a social networking environment via one or more
social network servers 8.  Computing devices 6 can further connect, via the network 4, to one or more search engines 10.  It is noted that the number of computing devices 6, social network servers 8 and search engines 10 depicted in FIG. 1 is for example
purposes only, and the system can include any suitable number of each (e.g., several thousand or more computing devices 6 connecting with multiple social network servers 8 and having access to multiple search engines 10).
<br/><br/> The network 4 can be implemented by any number of any suitable communications media (e.g., wide area network (WAN), local area network (LAN), Internet, Intranet, etc.).  Each of the computing devices 6, social network servers 8 and search
engines 10 can be implemented by any conventional or other computer systems optionally equipped with a display or monitor, a base, where the base includes at least one processor, memory and/or an internal or external network interface or communications
device (e.g., modem, network cards, etc.) that facilitates connection with other computing devices over the network 4, optional input devices (e.g., a keyboard, mouse, or other input device), and any commercially available and custom software (e.g.,
internet browser software, communications software, server software, search engine and/or web crawling software, etc.).  The computing devices may include server, desktop, laptop, and hand-held computing devices (e.g., smart phones, PDAs, notebooks,
tablets, etc.).
<br/><br/> An example embodiment of a computing device is depicted in FIG. 2.  The computing device 6 includes a processor 12, input and output devices 13 (e.g., keyboard, mouse, camera, microphone, display, etc.), a network interface unit 14 (e.g., modem,
network card, etc.) that facilitates communication with other computing devices over the network 4, and a memory 15.  The memory 15 can be RAM and/or ROM memory configured as one or more hardware units of the computing device.  The memory 15 includes a
control process logic software module 16 including operating system code for the processor 12 as well as any other commercially available and custom software to facilitate operations of the computing device 6 utilizing the processor 12.  The memory 15
further includes a web browser application module 18 including one or more web browser applications (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, etc.) that facilitate internet web browsing over the internet.
<br/><br/> In addition, the memory 15 can optionally include a social network application module 20 that includes any applications that may be necessary to engage and operate within a social network environment (e.g., for logging on or connecting with one
or more social network servers 8 to facilitate interaction of the participant/user of the computing device 6 with participants/users of other computing devices also connected via the social network server(s) 8).  In an example embodiment, a social
networking environment (e.g., Twitter) allows a user to log on or connect within the social networking environment by simply using a web browsing application (e.g., from module 18) that allows the user to connect with an internet website hosted by one or
more social network servers 8, where the user of the computing device 6 interacts and communicates with other users operating their computing devices via interactions at the internet website hosted by the network server(s) 8.  In other embodiments, one
or more social network applications (e.g., stored within module 20) may be required to connect with one or more servers 8 in order to engage and interact within the social networking environment.
<br/><br/> Each social network server 8 can be configured as any suitable network server computing device, with one or more processors, memory including control process logic for operation of the server and any suitable number of social network
applications that facilitate hosting of social networking operations by the server 8 for users/participants within the social networking environment.
<br/><br/> An example embodiment of a search engine 10 is depicted in FIG. 3.  The search engine 10 can be any suitable computing device including a processor 21, a network interface unit 23 (e.g., modem, network card, etc.) that facilitates communication
with other computing devices over the network 4, and a memory 22.  The memory 22 can also be RAM and/or ROM memory configured as one or more hardware units of the computing device.  The memory 22 includes a control process logic software module 24
including operating system code for the processor 21 as well as any other commercially available and custom software to facilitate operations of the search engine 10 utilizing the processor 21.
<br/><br/> The memory 22 also includes a search query processing and web crawling application module 25 comprising one or more suitable applications that facilitate receipt and processing of a search query by a user of a computing device that accesses the
search engine (e.g., via a website associated with the search engine) and conducting a search of the internet (or any defined network) for URLs containing content that is deemed relevant to the search query.  The one or more applications of the module 25
further provide a ranking of search results based upon relevance of the content associated with each URL in relation to the search query.  For example, the ranking of search results can be provided as a listing of URLs (e.g., as HTML links) at a search
result website (e.g., one or more web pages of the website) that are provided in response to a user's search query.  The general search engine functions for web crawling based upon a search query to find search results and providing a ranking of such
search results based upon relevancy in the form of a prioritized listing of URLs is known (e.g., searching provided by known search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, AltaVista, Bing, etc.).
<br/><br/> The memory 22 of the search engine 10 further includes a URL/web page data module 26 comprising one or more applications that track metrics associated with URLs, including metrics regarding the number of accesses by users occurring at a website
associated with a URL over any given time period.  For example, the search engine 10, via the module 26, can track the number of times or a frequency of visits to a website associated with a particular URL by users over an hourly period, a daily period,
a weekly or monthly period, etc. The memory 22 includes a social network monitoring module 28 comprising one or more applications that monitor when certain types of content, including URL content, is posted at a website associated with a particular
social networking environment (e.g., in Twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> etc.).  By monitoring postings of certain types of content within specific social networking environments, an originator of such content (e.g., an original post of a URL at a social network
website such as Twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> etc.) and the date/time at which such content originated can be determined by the search engine 10.
<br/><br/> Operation of the system of FIGS. 1-3 to monitor the posting of content such as URLs within a social networking environment and modifying the ranking of a URL based upon its established relevancy within the social networking environment is
described with reference to the flow chart of FIG. 4.  A social networking environment hosted by one or more social network servers 8 (e.g., Twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> etc.) is monitored to determine when any URLs are posted by a user/participant of social
networking environment (e.g., a user having a Twitter account, or a <b><i>Facebook</i></b> account, etc.).  The monitoring can be achieved by a search engine (e.g., using the social network monitor application module 28 of a search engine 10) and/or by any other
computing device.  For example, one or more social network servers 8 can monitor the content and report to designated search engines information associated with URLs that are posted within the social networking environment, including information
regarding a time stamp for when a specific URL originated or was originally posted along with the originator of the URL post (e.g., identification of the user who originally posted the URL).
<br/><br/> An example of monitoring of URLs posted within the social networking environment is in relation to a URL identified as URL X. Identification is made regarding when URL X was posted within the social networking environment (step 50).  For
example, a user or participant at a social networking environment posts a URL as part of content within the environment (e.g., by sending an email, a post, a blog, an instant message, etc.).  As previously noted herein, detection of the originating post
can be determined by a search engine 10 and/or by one or more social network servers 8 associated with the social networking environment.  The identification determines when the posting of URL X originated within the social networking environment (e.g.,
by recording a time stamp associated with the time and/or date of when the URL X was first posted) as well as optional additional information such as an identification of the user originating the post.
<br/><br/> The metrics about the website associated with URL X are also monitored to determine the number of accesses to the website via URL X both before and after the original posting of the URL X within the social networking environment (step 60).  The
monitoring of metrics associated with URL X can be achieved via the search engine (e.g., via the URL/web page data module 26 of the search engine 10) and/or via any suitable computing device (e.g., a computing device that hosts the content posted at the
website associated with URL X) that includes one or more software applications designed to monitor metrics associated with URL X. An example embodiment showing metrics associating accesses to URL X to clicks on a URL (e.g., the URL X or a short URL that
links to URL X) within a social networking environment is set forth in the Table below.  The example embodiment monitors the number of click-throughs within the social networking environment.  A click-through represents that a user has obtained access to
a URL via a short URL.  For example, in a Twitter environment, the number of Twitter clicks by users to gain access to URL X can be monitored.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 TABLE Comparing URL X Accesses With Postings Within Social Networking Environment Month Accesses to URL X Number of Click-Throughs March 2011 120 10 February 2011 80 January 2011 76 2 December 2010 103 5 November 2010 126 13
October 2010 28 September 2010 30 August 2010 37 July 2010 16
<br/><br/> As can be seen from the metrics in the table (obtained from steps 50 and 60), the originating post of URL X occurred within the social networking environment sometime around November 2010, since the first number of click-throughs associated with
URL X occurred in this month.  The number of click-throughs could be, e.g., the number of Twitter clicks that occurred within Twitter as a result of tweets and retweets (RTs) of URL X (or a short URL that links with URL X) in Twitter (e.g., 13 tweets/RTs
in November 2010 that include URL X in the tweeted content).  The originator of the post (e.g., the originator of the tweet that results in RTs) that includes URL X can also be identified, e.g., as user A.
<br/><br/> It is determined whether the number of accesses to URL X that occur after an original posting of URL X has increased to a number that is above a predetermined threshold (step 70).  This determination can be made, e.g., by the search engine
(e.g., utilizing one or more of modules 26 and 28 of search engine 10).  As can be seen from the data in the table, accesses to URL X occurring prior to the first or original post of URL X within the social networking environment averaged less than 30
per month (e.g., the average number of accesses over the two months September and October 2010 was 29).  After the original post of URL X within the social networking environment (as indicated by the first number of click-throughs occurring that led
users within the social networking environment to URL X), which occurred in November 2010, the average number accesses over the months of November and December 2010 was 114 ((126+103)/2).  In a scenario in which a minimum threshold for increase in
accesses to a URL such as URL X is 100%, the number of accesses starting at November 2010 would be above the minimum threshold, since the number of accesses increased by well over 100% in comparison to the previous month or an average of the previous two
or even three months.  The determination of the number of previous months to consider (e.g., one or more) in determining whether the number of accesses to an URL in any given month after the posting of the URL within the social networking environment can
be set to any suitable number based upon a particular scenario.  Thus, in the scenario in which the minimum threshold value is set to at least a 100% increase in accesses in comparison to a number of accesses for one or more prior months, the months of
November 2010 to at least March 2011 provide a number of accesses that exceeds or is greater than the established or predetermined threshold.
<br/><br/> In response to the number of accesses for a given time period (e.g., a month in the given scenario) exceeding the predetermined threshold, the relevancy weighting or ranking of URL X for any given search result determination is increased by a
certain amount (step 80).  For example, the weighting or ranking of the URL X can be increased by a set or constant percentage (e.g., 10% or more) based upon a determination (at step 70) that the threshold has been exceeded.  In other words, regardless
of how great the increase in number of accesses to URL X is for a given time period, the increase in the relevancy weighting for URL X remains the same.  In another example embodiment, the increase in relevancy weighting or ranking for URL X can change
based upon the amount or degree of the increase in relation to the threshold value.  For example, in the scenario described in which the minimum threshold is a 100% increase in number of accesses to URL X, when the increase in number of accesses over a
given time period (e.g., over a month) is within a first range above the threshold (e.g., between 100% to 200%), the increase in relevancy weighting or ranking applied to URL X can be set to a first value (e.g., increase relevancy weighting or ranking by
10%).  When the increase in number of accesses over the given period of time is within a second range above the threshold (e.g., between 200% to 300%), the relevancy weighting or ranking applied to URL X can be set to a second value (e.g., increase
relevancy weighting or ranking by 20%), when the increase is within a third range above the threshold (e.g., between 300% to 400%), the relevancy weighting or ranking applied to URL X can be set to a third value (e.g., increase relevancy weighting or
ranking by 30%), and so on.  In addition, the threshold value can simply be a predetermined number instead of a percentage increase.  For example, when a number of accesses at a URL during a given time period (e.g., day, week or month) exceeds a minimum
threshold value (e.g., 100), this can be the determination to increase the relevance weighting or ranking of the URL by the search engine within a search result based upon a search query.
<br/><br/> The relevancy weighting associated with a URL can also change over periods of time from which the URL was originally posted within the social networking environment.  For example, referring again to the table comparing accesses to URL X in
relation to postings including URL X within a social networking environment, it can be seen that November 2010, which is also the month in which the posting of URL X originated within the social networking environment, has a significant increase in the
number of accesses compared with the previous month.  The access number in December 2010 is also still large but then tapers off somewhat in the months of January and February 2011, followed by another increase in March 2011.  This can result in a
corresponding change in relevancy weighting, where the increase in ranking of URL X in the search results for the same search query will be less significant in the months of January and February compared to the months of November, December and March. 
The relevancy weighting can thus change over periods of time, resulting in a change in the amount or degree in which the ranking of URL X may be increased within a prioritized listing of search results.
<br/><br/> The relevancy weighting can be applied to the URL X based upon its ranking in the search results of a particular query.  A search engine (such as search engine 10) receives a search query (step 90) input by a user accessing the search engine
(e.g., via a website hosted by the search engine), where the search query generates search results that includes URL X. The search results are posted by the search engine (e.g., at the website hosted by the search engine), in which URLs found that are
relevant to the search are listed in a prioritized order of relevancy based upon the search query and the algorithm used by the search engine to find and prioritize search results that relate to the search query (step 100).
<br/><br/> In an example scenario, URL X is considered relevant to a specific search query and is thus provided within the prioritized list of search results.  The weighting of URL X is modified in response to the monitored number of accesses being
increased above a threshold value after an original posting of the URL X within the social networking environment (steps 50-80), and the prioritizing or ranking of URL X within the list of search results changes accordingly.  For example, in a search
result that initially prioritizes or ranks URL X as a rank number 20 based upon the criteria and algorithm(s) utilized by the search engine to find and prioritize search results given a specific search query (i.e., there are 19 other URLs considered of
greater relevance and thus higher in the search order than URL X), and given that the weighting of URL X is modified by 10% based upon its posting within a social network environment and a resultant increase in number of accesses to URL X, the 10%
weighting increase associated with URL X can change its rank number (e.g., increasing the rank number of URL X from 20 to 18 or an even higher ranking).
<br/><br/> The increase in ranking of a URL based upon a suitable increase in accesses to the URL after posting of such URL within a social networking environment can be applied by the search engine in a selective manner based upon the user at the
computing device that initiates a search query with the search engine.  For example, a participant of a social networking environment (e.g., Twitter) can initiate a search for content over the internet via a search engine 10.  The search engine 10 can
identify (e.g., utilizing module 25 and/or module 28) whether the computing device 6 initiating the search query is a participant or member of the social networking environment via its interaction with the computing device 6.  In another alternative
example embodiment, the user at computing device 6 can initiate a search query with the search engine 10 while operating within the social networking environment.  After a determination that the user initiating the search query is also a participant or
member of the social networking environment, the search engine 10 can determine whether any URLs found in the search based upon the search query should have a rank increase based upon the techniques described above and depicted in FIG. 4, and appropriate
changes to the search result rankings are implemented as warranted such that the listing of search results increases the ranking of such URLs determined to have an increase in relevancy weighting.
<br/><br/> As an optional feature, the relevancy of the posting of a URL within a social networking environment can further be assessed prior to making any changes in the relevancy weighting of the URL for a user initiating a search query with a search
engine.  For example, if a determination is made by the search engine 10 that the user initiating the search query is not a participant or member within the social networking environment in which the URLs have been posted, the search engine can determine
that no modification should be made to the ranking of URLs in the search results based upon posting of such URLs in the social networking environment.  This is because there is no special relevancy to this user of such URLs (since the user is not
associated with this social networking environment).
<br/><br/> In another example, consider a user initiating a search query who is a participant or member of a social networking environment but is not a follower or is not associated with any of the posts made within the environment that include URLs that
were found as part of the search result from the search query.  In this scenario, a determination can also be made by the search engine that there should be no relevancy weighting for any posted URLs in relation to the search results (i.e., the rankings
of these URLs will not change in the search results).  Alternatively, the search engine can apply a relevancy weighting to such URLs but with a lower value (e.g., a 5% increased weighting instead of a 10% increased weighting) in relation to the relevancy
weighting associated with a user who is a follower or is associated in some manner with the postings including such URLs.
<br/><br/> The search engine 10 (e.g., utilizing one or more of modules 25, 26 and 28) can also determine whether any relevancy weighting should be applied at all to a URL based upon the length of time that has occurred since any posting of such URL within
a social networking environment or any identified click-through by a member that resulted in the member accessing the URL via the social networking environment.  For example, if a specified period of time (e.g., 3, months, 6 months or 1 year) has passed
in which there has been no posting of content including a URL or the number of postings of content including the URL has diminished below a threshold value, the search engine 10 can determine that no further relevancy weighting should be applied to the
URL or that the relevancy weighting should be adjusted in some manner (e.g., reduced by a specified amount).
<br/><br/> The search engine 10 can also monitor the level of activity over a specified period of time within the social networking environment associated with the URL and use this information to adjust the relevancy weighting of the URl.  For example, the
search engine 10 can monitor a number of postings or the number of click-throughs to a URL that occur within the social networking environment (e.g., utilizing module 28) and over a given time period (e.g., within one month) and utilize this information
to further modify the relevancy weighting for a URL.  For example, if the Twitter account of a user includes a significant number (e.g., a predetermined threshold number) of tweets and RTs of content including a URL, or there are a significant number
(e.g., a predetermined threshold number) of Twitter through-clicks associated with the URL (e.g., via a short URL associated with the URL) and the number of accesses to this URL has increased significantly since the original tweet so as to exceed the
minimum threshold value for determining whether to increase the relevancy weighting of the URL, the search engine 10 can use this information to modify the amount or degree with which to increase the relevancy weighting.  For example, consider a scenario
in which, after an original tweet of a URL Z in January, the number of accesses to the URL Z increases to an extent that exceeds the minimum threshold value such that a relevancy weighting to be applied is set at 10% (e.g., the ranking of URL Z in any
search results by the search engine 10 will increase by 10% of its ranking prior to applying the relevancy weighting).  In February, the number of accesses to URL Z is similar to the month of January but the number of tweets and RTs of this URL Z
increases significantly so as to rise above a predetermined threshold number.  In this case, the search engine 10 can determine that the relevancy weighting should be further adjusted for URL Z to a higher value, such as 15%.
<br/><br/> Thus, the systems, computer program products and corresponding methods described herein facilitate an enhancement in providing search results for search queries utilizing a search engine (e.g., internet searches), where the relevancy of URLs
within one or more social networking environments is utilized as a factor to determine whether to modify the ranking of search results based upon such determined relevancy.
