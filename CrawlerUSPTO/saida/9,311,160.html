       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A device receives network infrastructure requirements, and determines
     availabilities of network resources based on the network infrastructure
     requirements. The device recommends one or more of the network resources
     based on the availabilities of the network resources, and receives
     selection of particular network resources from the recommended one or
     more network resources. The device also connects the particular network
     resources to create a virtual network template, and verifies requirements
     for the particular network resources. The device further tests the
     virtual network template, and deploys the virtual network template via
     the particular network resources when the testing of the virtual network
     template is successful.

         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method, comprising: receiving, by a device, network infrastructure requirements from a user, wherein the network infrastructure requirements include information of
network resources required for a virtual network to be implemented and the network resources include one or more devices;  determining, by the device, availabilities of the network resources based on the network infrastructure requirements;  providing,
by the device and to the user, recommendations of one or more of the network resources to be used in the virtual network based on the availabilities of the network resources;  receiving, by the device, user-selected network resources based on the
recommendations;  creating, by the device, a virtual network template for testing, wherein the user-selected network resources are logically connected in the virtual network template;  testing, by the device, the virtual network template;  and deploying,
by the device, the virtual network template via the user-selected network resources when the testing of the virtual network template is successful, wherein deploying the virtual network template comprises: performing a current state analysis of
attributes to operate the user-selected network resources, wherein the attributes include at least one of a bandwidth, processor utilization, memory utilization, or concurrent flows;  performing a future state analysis of the attributes;  modifying
security policies associated with the user-selected network resources so that the user-selected network resources can be instantiated;  instantiating the user-selected network resources, performing load balancing for the user-selected network resources; 
performing performance management collection, modeling, and tracking for the user-selected network resources;  providing a health check for the user-selected network resources;  and providing rate shaping requirements for the user-selected network
resources, wherein the rate shaping requirements ensure at least one of delivery of a priority application without delay, quality of service, defense against bandwidth-abusing denial of service attacks, protection against traffic spikes, abusive users,
or network attacks.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: verifying requirements for the user-selected network resources prior to testing the virtual network template, wherein the requirements for the user-selected network resources include networking
attributes required for the user-selected network resources, and the networking attributes include at least one of a bandwidth, processor utilization, memory utilization, or concurrent flows.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1, further comprising verifying requirements for the user-selected network resources prior to testing the virtual network template, wherein verifying the requirements for the user-selected network resources includes one
or more of: specifying at least one of performance management parameters, failover requirements, scaling requirements, and upgrade parameters associated with the user-selected network resources;  selecting network primitives for the user-selected network
resources;  preparing a resource plan for the user-selected network resources;  planning maintenance events for the user-selected network resources;  and preparing a scale and performance model for the user-selected network resources.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 1, where receiving network infrastructure requirements comprises: providing for display, to the user, a catalog of representations of the network resources;  receiving, from the user, selection of particular
representations of the network resources;  and determining the network infrastructure requirements based on the particular representations of the network resources.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 1, where the user-selected network resources provide a virtual network to subscribers of the virtual network.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 1, wherein the load balancing for the user-selected network resources is performed between two geographical locations.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: providing a cost of deploying the virtual network presented in the virtual network template.
<br/><br/> 8.  A device, comprising: a memory;  and a processor to: receive network infrastructure requirements, wherein the network infrastructure requirements include information of network resources required for a virtual network to be implemented and
the network resources include one or more devices, determine availabilities of the network resources based on the network infrastructure requirements, recommend one or more of the network resources to be used in the virtual network, based on the

<br/><br/> Network planning is required prior to installation of a dedicated network, such as a long term evolution (LTE) network or an evolved packet core (EPC) network.  Network planning is a time consuming process that includes identifying necessary
network resources and communications connections for the network, and determining appropriate locations for the network resources and the communications connections.  Once the planning is complete, the network resources and the communications connections
may be installed at the determined locations.  Network installation is both a time consuming and an expensive process.  However, such dedicated network resources and communications connections do not need to be installed when they are readily available
in data centers.
<br/><br/> A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications devices and storage systems.  A data center generally includes redundant or backup power supplies, redundant data communications
connections, environmental controls (e.g., air conditioning, fire suppression, etc.), and security devices. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings.  The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.
<br/><br/> Systems and/or methods described herein may provide a network architecture using cloud computing techniques (e.g., virtual machines (VMs), hypervisors, etc.) to operate, manage, and scale systems of the network architecture.  The systems and/or
methods may lay a foundation for a transition from dedicated hardware-based network systems to using data center class computer systems for virtual network implementation.  The systems and/or methods may create highly scalable virtual networks with lower
operational and capital costs than current dedicated networks, and may provide network primitives that collect operational information associated with the virtual networks.
<br/><br/> The systems and/or methods may provide an elastic cloud network (ECN) device that includes a session delivery network (SDN) component, a network hypervisor, a topology manager, and a catalog.  The SDN component may be responsible for managing
network primitives, which may lay a foundation for virtualization of other systems.  The SDN component may provide session continuity across a data center and/or a wide area.  The network hypervisor may include virtualization-based distribution network
infrastructure services, such as resource management, to dynamically and intelligently optimize available resources among virtual machines.  The network hypervisor may provide service levels and data protection for reliable and cost effective disaster
recovery, security, and integrity to protect an existing infrastructure from data center vulnerabilities.  The topology manager and the catalog may permit users (e.g., network administrators) to manage the virtual systems as though the virtual systems
were physically dedicated systems.
<br/><br/> The systems and/or methods may create and operate a virtual network infrastructure that virtualizes and aggregates data center devices and attached networks and storage into unified resource pools.  The systems and/or methods may support the
virtual network infrastructure by providing compute oriented systems (e.g., Internet protocol (IP) multimedia subsystem (IMS), analytics, fault management, performance management, etc.) that are currently provided as standalone hardware and software
solutions.
<br/><br/> In one example implementation, an ECN device may receive network infrastructure requirements from a user, and may determine network resource availability based on the requirements.  The ECN device may recommend network resources to the user
based on the determined availability, and may receive user-selected network resources based on the recommendations.  The ECN device may logically connect the selected network resources to create a virtual network template, and may verify requirements for
the selected network resources.  The ECN device may test the virtual network template, and may deploy the virtual network template, via the selected network resources, when the virtual network template is approved by the test.
<br/><br/> As used herein, the term "user" is intended to be broadly interpreted to include a user device or an ECN device, or a user of a user device or an ECN device.
<br/><br/> The term "component," as used herein, is intended to be broadly construed to include hardware (e.g., a processor, a microprocessor, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), a chip, a memory
device (e.g., a read only memory (ROM), a random access memory (RAM), etc.), etc.) or a combination of hardware and software (e.g., a processor, microprocessor, ASIC, etc. executing software contained in a memory device).
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example network 100 in which systems and/or methods described herein may be implemented.  As illustrated, network 100 may include a user device 110, an ECN device 120, and a network 130 that includes multiple network

devices.  In one example, user device 110 may include a device that is capable of communicating with ECN device 120.
<br/><br/> ECN device 120 may include one or more server devices, or other types of computation and/or communication devices, that gather, process, search, and/or provide information in a manner described herein.  In one example implementation, ECN device
120 may create and operate a virtual network infrastructure that virtualizes and aggregates network resources 140 and attached networks (e.g., network 130) and storage into unified resource pools.  ECN device 120 may provide a network architecture using
cloud computing techniques to operate, manage, and scale systems of the network architecture.  ECN device 120 may lay a foundation for a transition from dedicated hardware-based network systems to using data center class computer systems (e.g., network
resources 140) for virtual network implementation.  ECN device 120 may create highly scalable virtual networks with lower operational and capital costs than current dedicated networks, and may provide network primitives that collect operational
information associated with the virtual networks.
<br/><br/> Network 130 may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), an intranet, the Internet, an optical fiber (or fiber
optic)-based network, or a combination of networks.  In one example implementation, network 130 may include a network that interconnects network resources 140, such as data center class devices, together.
<br/><br/> Network resource 140 may include a device (e.g., a network device, a server, a computer system, etc.), data (e.g., availability information, license information, etc.), a service (e.g., a load balancing service, network information collection,
etc.), or any other type of resource available for a network.  A network device may include a gateway, a router, a switch, a firewall, a network interface card (NIC), a hub, a bridge, a proxy server, a multiplexer, or some other type of device that
processes and/or transfers traffic.  In one example implementation, network resource 140 may include devices, data, services, etc. provided in one or more data centers.
<br/><br/> Although FIG. 1 shows example devices/networks of network 100, in other implementations, network 100 may include fewer devices/networks, different devices/networks, differently arranged devices/networks, or additional devices/networks than
depicted in FIG. 1.  Alternatively, or additionally, one or more devices/networks of network 100 may perform one or more other tasks described as being performed by one or more other devices/networks of network 100.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a diagram of example components of a device 200 that may correspond to one or more devices of network 100 (FIG. 1).  In one example implementation, one or more of the devices of network 100 may include one or more devices 200 or one or
more components of device 200.  As illustrated in FIG. 2, device 200 may include a bus 210, a processing unit 220, a memory 230, an input device 240, an output device 250, and a communication interface 260.
<br/><br/> Bus 210 may permit communication among the components of device 200.  Processing unit 220 may include one or more processors or microprocessors that interpret and execute instructions.  In other implementations, processing unit 220 may be
implemented as or include one or more ASICs, FPGAs, or the like.
<br/><br/> Memory 230 may include a RAM or another type of dynamic storage device that stores information and instructions for execution by processing unit 220, a ROM or another type of static storage device that stores static information and instructions
for the processing unit 220, and/or some other type of magnetic or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive for storing information and/or instructions.
<br/><br/> Input device 240 may include a device that permits an operator to input information to device 200, such as a keyboard, a keypad, a mouse, a pen, a microphone, a touch screen display, one or more biometric mechanisms, and the like.  Output device
250 may include a device that outputs information to the operator, such as a display, a speaker, etc.
<br/><br/> Communication interface 260 may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables device 200 to communicate with other devices and/or systems.  For example, communication interface 260 may include mechanisms for communicating with other
devices, such as other devices of network 100.
<br/><br/> As described herein, device 200 may perform certain operations in response to processing unit 220 executing software instructions contained in a computer-readable medium, such as memory 230.  A computer-readable medium may be defined as a
non-transitory memory device.  A memory device may include space within a single physical memory device or spread across multiple physical memory devices.  The software instructions may be read into memory 230 from another computer-readable medium or
from another device via communication interface 260.  The software instructions contained in memory 230 may cause processing unit 220 to perform processes described herein.  Alternatively, or additionally, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or
in combination with software instructions to implement processes described herein.  Thus, implementations described herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
<br/><br/> Although FIG. 2 shows example components of device 200, in other implementations, device 200 may include fewer components, different components, differently arranged components, or additional components than depicted in FIG. 2.  Alternatively,
or additionally, one or more components of device 200 may perform one or more other tasks described as being performed by one or more other components of device 200.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a diagram of example operations capable of being performed by an example portion 300 of network 100 (FIG. 1).  As shown, network portion 300 may include user device 110, ECN device 120, and network 130.  User device 110, ECN device
120, and network 130 may include the features described above in connection with, for example, one or more of FIGS. 1 and 2.
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 3, a user (not shown) of user device 110 may provide network requirements 310 to user device 110.  Network requirements 310 may include information associated with a virtual network that the user wishes to implement, such
as network resources 140 required for the virtual network, capabilities associated with network resources 140, interactions between network resources 140, network primitives to be used with the virtual network, etc. User device 110 may provide network
requirements 310 to ECN device 120, and ECN device 120 may receive network requirements 310.  ECN device 120 may determine availabilities associated with network resources 140 based on network requirements 310 in order to ensure that network 130 includes
network resources 140 needed to employ the virtual network.  Based on the availabilities of network resources 140, ECN device 120 may provide recommendations 320 to user device 110.  Recommendations 320 may include a list of recommended network resources
140 of network 130 to be used in the requested virtual network.
<br/><br/> User device 110 may receive recommendations 320, and the user may select, via user device 110, representations of one or more network resources 140 from the list of recommended network resources 140 provided in recommendations 320.  The
representations of the user-selected network resources 140 may be provided from user device 110 to ECN device 120 via one or more responses 330, and ECN device 120 may receive the representations of the user-selected network resources 140 via responses
330.  ECN device 120 may logically connect the representations of the user-selected network resources 140 to create a virtual network template, and may verify requirements (e.g., memory, processor usage, bandwidth, etc.) for the user-selected network
resources 140.  Verification of the requirements for the user-selected network resources 140 may ensure that the user-selected network resources 140 may handle the requirements of the virtual network template.
<br/><br/> ECN device 120 may test the virtual network template, as indicated by reference number 340, by testing the actual user-selected network resources 140 provided in network 130.  For example, ECN device 120 may determine whether the actual
user-selected network resources 140 function as set forth in network requirements 310.  The testing of the actual user-selected network resources 140 may generate test results 350 that may be provided to ECN device 120.  Test results 350 may include, for
example, operational statistics (e.g., bandwidth, connectivity, flow rates, etc.) associated with the testing, errors (e.g., overload conditions, memory issues, etc.) encountered during the testing, etc.
<br/><br/> If test results 350 indicate that the actual user-selected network resources 140 fail to function as set forth in network requirements 310 (i.e., a failure), ECN device 120 may provide different recommendations 320 to user device 110 based on
test results 350 and may create a different virtual network template for testing.  If test results 350 indicate that the actual user-selected network resources 140 function as set forth in network requirements 310 (i.e., a success), ECN device 120 may
deploy the virtual network template in network 130, as indicated by reference number 360.  For example, ECN device 120 may enable user device 110 to utilize the functionalities of the actual user-selected network resources 140, as set forth in network
requirements 310.  As shown in FIG. 3, network 130 may make infrastructure of network 130, associated with the virtual network template (e.g., the actual user-selected network resources 140 of network 130), available to user device 110, as indicated by
reference number 370.  User device 110 may utilize the virtual network infrastructure in a manner similar to a dedicated hardware-based network.
<br/><br/> Although FIG. 3 shows example components of network portion 300, in other implementations, network portion 300 may include fewer components, different components, differently arranged components, or additional components than depicted in FIG. 3. Additionally, or alternatively, one or more components of network portion 300 may perform one or more other tasks described as being performed by one or more other components of network portion 300.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a diagram of example functional components of ECN device 120.  In one implementation, the functions described in connection with FIG. 4 may be performed by one or more components of device 200 (FIG. 2) or by one or more devices 200. 
As shown in FIG. 4, ECN device 120 may include a session delivery network (SDN) component 400, a network hypervisor 410, a topology manager 420, a catalog 430, and a network primitives component 440.
<br/><br/> SDN component 400 may be responsible for managing network primitives that may be required to implement a scalable virtual network.  SDN component 400 may also provide session continuity across network 130 and network resources 140, and may
function as an interface to a transport network.  SDN component 400 may provide transport from the network primitives to data storage devices, and may create a single virtual cluster across network 130.  SDN component 400 may select appropriate network
resources 140 based on requirements established in catalog 430, and may provide transport and security across network 130.
<br/><br/> Network hypervisor 410 may provide virtualization-based distribution network infrastructure services, such as resource management, to dynamically and intelligently optimize available resources among virtual machines.  Network hypervisor 410 may
provide data protection for reliable and cost effective disaster recovery, security, and integrity to protect infrastructure of network 130 from data center vulnerabilities.  In one example, network hypervisor 410 may provide carrier-grade network
resource management that ensures that selected network resources 140 are allotted the appropriate processing, memory, and storage resources.  Network hypervisor 410 may enable network administrators to operate and troubleshoot virtual networks using
similar tools and procedures used for dedicated hardware-based networks.  Network hypervisor 410 may work in concert with SDN component 400, topology manager 420, and network resources 140 to provide carrier class features that implement a virtual
network.
<br/><br/> Topology manager 420 may permit users (e.g., network administrators) to manage virtual systems created in network 130 as though the virtual systems were physically dedicated systems.  Topology manager 420 may enable users (e.g., via user
interfaces) to specify and view a logical network topology and how the logical network topology translates to a virtual network topology.  For example, topology manager 420 may enable a user to select which network resources 140 of network 130 to utilize
and how the selected network resources 140 are to interact with other network resources 140 associated with other virtual systems.  Topology manager 420 may provide the topology to SDN component 400, network hypervisor 410, and other systems in order to
create a complete virtual network.  Topology manager 420 may create a formatted high level design (HLD) document of the virtual network that may be used to assist in trouble-shooting the virtual network.
<br/><br/> Catalog 430 may include representations of network resources 140, capability information associated with network 130, availability information associated with network resources 140, license status information associated with network resources
140, operating requirements of network 130, etc. Catalog 430 may provide such information to a user (e.g., via user device 110), to SDN component 400, to network hypervisor 410, and to topology manager 420 so that virtual networks may be created and
managed.
<br/><br/> Network primitives component 440 may provide network primitives that may be accessed and utilized as needed by virtual networks.  The network primitives may provide a variety of services, such as fault management collection, performance
management collection, load balancing, etc. In one example, the network primitives may collect fault management and performance management data, and may transport the data to one or more storage devices for analysis by ECN device 120 or by a user.  The
network primitives may be automatically instantiated when a virtual network device is instantiated, and IP addresses for the network primitives may be presented by topology manager 420.
<br/><br/> Although FIG. 4 shows example functional components of ECN device 120, in other implementations, ECN device 120 may include fewer functional components, different functional components, differently arranged functional components, or additional
functional components than depicted in FIG. 4.  Additionally, or alternatively, one or more functional components of ECN device 120 may perform one or more other tasks described as being performed by one or more other functional components of ECN device
120.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a diagram of example functional components of SDN component 400.  In one implementation, the functions described in connection with FIG. 5 may be performed by one or more components of device 200 (FIG. 2) or by one or more devices 200. As shown in FIG. 5, SDN component 400 may include a load balancing component 500, a network address translation (NAT) component 510, a performance management collector 520, a performance modeling component 530, a health checking component 540, a
performance tracking component 550, and a rate shaping component 560.
<br/><br/> Load balancing component 500 may perform load balancing services for network resources 140 provided in a virtual network.  For example, load balancing component 500 may distribute workload across multiple network resources 140 to achieve optimal
network resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload.  In one example implementation, load balancing component 500 may employ different load balancing techniques, such as domain name system (DNS) based load
balancing, hardware based load balancing, and/or software based load balancing.
<br/><br/> NAT component 510 may perform NAT services for network resources 140 provided in a virtual network.  For example, NAT component 510 may modify IP address information in IP packet headers while in transit across traffic routing devices, such as
network resources 140.  In one example implementation, NAT component 510 may employ different NAT techniques, such as NAT 444 techniques, NAT 446 techniques, etc.
<br/><br/> Performance management collector 520 may collect performance management information associated with network resources 140 provided in a virtual network.  For example, performance management collector 520 may perform NetFlow-based traffic
collection, simple network management protocol (SNMP)-based traffic collection, session initiation protocol (SIP) flow information exchange (SIPFix)-based traffic collection, pilot packet-based traffic collection, etc. associated with network resources
140 provided in the virtual network.
<br/><br/> Performance modeling component 530 may provide performance modeling for network resources 140 provided in a virtual network.  For example, performance modeling component 530 may determine when a virtual network may scale (e.g., grow or shrink)
based on the performance modeling.  Performance modeling component 530 may determine what SDN component 400 resources to scale when new network resources 140 are provided in network 130.
<br/><br/> Health checking component 540 may perform health checking services for network resources 140 provided in a virtual network.  For example, health checking component 540 may perform a health check on network resources 140 with a particular
frequency, using a particular protocol, and using particular actions.
<br/><br/> Performance tracking component 550 may provide performance tracking services for network resources 140 provided in a virtual network.  For example, performance tracking component 550 may perform session and flow latency tracking, session and
flow packet loss tracking, etc. for network resources 140 provided in a virtual network.
<br/><br/> Rate shaping component 560 may perform rate shaping services for network resources 140 provided in a virtual network.  For example, rate shaping component 560 may manage bandwidth associated with network resources 140 to ensure that priority
applications are delivered without delay.  For network 130 and network resources 140, rate shaping component 560 may ensure quality of service (QoS), may defend against bandwidth-abusing denial of service (DoS) attacks, and may protect against traffic
spikes, abusive users, and network attacks.
<br/><br/> Although FIG. 5 shows example functional components of SDN component 400, in other implementations, SDN component 400 may include fewer functional components, different functional components, differently arranged functional components, or
additional functional components than depicted in FIG. 5.  Additionally, or alternatively, one or more functional components of SDN component 400 may perform one or more other tasks described as being performed by one or more other functional components
of SDN component 400.

<br/><br/> Network resources database 800 may include a database of information associated with network resources 140 (e.g., representations of network resources 140) that may be under the control of network hypervisor 410.  When a new network resource 140
is deployed in network 130, information associated with the new network resource 140 may be added to network resources database 800 once the new network resource 140 is certified as generally available by appropriate users.  If information associated
with a particular network resource 140 is provided in network resources database 800 and the particular network resource 140 has not been certified as generally available, the particular network resource 140 may not be assigned to a virtual network. 
Information associated with a particular network resource 140 may be removed from network resources database 800 by particular network administrators.

functional components, or additional functional components than depicted in FIG. 9.  Additionally, or alternatively, one or more functional components of network primitives component 440 may perform one or more other tasks described as being performed by
one or more other functional components of network primitives component 440.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 is a diagram of example data flows 1000 between functional components of multiple ECN devices 120.  As shown, a first ECN device 120 may be provided at a first location 1010, a second ECN device 120 may be provided at a second location

The third ECN device 120 may include a storage component 1050.  ECN devices 120 may share a common topology manager 420 and/or catalog 430.  ECN devices 120, SDN components 400, network hypervisors 410, topology manager 420, catalog 430, and network
primitives components 440 may include the features described above in connection with, for example, one or more of FIGS. 1-9.
<br/><br/> Hardware 1040 may include hardware components associated with network resources 140 provided in network 130.  Storage 1050 may include a memory device that stores information associated with virtual networks created and managed by ECN devices
120.  As shown in FIG. 10, a common topology manager 420 and/or catalog 430 may be provided for multiple ECN devices 120 so that the virtual networks created by ECN devices 120 may share network resources 140 without conflicts.  Topology manager
420/catalog 430 may communicate with SDN components 400 of different ECN devices 120 to ensure that network resources 140 are shared without conflicts.  SDN components 400 may communicate with each other to ensure that network resources 140 are shared
without conflicts.
<br/><br/> Although FIG. 10 shows example data flows 1000 between functional components of multiple ECN devices 120, in other implementations, fewer data flows, different data flows, differently arranged data flows, or additional data flows, than depicted
in FIG. 10, may be provided between the functional components of ECN devices 120.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 11A-11E are diagrams of example user interfaces 1100 capable of being provided by ECN device 120.  User interfaces 1100 may include graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or non-graphical user interfaces, such as text-based interfaces.  User
interfaces 1100 may provide information to users via customized interfaces (e.g., proprietary interfaces) and/or other types of interfaces (e.g., browser-based interfaces, etc.).  User interfaces 1100 may receive user inputs via one or more input devices
(e.g., input device 240, FIG. 2), may be user-configurable (e.g., a user may change the size of user interfaces 1100, information displayed in user interfaces 1100, color schemes used by user interfaces 1100, positions of text, images, icons, windows,
etc., in user interfaces 1100, etc.), and/or may not be user-configurable.  Information associated with user interfaces 1100 may be selected and/or manipulated by a user of user device 110 and/or ECN device 120 (e.g., via a touch screen display, a mouse,
and/or a keyboard).
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 11A, user interface 1100 may present a catalog 1110 and a network template area 1120 to a user.  Catalog 1110 may include representations of network resources 140 provided in network 130.  As shown, for example, catalog 1110 may
include representations of a serving gateway (SGW), a packet data network (PDN) gateway (PGW), a policy and charging rules function (PCRF), etc. The user may create a virtual network template in network template area 1120 by selecting one or more
representations of network resources 140 from catalog 1110 and moving the selected representations to network template area 1120.  As shown, the user may have moved representations for an eNodeB (eNB), a mobility management entity (MME), the PGW, and a
PDN from catalog 1110 to network template area 1120.  The user may also move a representation of the SGW from catalog 1110 to network template area 1120.  In one example, the user may attempt to build a virtual fourth generation (4G) wireless network
template by moving the representations of network resources 140 to network template area 1120.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 11B, after the user is finished moving the representations of network resources 140 to network template area 1120, ECN device 120 may logically connect the representations of the selected network resources 140 to form a virtual
4G wireless network template, as indicated by reference number 1130.  For example, the eNB representation may interface with the MME representation over a S1-MME interface, and may interface with the SGW representation over a S1-U interface.  The MME
representation may interface with the SGW representation over a S11 interface.  The SGW representation may interface with the PGW representation over a S5 interface.  The PGW representation may interface with the PDN representation over a SGi interface.
<br/><br/> As further shown in FIG. 11B, user interface 1100 may include a load information section 1140 that enables the user to input information associated with network resources 140 represented in the virtual 4G wireless network template.  For example,
via load information section 1140, the user may input a number of flows and/or subscribers associated with the virtual 4G wireless network template; identifications of one or more data centers to deploy to implement the virtual 4G wireless network
template; load balancing requirements for the virtual 4G wireless network template; etc.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 11C, after the user is finished inputting information into load information section 1140, user interface 1100 may present a network primitives section 1150 to the user.  Network primitives section 1150 may enable the user to
input information associated with network primitives to deploy with the virtual 4G wireless network template.  For example, via network primitives section 1150, the user may specify whether Netflow collection, SNMP collection, local load balancing,
session chaining, TCP optimization, Syslog collection, etc. are desired for the virtual 4G wireless network template.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 11D, after the user specifies the network primitives via network primitives section 1150, user interface 1100 may present a verify network elements section 1160 to the user.  Verify network elements section 1160 may enable the
user to input information associated with network resources 140 represented in the virtual 4G wireless network template.  For example, via verify network elements section 1160, the user may specify a number of processors (e.g., central processing units
(CPUs)), storage requirements, and memory requirements for network resources 140 represented in the virtual 4G wireless network template; may specify a number of VMs associated with network resources 140 represented in the virtual 4G wireless network
template; may specify a bandwidth associated with network resources 140 represented in the virtual 4G wireless network template; etc.
<br/><br/> As further shown in FIG. 11D, after the user is finished inputting information into verify network elements section 1160, the user may select a mechanism 1170 (e.g., a button, an icon, a hyperlink, etc.) that instructs ECN device 120 to test the
virtual 4G wireless network template in network resources 140 represented in the virtual 4G wireless network template.  For example, if the user selects mechanism 1170, ECN 120 may deploy the virtual 4G wireless network template in network resources 140
for testing, and may test the deployment to determine whether the virtual 4G wireless network template functions are desired by the user.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 11E, after testing the virtual 4G wireless network, user interface 1100 may present a test results section 1180 to the user.  Test results section 1180 may provide numerical results of the test (e.g., flow rates, bandwidth
usage, resource usage, etc.), an indication of whether the test was successful or unsuccessful, etc. If the test was successful, the user may select a mechanism 1190 (e.g., a button, an icon, a hyperlink, etc.) that instructs ECN device 120 to deploy the
virtual 4G wireless network template in network resources 140 represented in the virtual 4G wireless network template.  For example, if the user selects mechanism 1190, ECN 120 may deploy the virtual 4G wireless network template in network resources 140
for live use by subscribers of the 4G wireless network.
<br/><br/> Although user interfaces 1100 of FIGS. 11A-11E depict a variety of information, in other implementations, user interfaces 1100 may depict less information, different information, differently arranged information, or additional information than
depicted in FIGS. 11A-11E.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 12-15 are flow charts of an example process 1200 for providing elastic cloud networking according to an implementation described herein.  In one implementation, process 1200 may be performed by ECN device 120.  Alternatively, or
additionally, some or all of process 1200 may be performed by another device or group of devices, including or excluding ECN device 120.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 12, process 1200 may include receiving network infrastructure requirements from a user (block 1210), and determining network resource availability based on the network infrastructure requirements (block 1220).  For example, in
an implementation described above in connection with FIG. 3, a user of user device 110 may provide network requirements 310 to user device 110.  Network requirements 310 may include information associated with a virtual network that the user wishes to
implement, such as network resources 140 required for the virtual network, capabilities associated with network resources 140, interactions between network resources 140, network primitives to be used with the virtual network, etc. User device 110 may
provide network requirements 310 to ECN device 120, and ECN device 120 may receive network requirements 310.  ECN device 120 may determine availabilities associated with network resources 140 based on network requirements 310 in order to ensure that
network 130 includes network resources 140 needed to employ the virtual network.
<br/><br/> As further shown in FIG. 12, process 1200 may include recommending network resource(s) to the user based on the availability (block 1230), and receiving user-selected network resources based on the recommendations (block 1240).  For example, in
an implementation described above in connection with FIG. 3, based on the availabilities of network resources 140, ECN device 120 may provide recommendations 320 to user device 110.  Recommendations 320 may include a list of recommended network resources
140 of network 130 to be used in the requested virtual network.  User device 110 may receive recommendations 320, and the user may select, via user device 110, representations of one or more network resources 140 from the list of recommended network
resources 140 provided in recommendations 320.  The representations of the user-selected network resources 140 may be provided from user device 110 to ECN device 120 via one or more responses 330, and ECN device 120 may receive the representations of the
user-selected network resources 140 via responses 330.
<br/><br/> Returning to FIG. 12, process 1200 may include connecting the selected network resources to create a virtual network template (block 1250), and verifying requirements for the selected network resources (block 1260).  For example, in an
implementation described above in connection with FIG. 3, ECN device 120 may logically connect the representations of the user-selected network resources 140 to create a virtual network template, and may verify requirements (e.g., memory, processor
usage, bandwidth, etc.) for the user-selected network resources 140.  Verification of the requirements for the user-selected network resources 140 may ensure that the user-selected network resources 140 may handle the requirements of the virtual network
template.
<br/><br/> As further shown in FIG. 12, process 1200 may include testing the virtual network template (block 1270), and deploying the virtual network template via the selected network resources when the virtual network template is approved by the testing
(block 1280).  For example, in an implementation described above in connection with FIG. 3, ECN device 120 may test the virtual network template, as indicated by reference number 340, by testing the actual user-selected network resources 140 provided in
network 130.  The testing of the actual user-selected network resources 140 may generate test results 350 that may be provided to ECN device 120.  Test results 350 may include, for example, operational statistics (e.g., bandwidth, connectivity, flow
rates, etc.) associated with the testing, errors (e.g., overload conditions, memory issues, etc.) encountered during the testing, etc. If test results 350 indicate that the actual user-selected network resources 140 function as set forth in network
requirements 310 (i.e., a success), ECN device 120 may deploy the virtual network template in network 130, as indicated by reference number 360.  In one example, ECN device 120 may enable user device 110 to utilize the functionalities of the actual
user-selected network resources 140, as set forth in network requirements 310.
<br/><br/> Process block 1210 may include the process blocks depicted in FIG. 13.  As shown in FIG. 13, process block 1210 may include providing for display, to the user, a catalog of network resources/network capabilities (block 1300), receiving selection
of particular network resources/network capabilities from the user (block 1310), and determining the network infrastructure requirements based on the particular network resources/network capabilities (block 1320).  For example, in an implementation
described above in connection with FIG. 11A, user interface 1100 may present catalog 1110 and network template area 1120 to a user.  Catalog 1110 may include representations of network resources 140 provided in network 130.  In one example, catalog 1110
may include representations of a SGW, a PGW, a PCRF, etc. The user may create a virtual network template in network template area 1120 by selecting one or more representations of network resources 140 from catalog 1110 and moving the selected
representations to network template area 1120.  ECN device 120 may determine network infrastructure requirements based on the virtual network template.
<br/><br/> Process block 1260 may include the process blocks depicted in FIG. 14.  As shown in FIG. 14, process block 1260 may include specifying network attributes associated with the selected network resources (block 1400) and specifying one or more of
fault management parameters, performance management parameters, failover requirements, scaling parameters, and upgrade parameters associated with the selected network resources (block 1410).  For example, in an implementation described above in
connection with FIG. 7, attribute specifier 700 may enable a user to specify network attributes required to deploy network resources 140 in virtual networks.  Parameter specifier 710 may enable a user to specify parameters associated with network
resources 140 in virtual networks.  In one example, the parameters may include fault management parameters; performance management parameters; sample rates associated with the fault management and performance management parameters; protocols (e.g., SNMP)
associated with the fault management and performance management parameters; failover requirements; scaling parameters (e.g., maximum number of flows, maximum processor utilization, maximum memory utilization, scaling trigger points, maximum number of
virtual instances per location, etc.); upgrade and downgrade information; etc. associated with network resources 140.
<br/><br/> As further shown in FIG. 14, process block 1260 may include selecting network primitives for the selected network resources (block 1420), preparing a resource plan for the selected network resources (block 1430), planning maintenance events for
the selected network resources (block 1440), and preparing a scale/performance model for the selected network resources (block 1450).  For example, in an implementation described above in connection with FIG. 7, network primitive selector 720 may work
with SDN component 400 to select and implement appropriate network primitives in concert with the implementation of network resources 140 of virtual networks.  Resource plan creator 730 may prepare a resource plan that determines all required resources
when a network resource 140 for a virtual network is established.  In one example, the required resources may include a number of processors, memory, storage, transport information, security information, etc. associated with an established network
resource 140 for a virtual network.  Maintenance planner 740 may work with SDN component 400 to plan maintenance events for network resources 140 of virtual networks.  Model creator 750 may prepare predictive analytics-based models that provide past,
present, and/or future scale and performance information associated with virtual networks.
<br/><br/> Process block 1280 may include the process blocks depicted in FIG. 15.  As shown in FIG. 15, process block 1280 may include analyzing a state of attributes to operate the selected network resources (block 1500), performing a future state
analysis of the attributes (block 1510), modifying security policies of the selected network resources so that the selected network resources can be instantiated (block 1520), and instantiating the selected network resources (block 1530).  For example,
in an implementation described above in connection with FIG. 6, attributes state analysis component 600 may analyze a current state of attributes associated with operation of network resources 140 of virtual networks.  Future attributes state analysis
component 610 may analyze a future (or predictive) state of attributes associated with operation of network resources 140 of virtual networks.  Virtual network operation component 620 may implement network resources 140 of virtual networks, and may
ensure that network resources 140 are operating properly.  Security policy component 630 may modify security policies of particular network resources 140 (e.g., switches, firewalls, etc.) so that network resources 140 of virtual networks may be
implemented in accordance with security policies.
<br/><br/> As further shown in FIG. 15, process block 1280 may include performing load balancing for the selected network resources (block 1540), performing performance management collection, modeling, and tracking for the selected network resources (block
1550), providing a health check for the selected network resources (block 1560), and providing rate shaping requirements for the selected network resources (block 1570).  For example, in an implementation described above in connection with FIG. 5, load
balancing component 500 may perform load balancing services for network resources 140 provided in a virtual network.  Performance management collector 520 may collect performance management information associated with network resources 140 provided in a
virtual network.  Performance modeling component 530 may provide performance modeling for network resources 140 provided in a virtual network.  Health checking component 540 may perform health checking services for network resources 140 provided in a
virtual network.  Performance tracking component 550 may provide performance tracking services for network resources 140 provided in a virtual network.  Rate shaping component 560 may perform rate shaping services for network resources 140 provided in a
virtual network.
<br/><br/> In one example implementation, ECN device 120 may be utilized in the following example use cases to create the virtual environments defined in the example use cases.  Alternatively, or additionally, ECN device 120 may be utilized in other use
cases not provided in the example use cases.
<br/><br/> A first use case may include provisioning an IMS core network in a data center.  The user of ECN device 120 may utilize user interfaces 1100 to select network resources from catalog 430.  Topology manager 420 may import default attributes from
catalog 430.  Topology manager 420 may logically connect the network resources in a network, and may specify the number of flows/subscribers, a data center to be deployed, and load balancing requirements.  Topology manager 420 may provision fault
management and performance management elements, may specify network primitives (e.g., a SNMP collector, Syslog collector, and a Netflow collector), and may specify the number of flows per second for each network primitive.  Topology manager 420 may set
the AAA requirements to be used by the IMS core network, and may provision a CSCF, load balancers, and voice mail server IP Address for the IMS core network to use.  Topology manager 420 may set all network resource specific attributes, and may verify
requirements (e.g., CPUs, storage, memory requirements, number of VMs, etc.) for the network resources.  Topology manager 420 may verify that the network resources are available in the specific data center, may set the attributes to provision the VMs,
and may produce a formatted design document for the virtual network topology.  Topology manager 420 may deploy the IMS core network into the data center for testing, may approve the test configuration for deployment, and may deploy the configuration to
the production data center.

another topology.
<br/><br/> A twenty-ninth use case may include providing a process for releasing an ECN topology into production.  Topology manager 420 may be designed to ensure that a topology is tested and approved before the topology can be instantiated into a
production network.  Topology manager may be used to define the topology to include network elements, SDN settings, firewall requirements, DNS requirements, SLA settings, maximum concurrent flows, maximum concurrent sessions, maximum flows per second,
maximum sessions per second, etc. Upon creation of the topology, topology manager 420 may release the topology for testing and may determine that the topology can be instantiated in a test lab. Topology manager 420 may instantiate the topology in the
lab, and the lab may execute the required testing.  Upon completion of the testing, a user, via topology manager 420, may mark the topology as "Testing Complete," and the topology can be released to a First Office Application (FOA).  The user, via
topology manager 420, may deploy the topology into the production network, and may select a data center where the topology is deployed.  Topology manager may verify that there are sufficient resources in the data center to support the topology, and may

quantity of the VMs per location may based on reliability metrics defined in the topology, such as a number of VMs per server, a number of VMs per cabinet, a number of VMs per data center, etc. If the applications within the failure domain require
stateful failover, topology manager 420 may be responsible for instructing the applications that they shall share state information.  Topology manager 420 may calculate and provision the bandwidth required to share the state between the applications. 
Topology manager 420 may instantiate the applications and may push attributes (e.g., load balancing requirements, application health check parameters, failure actions, etc.) to SDN component 400.  If a failure occurs, topology manager 420 may be alerted
to the event.  When a failed server is restored, or additional server capacity is made available, topology manager 420 may deploy a new VM and/or application.  Topology manager 420 may push the configuration to a current application that the new
application is its new "mate." The applications may share state information with one another, and topology manager 420 may instruct SDN component 400 to load traffic to the array of applications within the failure domain as described within the load

changes in trends that may identify faults.
<br/><br/> A sixty-first use case may include providing data collection at network hypervisor 410.  For example, upon instantiation of a topology, topology manager 420 may use an API to install an analytics agent on network hypervisor 410.  The analytics
agent may collect SNMP, SIPFix, NEtflow, Syslog, etc. information directly from an OS socket to network hypervisor 410, and may move data to an adjunct processor.  The adjunct processor may transfer data to a core data repository.
<br/><br/> A sixty-second use case may include transferring SLA requirements to an analytics subsystem (of ECN device 120) to prepare a dashboard.  For example, when a topology is established, SLAs may be defined.  When the SLAs are set, topology manager
420 may send parameters to the analytics subsystem, and the analytics subsystem may set SLA parameters for the specific topology so that the dashboards reflect status with regard to the set SLAs.  ECN device 120 may present a dashboard specifically set

<br/><br/> A sixty-sixth use case may include computing network cost based on time of day.  For example, ECN device 120 may model behaviors of devices to identify a time of day when devices are not on a network.  ECN device 120 may permit a user to insert
a number of devices, a length of connection, a bandwidth required, a frequency of connection, etc. ECN device 120 may calculate, based on present loading characteristics of the network, when subscribers should connect and how much that would cost.  ECN
device 120 may permit the user to insert the above variables and specify a time for which the devices would connect, and may prepare a resulting cost model based on the request.
<br/><br/> A sixty-seventh use case may include using analytics to determine a scaling ECN.  For example, when an ECN architecture is created, ECN device 120 may enable the architecture to scale using automated processes.  When a virtual network is
defined, SLAs and scaling metrics for each component of the network may be defined in topology manager 420.  Trigger points for scaling each element in the topology may be defined when the topology is designed.  The virtual network may include a number
of virtual network elements and specific configurations that are defined to create a topology.  Topology manager 420 may instantiate the virtual network by determining the number of VMs required to operate the virtual network.  Each VM may include a data
collection agent that collects standard networking data, such as SNMP, SIPFix, IPFix, Netflow, etc.; and collects data from host computers, including disk reads and wWrites, CPU utilization, number of VMs on the machine, etc. The data collection agent
may aggregate the data, and may streams the data to a core data collections system.  The core data collection system may collect data from all data sources and may coalesce the data for each deployed topology.  Topology manager evaluate a state of the
deployed topologies, and may evaluate the data against the SLAs and scaling parameters to determine if the virtual elements in the topology need to be scaled up or down.  Topology manager 420 may recalculate the scale of each topology, and may leave the
topology unchanged, may recommend a resize event for the topology, or may automatically change the topology to satisfy a new sizing calculation.  Upon execution of this action, the changes to the topology may be transferred to an analytics engine.
<br/><br/> A sixty-eighth use case may include providing financial modeling.  ECN device 120 may collect a cost of virtual network elements in a topology.  The cost of each virtual network element may be provided when the element is loaded into catalog
430.  When a network element is placed in production, the cost of the element may be exported to an analytics engine.  The cost of virtual network elements may be based on country, state, region, area, site, topology, cost per unit of service (e.g., cost
per flow, cost per session, cost per DNS query, etc.), etc. Financial dashboards may be provided and may include a cost for forecasted growth, a cost if elastic models are applied, a cost per data center, etc.
<br/><br/> A sixty-ninth use case may include providing a network intelligence center (NIC).  For example, analytics may include a single point of entry from which they can be accessed.  A role based sign-on may be used to define what reports are visible
to each user, and a user profile may include all reports for that user.  The user may select the reports they wish to have in the NIC from a list of all available reports, and may add or remove reports from the NIC.  From a NIC start page, the user may
move from report to report, and the NIC may automatically logout after a particular idle time.
<br/><br/> A seventieth use case may include providing peak load predictions.  For example, ECN device 120 may review databases to determine likely times when a network will experience peak demand.  ECN device may correlate the data with current data
trends to validate and/or remodel a topology, and may provide this information to topology manager 420.  Topology manager 420 may recommend or implement changes to address changes in network resources.
<br/><br/> A seventy-first use case may include providing cumulative reliability.  For example, for each topology, ECN device 120 may perform a cumulative design reliability study, and may record a failure for each element in the topology, such as a VM
failure, a transport failure, a hardware failure, a software failure, etc.
<br/><br/> In a seventy-second use case, ECN device 120 may virtualize a HSS to support instantiation with each topology.  ECN device 120 may automatically replicate HSS data over multiple servers, and may automatically partition the HSS data so that each
server contains a subset of the total data.  A HSS server failure may be handled transparently by multiple virtual HSSs being represented by a single VIP.  HSS data may be versioned to maximize data integrity in failure scenarios without compromising
availability of the system.  Each virtual HSS may be independent of other nodes with no central point of failure or coordination.  ECN device 120 may provide pluggable data placement strategies to support distribution across data centers that are
geographically far apart.  Each virtual HSS may support ten to twenty thousand operations per second.  The virtual HSS may be modeled to operate in ECN compute elements, and the model may specify a number of ECN compute elements, transport, disk space,
data replication factors, etc. per virtual HSS.  The virtual HSS may be upgradable or downgradable, from topology manager 420, with no traffic loss.  The virtual HSS may support on-boarding of up to ten million devices in a single batch.
<br/><br/> A seventy-third use case may include creating elements in catalog 430.  For example, from a catalog menu, a user may select create new network element, may enter a server address (URL) for a master license server, or may create a network element
from scratch (e.g., VM, OS, provisional attributes, license server address, etc.).  An icon may be imported from the master license server, and if an icon is not imported, a generic icon may be selected to represent the network element.  ECN device 120
may import default attributes of the network element from the master license server, and may provide them to catalog 430.  A user may edit the attributes for each network element, may query the master license server to present the number of licenses
purchased and available, and may verify that the network element is imported and all attributes are set.
<br/><br/> A seventy-third use case may include passing virtual network attributes from catalog 430 to topology manager 420.  The virtual network elements in catalog 430 may include attributes for a network element, such as a name, a license cost, a number
of licenses in use, a number of licenses remaining, sessions per VM, flows per VM, a number of ECN compute elements required to operate, configurable attributes needed to be instantiated, etc.
<br/><br/> A seventy-fourth use case may include verifying a number of used licenses and available licenses.  For example, catalog 430 may query a license server to determine a number of licenses available, and may query topology manager 420 to validate a
number the number of licenses deployed.  Topology manager 420 may display the number of licenses in use and available on an icon to indicate availability.
<br/><br/> A seventy-fifth use case may include setting SLA requirements for the network elements in catalog 430.  For example, when a virtual network element is imported into catalog 430 a user may set the SLA requirements for the network element.  The
user may log-in, select an icon representing the network element, select set SLA from a context menu, and save the SLA settings.
<br/><br/> A seventy-sixth use case may include determining resource costs.  For example, when a network resource is added to catalog 430, one of the attributes may include cost per instance.  The network resources may include ECN compute resources in
addition to applications, VMs, analytics, and topology manager resources.
<br/><br/> In a seventy-seventh use case, ECN device 120 may provide a virtual IMS network that enables mobile to mobile calls, call forwarding when no answer, call forwarding to voice mail, mobile to mobile video calls, computer to mobile video calls,
video sharing, lawful intercept, DDOS mitigation, DDOS attack reporting, removing a SBC from service, adding a SBC to service, representing a SBC as a single IP address to all UEs, local authentication using EAP with mutual TLS, TSM tunneling support,
<b><i>Facebook</i></b> integration, etc.
<br/><br/> In a seventy-eighth use case, ECN device 120 may provide a virtual EPC network that enables M2M customer on-boarding; M2M policy provisioning (e.g., time of day use, bandwidth caps, customer group simultaneous connections, blacklist, stolen, or
hijacked devices, maximum concurrent connections, location, etc.); setting a strict time of day policy; setting a loose time of day policy; setting a congestion aware time of day policy; setting a strict bandwidth policy; setting a loose bandwidth
policy; setting a congestion aware bandwidth policy; setting strict customer concurrent sessions; setting loose customer concurrent sessions; setting congestion aware customer concurrent sessions; handling of no mobility; handling of M2M policy
violation; etc.
<br/><br/> Systems and/or methods described herein may provide a network architecture using cloud computing techniques (e.g., VMs, hypervisors, etc.) to operate, manage, and scale systems of the network architecture.  The systems and/or methods may lay a
foundation for a transition from dedicated hardware-based network systems to using data center class computer systems for virtual network implementation.  The systems and/or methods may create highly scalable virtual networks with lower operational and
capital costs than current dedicated networks, and may provide network primitives that collect operational information associated with the virtual networks.
