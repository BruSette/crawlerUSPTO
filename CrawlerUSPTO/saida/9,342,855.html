</font><br/>
       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A system having a dating website using facial images technology to match
     a first user to a second user having similar facial features and
     electronically introducing the users for establishing a dating
     relationship. The website further selects matches to the first user among
     the matches bearing a facial resemblance to the user based on
     complementary styles, values and compatible personalities. The website is
     accessed directly, through social networking sites or through mobile
     applications on smart phones and other handheld computing devices. The
     mobile application notifies the website where the user is and informs the
     user if any matching users are nearby or in the same location. If no
     matches are available in the location, the user photographs new
     acquaintances using the handheld computing device and uploads the photos
     to determine if the new acquaintances bear a facial resemblance to the
     user.

         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method comprising: via a computer system having a server with a processor: storing in a database, the database operative on a server of a computer system, said database
storing a plurality of profiles, each profile associated with a user, each profile linked to a facial image of said user, said profile and said facial image received from said user via said computer system;  calculating a digital face map for each user
using the facial image linked with said profile of said user, the calculations performed by a software application executed by a processor on the server, said face map a binary image for each facial image stored in the database, said binary image
processed by an edge detector;  calculating a Hausdorff distance between the digital face map of a first user and the digital face map of an other user, the calculations executed by the processor on the server, the processor continuing the calculations
until the Hausdorff distance between the digital face map of said first user and the digital face map of each other user having a profile in the database are complete and stored on the server;  ranking the calculated Hausdorff distances by the processor,
the smallest Hausdorff distance ranking highest, the processor retrieving from the database the facial image associated with the smallest Hausdorff distance;  and presenting for display by the server, the facial image associated with the smallest
Hausdorff distance, said facial image having a hyperlink to the associated profile, said server presenting for display said associated profile based on detecting an activation of said hyperlink by said first user, said profile stored in the server of the
computer system, said first user accessing said system;  wherein the step of calculating a digital face map for each user using the facial image linked with said profile of said user includes normalizing and aligning the facial image onto a template,
creating a set of points representing a shape of the facial image;  wherein said template is an outline of a face;  and wherein said outline is represented by an estimated fractal dimension.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method as described in claim 1, wherein said fractal dimension is mapped in an underlying metric space represented by a set containing a series of coordinates.
<br/><br/> 3.  A method comprising: via a computer system having a server with a processor: storing in a database, the database operative on a server of a computer system, said database storing a plurality of profiles, each profile associated with a user,
each profile linked to a facial image of said user, said profile and said facial image received from said user via said computer system;  calculating a digital face map for each user using the facial image linked with said profile of said user, the
calculations performed by a software application executed by a processor on the server, said face map a binary image for each facial image stored in the database, said binary image processed by an edge detector;  calculating a Hausdorff distance between
the digital face map of a first user and the digital face map of an other user, the calculations executed by the processor on the server, the processor continuing the calculations until the Hausdorff distance between the digital face map of said first
user and the digital face map of each other user having a profile in the database are complete and stored on the server;  ranking the calculated Hausdorff distances by the processor, the smallest Hausdorff distance ranking highest, the processor
retrieving from the database the facial image associated with the smallest Hausdorff distance;  and presenting for display by the server, the facial image associated with the smallest Hausdorff distance, said facial image having a hyperlink to the
associated profile, said server presenting for display said associated profile based on detecting an activation of said hyperlink by said first user, said profile stored in the server of the computer system, said first user accessing said system, wherein
the step of calculating a Hausdorff distance between the digital face map of a first user and the digital face map of an other user, said digital face map having a pair of said outlines of said facial images, said outlines represented by sets containing
a series of coordinates, a first set represented by X, a second set represented by Y, includes calculating said Hausdorff distance for the two sets X and Y with the following equation: d(X,Y)=sup{d(x,Y)|x.epsilon.X}.
<br/><br/> 4.  A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having a plurality of computer-readable instructions stored thereon which computer-executably implement a method, comprising: storing in a database, the database operative on a server of a
computer system, said database storing a plurality of profiles, each profile associated with a user, each profile linked to a facial image of said user, said profile and said facial image received from said user via said computer system;  calculating a
digital face map for each user using the facial image linked with said profile of said user, the calculations performed by a software application executed by a processor on the server, said face map a binary image for each facial image stored in the
database, said binary image processed by an edge detector;  calculating a Hausdorff distance between the digital face map of a first user and the digital face map of an other user, the calculations executed by the processor on the server, the processor
continuing the calculations until the Hausdorff distance between the digital face map of a first user and the digital face map of each other user having a profile in the database are complete and stored on the server;  ranking the calculated Hausdorff
distances by the processor, the smallest Hausdorff distance ranking highest, the processor retrieving from the database the facial image associated with the smallest Hausdorff distance;  and presenting for display by the server, the facial image
associated with the smallest Hausdorff distance, said facial image having a hyperlink to the associated profile, said server presenting for display said associated profile based on detecting an activation of said hyperlink by said first user, said
profile stored in the server of the computer system, said first user accessing said system;  wherein said medium implements said method further comprising the step of calculating a digital face map for each user using the facial image linked with said
profile of said user, said step includes normalizing and aligning the facial onto a template, creating a set of points representing a shape of the facial image;  wherein said medium implements said method further comprising said template, said template
an outline of a face;  and wherein said medium implements said method further comprising representing said outline by an estimated fractal dimension.
<br/><br/> 5.  The medium as described in claim 4, wherein said medium implements said method, said method further comprises mapping said fractal dimension in an underlying metric space represented by a set containing a series of coordinates.
<br/><br/> 6.  The medium as described in claim 5, wherein said medium implements said method, said method further comprises the step of calculating a Hausdorff distance between the digital face map of a first user and the digital face map of an other
user, said digital face map having a pair of said outlines of said facial images, said outlines represented by sets containing a series of coordinates, a first set represented by X, a second set represented by Y, comprises calculating said Hausdorff
distance for the two sets X and Y with the following equation: d(X,Y)=sup{d(x,Y)|x.epsilon.X}. <hr/> <center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> The present disclosure relates generally to a dating website using face matching technology.  More particularly, the present disclosure relates to system having a dating website using face matching technology that matches a first user to a
second user having similar facial features to electronically introduce the users for establishing a dating relationship.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Passion is often ignited when we spot someone whose features are similar to our own.  The visual portion of the brain signals our unconscious and we are innately drawn to people with features like ours.  In earlier times, people relied on
introductions by friends and relatives, who perhaps subconsciously recognized facial similarities between people and decided to initiate matchmaking.  Familiarity creates an instant bond when people meet for the first time.
<br/><br/> In the twenty-first century, with unprecedented mobility, people no longer can rely on friends and relatives for introductions because they are not nearby.  Just as for many other searches, people have turned to the internet to find potential
dates.  Online dating is one of the earliest applications developed for the Web.  Online dating is third in the internet's paid content category, behind online gaming and music, with approximately a billion dollar business annually in the United States
alone.  As many as one in five singles date someone they met on line, with many marrying as a result.
<br/><br/> Currently there are over 1,000 online dating sites, with the top 5 sites controlling eighty percent of the market.  None are perceived as "having the answer" and it is suggested that there is a high level of dissatisfaction with existing dating
site.  Despite this level of frustration by users, forty-four percent of Americans believe they have a better chance meeting a partner online than in a bar or club.
<br/><br/> Face matching software is well known in the art, generally relying on a user selecting specific facial features for matching or by ranking the results by which features match the queried face.  Others have developed a matching service based on
matching faces with an idealized facial profile determined by the user or matching to a celebrity in order to purchase accessories and fashions worn by the celebrity to enhance the visual similarity.  Using this matching service, others have proposed a
social networking website for linking people based on their faceprint.
<br/><br/> Others use visual data such as a photo to allow a user to sort through known contacts and determine the nature of the relationship with the contact based on the photos and metadata associated with the photos.  The system does not rely on facial
features to quantify the relationship but other factors in the photo.  The system does not help the user to establish a new contact but only sorts through the user's known online associates.
<br/><br/> None of the websites and services combines matching facial features with sorting the matches based on additional biographical data that characterize a user's style, values and personality.  None of services associate facial features of members
that are simply familiar without exactly conforming with each other.
<br/><br/> While these units may be suitable for the particular purpose employed, or for general use, they would not be as suitable for the purposes of the present disclosure as disclosed hereafter.
<br/><br/> In the present disclosure, where a document, act or item of knowledge is referred to or discussed, this reference or discussion is not an admission that the document, act or item of knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority date,
publicly available, known to the public, part of common general knowledge or otherwise constitutes prior art under the applicable statutory provisions; or is known to be relevant to an attempt to solve any problem with which the present disclosure is
concerned.
<br/><br/> While certain aspects of conventional technologies have been discussed to facilitate the present disclosure, no technical aspects are disclaimed and it is contemplated that the claims may encompass one or more of the conventional technical
aspects discussed herein.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY
<br/><br/> An aspect of an example embodiment in the present disclosure is to provide a dating website that is based on the science of attraction.  Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a dating website that matches a user with another user based on
the scientific principals of attraction between people bearing a facial resemblance to each other.
<br/><br/> Another aspect of an example embodiment in the present disclosure is to provide a dating website that is based on the art of attraction.  Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a dating website that matches a user to others bearing a
facial resemblance to the user, and further matches a user based on complementary styles, values and compatible personalities among those who bear a facial resemblance.
<br/><br/> Yet another aspect of an example embodiment in the present disclosure is to provide a dating website that allows a user to determine if a match bearing a facial resemblance and having complementary styles, values and compatible personalities to
the user is in the same location as the user.  Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a dating website that has a mobile application for a mobile computing device such as a smart phone that transmits the location of the user to the system and the
system notifies the user via the mobile application if a match is in the same location.
<br/><br/> A further aspect of an example embodiment in the present disclosure is to provide a dating website that allows a user to determine if a new acquaintance bears a facial resemblance to the user.  Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a
dating website that allows a user to photograph a new acquaintance using a mobile computing device such as a smart phone and upload the photo to the database of the system for analysis to determine if the new acquaintance bears a resemblance to the user.
<br/><br/> Yet a further aspect of an example embodiment in the present disclosure is to provide a dating website that targets Fusiform Gyrus in a temporal lobe of the brain of a first user when introducing a second user with a response of familiarity. 
Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a dating website that creates a simple map of each face in a database, using the general shape of a user's face and feature placement, finding a facial image of second user that will be familiar to a first
user, stimulating Fusiform Gyrus in the first user's brain.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, the present disclosure describes a system having a dating website using face matching technology to match a first user to a second user having similar facial features and electronically introducing the users for establishing a
dating relationship.  Similarity is based on creating a simple map of the face, emphasizing overall shape of the face and feature placement.  The website further selects matches to the first user among the matches bearing a facial similarity to the user
based on complementary styles, values and compatible personalities.  The website is accessed directly, through social networking sites or through mobile applications on smart phones and other handheld computing devices.  The mobile application notifies
the system where the user is and informs the user if any matching users are nearby or in the same location.  If no matches are available in the location, the user photographs new acquaintances using the handheld computing device and uploads the photos to
determine if the new acquaintances bear a facial resemblance to the user.
<br/><br/> The present disclosure addresses at least one of the foregoing disadvantages.  However, it is contemplated that the present disclosure may prove useful in addressing other problems and deficiencies in a number of technical areas.  Therefore, the

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram showing an overview of a workflow of the an example embodiment of the present disclosure.  The example embodiment is a system having a dating website using face matching technology that matches a first user to
a second user having similar facial features and electronically introducing the users for establishing a dating relationship.  The system further selects matches to the first user among the matches bearing a facial resemblance to the user based on
complementary styles, values and compatible personalities.  A database and software applications of the system reside on a server and are executed by a processor on the server.
<br/><br/> The user enters the system and starts 10.  The system is accessed through a portal such as the website 100 directly, through a social networking site 200 or through a mobile applications 300 on a smart phone or other handheld computing devices. 
The mobile application 300 notifies the website where the user is when the user checks in 310 and informs the user if any matching users are nearby or in the same location.
<br/><br/> The block diagram demonstrates the plurality of methods to access the website on a website server 40, and to register and upload photos and user data in a system having a database 50 of user data, including photos.  The block diagram also
illustrates the plurality of methods to contact a match once a user uploads a photo and the system determines a plurality of matches based on facial resemblance to the user photo.
<br/><br/> The user, desiring to use facial resemblance to search for a match to establish a dating relationship, accesses the website through the web portal 100 directly on the website, through the social network link portal 200, such as for, example, but
not limited to, Facebook.RTM.  (Facebook.RTM.  is the registered trademark of <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.) MySpace.RTM.  (MySpace.RTM.  is the registered trademark of MySpace, Inc., Beverly Hill, Calif.) or through a mobile application portal 300
downloaded onto a handheld computing device such as a smart phone or portable digital assistant (PDA).  When the user connects to the server 40 directly, the user registers basic identifying data 42 to establish an account and uploads a photo showing the
user's face.  The basic data includes for example, but is not limited to age and gender.  The user selects basic data preferences for matching such as, for example, but is not limited to, age range and gender.  If the user connects through the social
network portal 200, the user has the option of using a photograph already on the user's social network account or to upload a different photo.  If the user connects through the mobile application portal 300, the user determines if there is a photo
available 20 to upload from the device or takes a new photo to upload directly, using the device.  After uploading the photo and basic identifying data as well as basic data preferences, the system searches 52 the database, comparing the user's face with
the faces of other users stored in the database, finding at least one second user who bears a facial resemblance to the user and whose basic data matches the first user's basic data preferences.  The face matching technology selects the second user based
on a calculated minimum similarity factor based on analysis of facial features.  The system further limits selection to the second user having at least the minimum similarity factor and whose basic data match the basic data preferences of the first user
and whose basic data preferences match the basic data of the first user.  The system provides the matching second user to the first user.  If the first user is a registered member, the system provides a plurality of methods of linking to the matches. 
The user links to the matches through the social network by inviting the match to "friend" or link 210 to the user's social network account, "pokes" through the social network or through email 110 or through an instant message 312 to a smart phone.  If
the user is accessing the system through the mobile application, the user has the option to check-in 310 to the website by transmitting the user's location to the website.  The system determines if any matches are in the same location so that the user
can directly instant message 312 a local match and meet face to face if so desired.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates a further example embodiment, where the user initially searches for matches with similar facial features and becomes a member and chooses to find matches based on complementary styles, values and compatible personalities among
the matches who bear a facial resemblance to the user.  The user begins the process 12 by entering the website through the social network portal 200 or the web portal 100.  The website displays 110 the scientific principles of attraction based on facial
resemblances.  The website further explains the art of attraction based on complementary styles, values and compatible personalities.  FIG. 6A shows a display of the example embodiment in a website home page.  Those of ordinary skill in the art will
understand that the illustrative displays such as FIG. 6A and other drawings are to be interpreted in an exemplary manner and that displays different from those shown and described herein can be used within the scope of the present disclosure.  For
example, features of the displays can be combined, separated, interchanged, and/or rearranged to generate other displays.
<br/><br/> The non-member user can choose to find facial matches by selecting the button marked "Get Started" 112.  As displayed in FIG. 6B, the system displays a plurality of input box elements 114, such as text input boxes and drop down selection boxes
for basic data such as gender, gender sought, age, location.  Referring to FIG. 2A, the user registers with basic identifying data and preferences, uploads the photo 42, the system searches the database 52 for other users with similar facial features 56
and presents the matches 116 as described without identifying information, as shown in FIG. 6C.  The user can select a photo and the system displays an abbreviated profile, as shown in FIG. 4 without contact information.  As shown in FIG. 2A, the user is
presented with the option of subscribing 60 to a further search using complementary styles, values and compatible personalities and to be able to initiate contact with any matches initially found.  If the user does not desire to join, the user leaves the
website 14.
<br/><br/> As displayed in FIG. 6D, if the user subscribes, the user is presented a header 130 with identifying information 132 as well as a plurality of functions 134.  The user begins the new member registration process 34 illustrated in FIG. 2B.  The
user enters advanced biographical information 36 that includes information on style, value and personality.  FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B show an exemplary listing 120 of the information the user enters such as, for example, but not limited to, physical
characteristics, education, career, values and philosophy, activities and interests, as well as a short personal statement.  The user has the option of uploading additional photos or using the photo loaded initially or replacing the photo 122.  As
displayed in FIG. 7B, the user also enters information about what the user is seeking in a match 124 as well as contact information 126.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 2B, the user can upload a new photo for matching purposes 52, the system searches 54 through the matches already identified 56 or finds new matches by comparing photos in the database with the additional photos uploaded in the
registration process as having similar facial features to the user to find matches based on complementary styles, values and compatible personalities, which are more likely to be a better dating match than those based on biographical information alone,
as used by other systems.  The system presents a list of matches as shown in FIG. 9A as a photo array or as a list with brief information as shown in FIG. 9B.  In each display the system gives the user the ability to indicate interest or no interest or
undecided by choosing a check box from a plurality of check boxes 72.  The system presents the methods of contact 70 as described hereinabove.
<br/><br/> When the user returns to the website as displayed in FIG. 6A, the user can login directly or login through a social networking site.  The user also has the option of linking a social network account to the system account, allowing the system to
populate the user's system account with information from a profile on a social network containing the information on style, values and personality as well as sharing activity updates.
<br/><br/> Once the user has logged in, as shown in FIG. 6E, the header displays a number representing the new matches found in the system as well as a number representing the plurality of messages received for the user.  The user can selectively pull down
a list of new matches from the header, pull down a list of new messages, or select a dashboard pulldown option.  Referring to FIG. 2B, the user logs in 102 and selects the dashboard 62, allowing the user to simultaneously review new matches 64 and read
messages 66, as well as view recent activity other users linked to the user and which users have viewed the user's profile.  The other users who have viewed the user's profile can be displayed as part of the dashboard or from a Profile pull down menu 150
as shown in FIG. 9C.  FIG. 8 shows an exemplary display of the dashboard 62.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 2B, the user can upload a new photo for matching purposes 52, logoff 14, or request a new search 54 based on updated information or the new photo, to find better dating matches.  The system presents the methods of contact 70 as
described hereinabove.  The user logs off the system 14 when the desired tasks are completed.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5A shows a site map of an exemplary website of the system, showing the initial public view.  From the home page 500, the user can find out more about the system 510 of matching based on facial similarities, find out how it works 520, or
join and become a member 530.  From the menu to find out more about the system 510, the users selects to read about the science and art of attraction, to upload a photo, to find matches, to make connections or to see examples of compatible couples with
matching facial features.  If the user selects to make connections, the user is further directed to the registration process.  The user selects frequently asked questions (FAQ) to explain further how the system works 520.  If the user selects to join
530, the user enters the registration process.
<br/><br/> When a member logs into the system, the member sees a homepage with a dashboard 502.  The user selects to view the dashboard that displays described hereinabove in FIG. 8.  The homepage 502 offers pull down menus for the profile function 504,
the matching function 506, the account preferences function 508, the messaging function 512 and the photo management function 514.  The profile function 504 enables the user to select from editing the user's profile, viewing the profile, and viewing the
photos in the profile.  The matching function 506 enables the user to select to see new matches, to see connections, to see favorites, to ignore or block connections or determine who has viewed the user's profile.  The account function 508 allows the
user to change the account settings, the alert preferences and the privacy settings.  The messaging function 512 has an inbox, a sent or outbox, a composition function and a message detail function to select from.  The photo management function 514
allows the user to upload new photos and manage the photos previously uploaded to selectively choose which photos are displayed and used for matching.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates the mobile application for use on a handheld computing device, such as a smart phone or PDA.  Once the user is registered, the user then checks into the system 310, using a global positioning system (GPS) on the handheld
device.  The mobile application notifies the user if any of the matches identified by the system are in the location 314.  If a match is in the location, the user instant messages the match, connecting with the match and letting the match know that the
user is nearby so that a meeting can be arranged.  If no match is in the new location, the user has the option of taking photos 30 of other people, such as a new acquaintance and uploading the photos to the system to determine if the new acquaintance is
a facial match 54 for the user.
<br/><br/> A method that the system uses for matching and introducing the first user to at least one second user for establishing a dating relationship starts with the system storing at least one photo uploaded by the first user through the data portal
with the first user's basic data and preferences associated with the photo, and storing at least one photo of the second user uploaded through the data portal, with the second user's basic data and preferences associated with the photo.  Using face
matching technology, the system calculates a minimum similarity factor based on analyzing the photo of the users and the photo of the second user and optimally matching the facial features of the first user to the facial features of the second user based
on similarity factor equal to or greater than the minimum similarity factor as explained hereinbelow.  The system then compares the preferences of the first user with the basic data of the matching user and the basic data of the first user to the
preferences of the matching user.  For example, if the first user is a male seeking to meet a female, the system compares the basic data of the matching users, selecting only a female user seeking a male user.  The system displays a selected second user
through the data portal, the second user matching the facial features of the first user, the display limited to the second user whose basic data matches the preferences of the first user and whose preferences match the basic data of the first user.
<br/><br/> If the first user joins and becomes a member, the system stores the first user's style, values and personality along with the photo and basic data and preferences as well as the second user's style, values and personality.  The system then
further compares the preferences of the first user with the basic data of the matching user and the basic data of the first user to the preferences of the matching user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 shows a schematic diagram of a computer system that executes yet another example embodiment of the present disclosure.  The system has a server 400 with a processor 404, an input portal 402 operative for receiving a plurality of profiles
associated with the users and a plurality of facial images associated with said users.  The system has a database 406 for storing profiles and facial images.  The system has an output 408 for presenting for display the selected facial image, said image
selected by the processor 402.
<br/><br/> The method of the yet another example embodiment executed by a user desiring to use facial resemblance to search for a match to establish a dating relationship is performed on the computer system of FIG. 10.  A computer-readable storage medium
having a plurality of computer-readable instructions stored thereon which computer-executably implement the method described hereinbelow.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 11A, the steps of the method are outlined.  The steps comprise storing in a database on the server of a computer system 410, a plurality of profiles, each profile associated with a user, each profile linked to a facial image of said
user, said profile and said facial image received from said user via the computer system.
<br/><br/> A digital face map is calculated for each user 420, using the facial image linked with the profiles stored on the server.  The calculations are performed by a software application executed by the processor on the server.  The face map is a
binary image for each facial image stored in the database.  The binary image is processed by an edge detector.
<br/><br/> The processor calculated a Hausdorff distance 430 between the digital face map of a first user and the digital face map of an other user.  The processor continues the calculations until the Hausdorff distance between the digital face map of a
first user and the digital face map of each other user having a profile in the database are complete and stored on the server.
<br/><br/> The processor ranks the calculated Hausdorff distances 440, the smallest Hausdorff distance ranking highest.  The processor retrieves the facial image from the database the facial image associated with the smallest Hausdorff distance.
<br/><br/> The server presents for display 460 the facial image associated with the smallest Hausdorff distance, said facial image having a hyperlink to the associated profile, said server presenting for display the associated profile based on detecting an
activation of said hyperlink by said first user, said profile stored in the server of the computer system, said first user accessing said system.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 11A, the step of calculating face maps of profiles further comprises normalizing and aligning the facial image onto a template 422, creating a set of points representing a shape of the facial image.  The template is an outline
of a face, said outline represented by an estimated fractal dimension 424.  The fractal dimension is mapped in an underlying metric space represented by a set containing a series of coordinates 426.
<br/><br/> The step of calculating a Hausdorff distance 440 as shown in FIG. 11A, is executed by representing the coordinates of a first set containing a series of coordinates by X and a second set represented by Y is performed with the following equation:
d(X,Y)=sup{d(x,Y)|x.epsilon.X}.
<br/><br/> Yet a further example embodiment of system operative for introducing a first user to at least one second user for establishing a dating relationship, the system presenting a second user having a face similar to the first user is illustrated in
FIG. 12.
<br/><br/> The system comprises a server 420 connecting to a computer network 480.  The server stores a database 468.  The database stores data for a plurality of users, including basic data for a first user and a second user, the database digitally
storing at least one photo of the first user associated with the basic data of the first user, the database digitally storing at least one photo of the second user associated with basic data of the second use.
<br/><br/> The system has a software application 462 for processing on the server 460.  The server has a processor 464 for executing the software application.  The software application measures the facial features of the digitally stored photo of the first
user and the facial features of the digitally stored photo of the second user, said software application compares the facial features of the first user to the facial features of the second user, comparing a calculated minimum similarity factor, said
minimum similarity factor calculated from five components only of the facial features of the first user and said facial features of the second user.
<br/><br/> The system has a database management system (DBMS) 466 executed by the processor 464 on the server 460.  The DBMS 466 further analyzes the preferences of the first user and compares the preferences of the first user with the basic data of the
second user and the preferences of the second user to the basic data of the first user.
<br/><br/> The system has a data portal 472 on the server for receiving at least one photo and data from the first user and a data output portal 470 for selectively presenting for display the data and the photo of the second user having facial features
with a highest minimum similarity factor, the facial features stimulating a plurality of responses of recognition as determined by activity in a fusiform gyrus area of the first user's brain,
<br/><br/> The minimum similarity factor is a weighted average of the five components, said components are normalized measurements calculated as ratios.  The facial features digitally measured for calculated ratios are a face width, a face height, an eye
width, a chin width, a jaw width and a distance between a pair of eyes.  The five components are ratios normalized against a transverse measurement, such as face height and face width.
<br/><br/> The five normalized components are a face width to face height, an eye width to face width, a jaw width to face height, a chin width to face height and a distance between the eyes to face width.
<br/><br/> The weighted average of the minimum similarity factor is calculated by assigning the following weights: the weight of the face width to face height is 0.3, the weight of the eye width to face width is 0.15, the weight of the jaw width to face
height is 0.2, the weight of the chin width to face height is 0.2 and the weight of the distance between the eyes to face width is 0.15 in calculating the weighted average of the five components.
