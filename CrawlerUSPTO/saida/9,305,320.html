       <p> In particular embodiments, the newsfeed is rendered to a particular user
     using the locally stored copy of the resource, instead of pulling it back
     from the server-side. Thus, a user may see his or her content even before
     it is completely uploaded to the social networking system. In particular
     embodiments, the user may interact with the content, for example, by
     adding comments, captions, "likes", etc. to the content even before it
     has been completely uploaded to the social networking system. In this
     manner, the user is provided an increased feeling of responsiveness that
     is independent of the current wireless link condition.

<br/><br/> The present disclosure relates generally to a social networking and mobile devices and, more particularly, to the generation of an activity stream utilizing content provided by a remote server in conjunction with content cached or queued for
transmission on a client.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system.  The social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a user profile, in
connection with the user.  The user profile may include a user's demographic information, communication channel information, and personal interest.  The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user's relationship with other users
in the social networking system (e.g., social graph), as well as provide services (e.g., wall-posts, photo-sharing, or instant messaging) to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system.  The social networking system may
generate a webpage, or a newsfeed, for a particular user, comprising the recent activities of the user's first-degree connections on the social network.  Users utilizing mobile devices having data connections to the social networking system may upload
photos or perform actions remotely that appear on his or her news feed when the content is completely uploaded to the social networking system.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments relate to a social networking system that includes features directed to automatically generating a newsfeed that includes both server-side content and content that is stored on a client at least some of which is queued for
transmission to the social networking system stored on the client-side device.  These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following
figures. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example social networking system.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an example method of generating a news feed using both server-side content and client-side content.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an example news feed depicting server and client-side stories during the upload process.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates an example computer system.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates an example mobile device platform.
<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The invention is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.  In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding
of the present disclosure.  It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details.  In other instances, well known process steps and/or structures have not been
described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure.  In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the
disclosure to the described embodiments.  To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.
<br/><br/> A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it, and with each other through, the system.  Typically, to become a registered user of a social networking system, an entity, either human or
non-human, registers for an account with the social networking system.  Thereafter, the registered user may log into the social networking system via an account by providing, for example, a correct login ID or username and password.  As used herein, a
"user" may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.
<br/><br/> When a user registers for an account with a social networking system, the social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a "user profile", in connection with the user.  The user profile may include information
provided by the user and information gathered by various systems, including the social networking system, relating to activities or actions of the user.  For example, the user may provide his name, profile picture, contact information, birth date,
gender, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, and other demographical information to be included in his user profile.  The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user
considers to be his friends.  A list of the user's friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user's profile.  Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction.  For example, if Bob and Joe
are both users and connect with each another, Bob and Joe are each connections of the other.  If, on the other hand, Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam's posted content items, but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob, a one-way connection may be
formed where Sam is Bob's connection, but Bob is not Sam's connection.  Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections (e.g., friends of friends).  Connections may be added
explicitly by a user, for example, the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend, or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users (e.g., users who are alumni of the same educational
institution).  The user may identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user's profile.
<br/><br/> The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user (such as contact information and interests) at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time.  The user may also update his or her profile information at
any time.  For example, when the user moves, or changes a phone number, he may update his contact information.  Additionally, the user's interests may change as time passes, and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time.  A
user's activities on the social networking system, such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system, may also provide information that may be included in the user's profile.  Again, such information may be updated from time to time to
reflect the user's most-recent activities.  Still further, other users or so-called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user's profile.  For example, a contact may add the user as a friend (or
remove the user as a friend).  A contact may also write messages to the user's profile pages--typically known as wall-posts.  A user may also input status messages that get posted to the user's profile page.
<br/><br/> A social network system may maintain social graph information, which can generally model the relationships among groups of individuals, and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds.  A social network
may be represented using a graph structure.  Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network.  Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users.  In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is
defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other.  A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.
<br/><br/> A social networking system may support a variety of applications, such as photo sharing, on-line calendars and events.  For example, the social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities.  For example, the social networking
system may allow users to post photographs and other multimedia files to a user's profile, such as in a wall post or in a photo album, both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system.  Social networking system may also
allow users to configure events.  For example, a first user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event, location of the event and other users invited to the event.  The invited users may receive invitations to the event
and respond (such as by accepting the invitation or declining it).  Furthermore, social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar.  Similarly to events, the calendar entries may include times, dates, locations and identities of
other users.
<br/><br/> The social networking system may also support a privacy model.  A user may or may not wish to share his information with other users or third-party applications, or a user may wish to share his information only with specific users or third-party
applications.  A user may control whether his information is shared with other users or third-party applications through privacy settings associated with his user profile.  For example, a user may select a privacy setting for each user datum associated
with the user and/or select settings that apply globally or to categories or types of user profile information.  A privacy setting defines, or identifies, the set of entities (e.g., other users, connections of the user, friends of friends, or third party
application) that may have access to the user datum.  The privacy setting may be specified on various levels of granularity, such as by specifying particular entities in the social network (e.g., other users), predefined groups of the user's connections,
a particular type of connections, all of the user's connections, all first-degree connections of the user's connections, the entire social network, or even the entire Internet (e.g., to make the posted content item index-able and searchable on the
Internet).  A user may choose a default privacy setting for all user data that is to be posted.  Additionally, a user may specifically exclude certain entities from viewing a user datum or a particular type of user data.
<br/><br/> Social networking system may maintain a database of information relating to geographic locations or places.  Places may correspond to various physical locations, such as restaurants, bars, train stations, airports and the like.  Some places may
correspond to larger regions that themselves contain places--such as a restaurant or a gate location in an airport.  In one implementation, each place can be maintained as a hub node in a social graph or other data structure maintained by the social
networking system, as described in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 12/763,171, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.  Social networking system may allow users to access information regarding each place using a client application
(e.g., a browser) hosted by a wired or wireless station, such as a laptop, desktop or mobile device.  For example, social networking system may serve web pages (or other structured documents) to users that request information about a place.  In addition
to user profile and place information, the social networking system may track or maintain other information about the user.  For example, the social networking system may support geo-social networking system functionality including one or more
location-based services that record the user's location.  For example, users may access the geo-social networking system using a special-purpose client application hosted by a mobile device of the user (or a web- or network-based application using a
browser client).  The client application may automatically access Global Positioning System (GPS) or other geo-location functions supported by the mobile device and report the user's current location to the geo-social networking system.  In addition, the
client application may support geo-social networking functionality that allows users to check-in at various locations and communicate this location to other users.  A check-in to a given place may occur when a user is physically located at a place and,
using a mobile device, access the geo-social networking system to register the user's presence at the place.  A user may select a place from a list of existing places near to the user's current location or create a new place.  The user may also provide
comments in a text string when checking in to a given place.  The user may also identify one or more other users in connection with a check-in (such as friends of a user) and associate them with the check-in as well.  U.S.  patent application Ser.  No.
12/574,614, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes, describes a system that allows a first user to check-in other users at a given place.  An entry including a comment and a time stamp corresponding to the time the user checked in may
be displayed to other users.  For example, a record of the user's check-in activity may be stored in a database.  Social networking system may select one or more records associated with check-in activities of users at a given place and include such
check-in activity in web pages (or other structured documents) that correspond to a given place.  For example, social networking system may select the check-in activity associated with the, friends or other social contacts of a user that requests a page
corresponding to a place.  U.S.  application Ser.  No. 12/858,718, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes, describes an example geo-social networking system that can be used in connection with various embodiments of the present
invention.  The check-in activity may also be displayed on a user profile page and in news feeds provided to users of the social networking system.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the social networking system may provide a single webpage that displays the recent activity of the user's first-degree connections' actions on the social network.  This type of view, also called a "news feed," allows a
user of the social network to quickly view and access pertinent and temporally relevant information about his friends, interests, and pages the user has expressed an affinity to.  The news feed, in particular embodiments, also includes story entries from
the user's own actions on, and uploads to, the social networking system (such as status updates, wall posts, photo uploads, check-ins to a geo-social networking system).  In particular embodiments, the stories in the news feed are organized
chronologically.  In particular embodiments, the stories in the news feed are organized based on a social relevancy score calculated by the social networking system.
<br/><br/> In addition to geo-social functionality, the mobile device as described above may permit a user to remotely upload content, and perform other actions on the social network over a mobile data network.  In particular embodiments, the user may,
through his or her mobile device, upload photographs to the social networking system.  The rate of upload is limited by the rate, quality, and coverage of the data connection of the mobile client device.  In particular embodiments, the newsfeed is
rendered to a particular user using the locally stored copy of the resource, instead of pulling it back from the server-side.  Thus, a user may see his or her content even before it is completely uploaded to the social networking system.  In particular
embodiments, the user may interact with the content, for example, by adding comments, captions, "likes", etc. to the content even before it has been completely uploaded to the social networking system.  In this manner, the user is provided an increased
feeling of responsiveness that is independent of the current wireless link condition.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example social networking system.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store user profile data and social graph information in user profile database 101.  In particular embodiments, the social
networking system may store user event data in event database 102.  For example, a user may register a new event by accessing a client application to define an event name, a time and a location, and cause the newly created event to be stored in event
database 102.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store user privacy policy data in privacy policy database 103.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store geographic and location data in location database
104.  In particular embodiments, databases 101, 102, 103, and 104 may be operably connected to the social networking system's front end.  In particular embodiments, the front end 120 may interact with client device 122 through network cloud 121.  Client
device 122 is generally a computer or computing device including functionality for communicating (e.g., remotely) over a computer network.  Client device 122 may be a desktop computer, laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), in- or out-of-car
navigation system, smart phone or other cellular or mobile phone, or mobile gaming device, among other suitable computing devices.  Client device 122 may execute one or more client applications, such as a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Windows Internet
Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera, etc.) or special-purpose client application (e.g., <b><i>Facebook</i></b> for iPhone, etc.), to access and view content over a computer network.  Front end 120 may include web or HTTP server
functionality, as well as other functionality, to allow users to access the social networking system.  Front end 120 may also include a newsfeed generator that generates news feeds in response to user requests.  In particular embodiments, news feed
generator resides on one or more servers separate from front end 120.  Network cloud 121 generally represents a network or collection of networks (such as the Internet or a corporate intranet, or a combination of both) over which client devices 122 may
access the social network system.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store an information base of places, where each place includes a name, a geographic location and meta information (such as the user that initially created the place, reviews, comments,
check-in activity data, and the like).  Places may be created by administrators of the system and/or created by users of the system.  For example, a user may register a new place by accessing a client application to define a place name and provide a
geographic location and cause the newly created place to be registered in location database 104.  As discussed above, a created place may correspond to a hub node, which an administrator can claim for purposes of augmenting the information about the
place and for creating ads or other offers to be delivered to users.  In particular embodiments, system front end 120 may construct and serve a web page of a place, as requested by a user.  In some embodiments, a web page of a place may include
selectable components for a user to "like" the place, check in to the place, upload photos related to the place (in connection with a check-in or at a later time).  In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store geo-location data identifying
a real-world geographic location of a user associated with a check-in. For example, a geographic location of an Internet connected computer can be identified by the computer's IP address.  For example, a geographic location of a cell phone equipped with
cellular, Wi-Fi and/or GPS capabilities can be identified by cell tower triangulation, Wi-Fi positioning, and/or GPS positioning.  In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store a geographic location and additional information of a plurality
of places.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, users may utilize client device 122 to upload content or perform actions on the social network, such as status updates, wall posts, check-ins, and the like.  Typically, these actions must be transmitted through mobile
data network 121 to system front end 120, after which, when the user requests a newsfeed, the social networking system generates a news feed solely from server-side content.  Thus, any content or actions that have not been fully uploaded to the social
networking system will not appear on a user's news feed, regardless of when the user initiated the upload.  Upload times may be delayed significantly due to the state of the user's mobile wireless data link.  For example, if a user desires to upload a
photo while traveling, and the data connection is interrupted, the user will be unable to write a caption or comment on the photo until it is fully uploaded.  In particular embodiments, the client device itself may decide to queue one or more of the
activities for upload at a later time in order to, for example, conserve battery life.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an example method of generating a newsfeed incorporating both server-side and locally-stored content in accordance with one embodiment of the disclosure.  FIG. 2 is divided vertically to distinguish between actions that are
performed on the client device 122 on the left side, and actions that are performed on one or more servers of the social networking system on the right side.  In particular embodiments, one or more server-side process steps may be performed on the
client, and vice versa.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of dividing the method steps between the client or server.
<br/><br/> At Step 201, the user of client device 122 chooses to view his or her news feed.  In one implementation, the news feed may be embedded in a web page or any other suitable structured document that a client application can consume, parse and/or
render.  In particular embodiments, the user does this by invoking a specialized application, such as "<b><i>Facebook</i></b> for Android", on client device 122.  In particular embodiments, the client application utilizes a browser engine (e.g., WebKit, etc.) to
access a remote host associated with the social networking website, for example, www.facebook.com.  In particular embodiments, the user may utilize a specialized mobile WAP browser to access a mobile version of the social networking website, such as
m.facebook.com or touch.facebook.com.  In particular embodiments, the browser application on client device 122 includes an application programming interface that connects to the social networking website, regardless of the address requested by the user,
for example, Rockmelt for iPhone.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of initiating a request to view a news feed.  While this disclosure describes the generation of a newsfeed, a news feed is not required.  The requested page may be any
sort of web page, such as a photo gallery, forum, calendar, or message board.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable web content that incorporates both server side and client side data to be uploaded to the server.
<br/><br/> At Step 202, the server receives the request from client device 122 to view the user's newsfeed.  In particular embodiments, the request includes the social network user identifier (UID) of the user associated with client device 122.  In one
implementation, the social network user identifier may be contained in a browser cookie appended to the request.  In other implementations, the UID may be a parameter encoded in a URI string.  In particular embodiments, the request includes
authentication information to prevent unauthorized access.  In particular embodiments, the server will only respond to a request after the user has performed an authentication procedure such as logging in. In some implementations, access tokens can be
embedded in browser cookies upon successful authentication.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of identifying a specific social network UID for a given request.
<br/><br/> At Step 203, the social networking system begins to generate a webpage representing the newsfeed for the requesting user.  The webpage may be generated as HTML, XML, JavaScript, XHTML, or any other suitable markup language.  The web page may be
generated by system front end 120, a dedicated newsfeed generation application residing on one or more servers of the social networking system, a web server, or any other software application module residing on one or more servers of the social
networking system.  The web page created in Step 403 includes an embedded script (for example, a JavaScript having a .js file extension) that interacts with the local java interface of client device 122.  Although this disclosure describes an embedded
JavaScript object, in particular embodiments, the embedded object may be any scripting language or subset of JavaScript, such as AJAX, Action Script, CoffeScript, JScript, ASP, or VBScript.
<br/><br/> At Step 204, the social networking system pulls entries from the server database to populate the web page representing the requesting user's newsfeed.  In particular embodiments, the content may be pulled from an aggregate dynamic activity
stream of all users maintained by the social network.  In particular embodiments, stories or entries from the activity stream are matched against privacy policy DB 103 before insertion into the generated webpage.  In this manner, the user is not allowed
to view any content or activities from dynamic activity stream from users who have designated the user should not see.  In particular embodiments, the server pulls content and activities directly from user profile DB 101, event DB 102, and location DB
104, subject to privacy policies stored in privacy policy DB 103.  In particular embodiments, recent actions from the requesting user's first-degree contacts are inserted into the news feed.  In particular embodiments, updates from hub pages, businesses,
and other entities that the user has "liked" or otherwise expressed an affinity toward are inserted into the website generated in response to the user's newsfeed request.  In particular embodiments, the user may specify newsfeed settings designating
particular users, applications, or other entities whose stories should not be displayed.  Further description of news feed generation may be found in the commonly-owned U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,669,123, titled, "Dynamically providing a news feed about a user of
a social network," herein fully incorporated by reference in this disclosure.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of generating and managing the content of a particular user news feed.
<br/><br/> At Step 205, server front end 120 transmits the generated web page representing the requesting user's news feed to client device 122 over network 121.  Network 121 may comprise a plurality of different networks of varying transmission media,
such as a wired fiber network and a wireless cellular network.  In particular embodiments, system front end 120 transmits the webpage over a secure tunnel, such as a secure socket layer (SSL) tunnel or virtual private network (VPN) tunnel.  This
disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of transmitting the generated newsfeed to client device 122.  The transmitted webpage includes both the server-side stories pulled from the social networking system's dynamic activity stream or individual DBs
101-104, as well as the embedded script described above.
<br/><br/> At Step 206, client device 122 receives the transmitted web page representing the requesting user's newsfeed.  In particular embodiments, the JavaScript object embedded in the transmitted web page invokes a call to the local Java interface to
pull client-side stories or actions in local DB 106.  As previously explained, local DB 106 stores an activity stream of user content and actions that have not been fully uploaded to the social networking system.  For example, if a user had previously
initiated the upload of a photo and then immediately requested to view his or her newsfeed, at Step 406 the local Java interface requests the stream stories stored in local DB 106 to display the photo story in the user's newsfeed as if it had been
uploaded instantaneously.  In particular embodiments, the embedded JavaScript may be invoked by an onLoad, onClick, or other event, so that new client-side content may be pulled into the news feed any time the page is reloaded, or any time a user clicks
a link.  Although this paragraph describes a Java interface, this disclosure contemplates any suitable means of pulling local data for rendering.  In particular embodiments, the transmitted web page utilizes a browser API extension to pull client-side
stories or actions in local DB 106.  In particular embodiments, the transmitted web page utilizes a URL callback to pull client-side stories or actions in local DB 106.
<br/><br/> At Step 207, the local Java interface retrieves the locally stored stream stories and actions from local DB 106.  In particular embodiments, local DB 106 stores a copy of the content to be uploaded or in the process of being uploaded to the
social network.  For example, if a photo is stored on local storage of client device 122 separate from local DB 106, an exact or modified copy of the photo is stored in local DB 106.  In particular embodiments, local DB 106 stores a stream story in
accordance with a predetermined format specified by the social network and a pointer to the content, for example, a pointer or link to the photo in client device 122's photo storage memory.  In particular embodiments, actions on content to be uploaded is
also stored in local DB 106.  For example, a user may include comments, captions, or "likes" on any given piece of content to be uploaded.  In particular embodiments, these actions are stored along with a link or pointer to the content in local DB 106. 
Alternatively, the actions may be stored along with an exact or modified copy of the unuploaded content in local DB 106.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of storing content and actions, or pointers thereto, in local DB 106.
<br/><br/> In Step 208, the social networking application on client device 122 renders the received webpage including the stories pulled from local DB 106.  As previously discussed, the social networking application may be a specialized social networking
application, a standard internet browser, a lightweight mobile WAP browser, or a specialized browser interfacing with the social networking system.  The application displays the newsfeed to the requesting user as if the stories and the content in local
DB 106 were instantly uploaded to the social networking system, even if they have not completed, or even begun, uploading to the social networking system.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system arranges the server-side and client-side
stories in chronological order.  In particular embodiments, they are displayed based on a relevance score.  In particular embodiments, the relevance score is calculated based on a coefficient score between the user and the user generating the story.  The
coefficient score may take into account the degree of interaction between the two users, their similarity, their geographic proximity, and their affinities.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of organizing the ordering of stories in the
received news feed.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the application on client device 122 rendering the news feed includes an upload progress indicator below each story or piece of content currently being uploaded.  In particular embodiments, the progress indicator is a
progress bar.  In particular embodiments, it is expressed as a numerical percentage.  In particular embodiments, the user is provided a set of visual controls permitting the user to pause or cancel the upload.  For example, if a user uploads a set of
photos from a foreign country where his or her client device 122 lacks a data connection, and later decides not to upload one or more of the photos, he or she may select a "cancel" option to prevent the content from ever reaching the social networking
system servers.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an example of a user news feed 300 having both server-side stories and client-side stories that have not been fully uploaded to the social networking system.  Newsfeed 300 is the view generated by social networking system for
the user "John Smith." it includes filters for "Top News" and "Most Recent", which allow the user to sort the entries in the news feed by social relevance or chronologically, respectively.  News feed 300 includes server-side story entries 301 and 306. 
These, stories are, as previously discussed, pulled from server side databases or activity streams, and inserted in the transmitted website.  Newsfeed 300 also includes client-side story entry 302.  In this case, the user, "John Smith" initiated the
upload of 4 photos (although only three are displayed in this example), 303, 304, and 305.  Photos 303-305 are rendered to the user from the user's client device 122's local DB, and therefore are displayed in full-resolution and without any degradation
in quality.  From photos 303-305 alone, news feed entry 302 is indistinguishable from entries 301 and 306 to a viewing user.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, photos 303-035 may have progress indicators 303a, 304a, and 305a, respectively.  Progress indicators graphically or numerically display the upload progress of a particular piece of client-side content.  Whereas textual
content, such as comments, "likes", and check-ins, is uploaded fairly quickly, photos and videos take a substantial amount of time to upload, particularly where the mobile data connection is slow.  Thus, the user may upload a photo, and at any time,
request a view of his or her news feed and see a photo story such as 302 before the photo is actually uploaded to the social networking system's servers.  The user may also interact with the content by using the comment button 307 or the "like" button
308.  Thus, the user perceives the upload to be substantially in real-time; the moment he or she decides to upload content, the user may interact with it as if it were already existing on the server.  Thus, the disclosed embodiments enhance user
experience by masking delays in the uploading of content or other interactions by displaying a rendered representation of the locally stored data in connection with the server side content.  Additionally, reloading a web page representation of a newsfeed
may cause the embedded script to retrieve additional content from the client side.  Such an invention gives the perception of instanteous, real-time uploading of content and interactions.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, newsfeed 300 includes, for photos 303-305, pause button 309 and cancel button 310.  This permits a user to pause or cancel the upload of a piece of content.  For example, a user may inadvertently upload an
incriminating photo.  At any time during the upload process, the user may cancel the photo through cancel button 310 to prevent the file from ever reaching the social networking system's servers.  Therefore, in particular embodiments, the invention
enhances the user experience by removing delays in uploading content or other interactions via the display of a rendered representation of the locally stored data in connection with the server side content.  Additionally, a "reload page" may cause the
javascript or requested webpage to retrieve additional content from client side prior to its upload to the server.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates an example computer system 400, which may be used with some embodiments of the present invention.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable number of computer systems 400.  This disclosure contemplates computer system 400
taking any suitable physical form.  As example and not by way of limitation, computer system 400 may be an embedded computer system, a system-on-chip (SOC), a single-board computer system (SBC) (such as, for example, a computer-on-module (COM) or
system-on-module (SOM)), a desktop computer system, a laptop or notebook computer system, an interactive kiosk, a mainframe, a mesh of computer systems, a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a server, or a combination of two or more of
these.  Where appropriate, computer system 400 may include one or more computer systems 400; be unitary or distributed; span multiple locations; span multiple machines; or reside in a cloud, which may include one or more cloud components in one or more
networks.  Where appropriate, one or more computer systems 400 may perform without substantial spatial or temporal limitation one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein.  As an example and not by way of limitation, one or
more computer systems 400 may perform in real time or in batch mode one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein.  One or more computer systems 400 may perform at different times or at different locations one or more steps of
one or more methods described or illustrated herein, where appropriate.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, computer system 400 includes a processor 402, memory 404, storage 406, an input/output (I/O) interface 408, a communication interface 410, and a bus 412.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates a particular
computer system having a particular number of particular components in a particular arrangement, this disclosure contemplates any suitable computer system having any suitable number of any suitable components in any suitable arrangement.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, processor 402 includes hardware for executing instructions, such as those making up a computer program.  As an example and not by way of limitation, to execute instructions, processor 402 may retrieve (or fetch) the
instructions from an internal register, an internal cache, memory 404, or storage 406; decode and execute them; and then write one or more results to an internal register, an internal cache, memory 404, or storage 406.  In particular embodiments,
processor 402 may include one or more internal caches for data, instructions, or addresses.  The present disclosure contemplates processor 402 including any suitable number of any suitable internal caches, where appropriate.  Although this disclosure
describes and illustrates a particular processor, this disclosure contemplates any suitable processor.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, memory 404 includes main memory for storing instructions for processor 402 to execute or data for processor 402 to operate on.  As an example and not by way of limitation, computer system 400 may load instructions from
storage 406 or another source (such as, for example, another computer system 400) to memory 404.  Processor 402 may then load the instructions from memory 404 to an internal register or internal cache.  To execute the instructions, processor 402 may
retrieve the instructions from the internal register or internal cache and decode them.  In particular embodiments, one or more memory management units (MMUs) reside between processor 402 and memory 404 and facilitate accesses to memory 404 requested by
