<br/><br/> The present invention relates to telecommunication techniques.  More particularly, the present invention provides an integrated electrical optics multiple chip module and methods.
<br/><br/> Over the last few decades, the use of communication networks exploded.  In the early days Internet, popular applications were limited to emails, bulletin board, and mostly informational and text-based web page surfing, and the amount of data
transferred was usually relatively small.  Today, Internet and mobile applications demand a huge amount of bandwidth for transferring photo, video, music, and other multimedia files.  For example, a social network like <b><i>Facebook</i></b> processes more than 500 TB
of data daily.  With such high demands on data and data transfer, existing data communication systems need to be improved to address these needs.
<br/><br/> Over the past, there have been many types of communication systems and methods.  Unfortunately, they have been inadequate for various applications.  Therefore, improved communication systems and methods are desired.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to telecommunication techniques.  More specifically, various embodiments of the present invention provide a communication interface that is configured to transfer data at high bandwidth over optical communication
networks.  In certain embodiments, the communication interface is used by various devices, such as spine switches and leaf switches, within a spine-leaf network architecture, which allows large amount of data to be shared among servers.
<br/><br/> In modern electrical interconnect systems, high-speed serial links have replaced parallel data buses, and serial link speed is rapidly increasing due to the evolution of CMOS technology.  Internet bandwidth doubles almost every two years
following Moore's Law.  But Moore's Law is coming to an end in the next decade.  Standard CMOS silicon transistors will stop scaling around 5 nm.  And the internet bandwidth increasing due to process scaling will plateau.  But Internet and mobile
applications continuously demand a huge amount of bandwidth for transferring photo, video, music, and other multimedia files.  This disclosure describes techniques and methods to improve the communication bandwidth beyond Moore's law.
<br/><br/> Serial link performance is limited by the channel electrical bandwidth and the electronic components.  In order to resolve the inter-symbol interference (ISI) problems caused by bandwidth limitations, we need to bring all electrical components
as close as possible to reduce the distance or channel length among them.  Stacking chips into so-called 3-D ICs promises a one-time boost in their capabilities, but it's very expensive.  Another way to achieve this goal in this disclosure is to use
multiple chip module technology.
<br/><br/> In an example, an alternative method to increase the bandwidth is to move the optical devices close to electrical device.  Silicon photonics is an important technology for moving optics closer to silicon.  In this patent application, we will
disclose a high speed electrical optics multiple chip module device to achieve terabits per second speed, as well as variations thereof.
<br/><br/> In an alternative example, the present invention includes an integrated system on chip device.  The device is configured on a single silicon substrate member.  The device has a data input/output interface provided on the substrate member and

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> This present invention relates to telecommunication techniques.  More specifically, various embodiments of the present invention provide a communication interface that is configured to transfer data at high bandwidth over optical communication
networks.  In certain embodiments, the communication interface is used by various devices, such as spine switches and leaf switches, within a spine-leaf network architecture, which allows large amount of data to be shared among servers.
<br/><br/> In the last decades, with advent of cloud computing and data center, the needs for network servers have evolved.  For example, the three-level configuration that have been used for a long time is no longer adequate or suitable, as distributed
applications require flatter network architectures, where server virtualization that allows servers to operate in parallel.  For example, multiple servers can be used together to perform a requested task.  For multiple servers to work in parallel, it is
often imperative for them to be share large amount of information among themselves quickly, as opposed to having data going back forth through multiple layers of network architecture (e.g., network switches, etc.).
<br/><br/> Leaf-spine type of network architecture is provided to better allow servers to work in parallel and move data quickly among servers, offering high bandwidth and low latencies.  Typically, a leaf-spine network architecture uses a top-of-rack
switch that can directly access into server nodes and links back to a set of non-blocking spine switches that have enough bandwidth to allow for clusters of servers to be linked to one another and share large amount of data.
<br/><br/> In a typical leaf-spine network today, gigabits of data are shared among servers.  In certain network architectures, network servers on the same level have certain peer links for data sharing.  Unfortunately, the bandwidth for this type of set
up is often inadequate.  It is to be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention utilizes PAM (e.g., PAM8, PAM12, PAM16, etc.) in leaf-spine architecture that allows large amount (up terabytes of data at the spine level) of data to be
transferred via optical network.
<br/><br/> The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and to incorporate it in the context of particular applications.  Various modifications, as well as a variety of uses in different

<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a simplified diagram of a single hybrid die (Both electrical and optics devices are fabricated on a single hybrid die) according to an embodiment of the present invention.  In an example, the present device 100 comprises a single
hybrid communication module made of silicon material.  The module comprises a substrate member 110 having a surface region, an electrical silicon chip 120 overlying a first portion of the surface region, an silicon photonics device 130 overlying a second
portion of the surface region, a communication bus coupled between the electrical silicon chip and the silicon photonics device, an optical interface 131 coupled to the silicon photonics device 130, and an electrical interface 121 coupled to the
electrical silicon die 120.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a simplified diagram of a multi-chip module according to an embodiment of the present invention.  In an example, the present device 200 comprises a single hybrid communication module.  The module comprises a substrate member 210 having
a surface region, which can be a printed circuit board or other member.  The module comprises an electrical silicon chip 220 overlying a first portion of the surface region, a silicon photonics device 230 overlying a second portion of the surface region,
a communication bus 240 coupled between the electrical silicon chip and the silicon photonics device, an optical interface 231 coupled to the silicon photonics device 230, and an electrical interface 221 coupled to the electrical silicon die 220.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 1, the single hybrid die includes a hybrid silicon photonics device having an electrical circuit for processing and control and a silicon photonics module.  In an example, the hybrid silicon photonics device is described in U.S. Pat.  No. 8,380,033, in the name of Fang, et al. issued Feb.  19, 2013, hereby incorporated by reference.  FIG. 2A shows a simplified block diagram of an exemplary hybrid silicon photonics device.
<br/><br/> In this example, electro-optic device 200 includes a silicon semiconductor slab including silicon top layer 201, vertical confinement layer 202 and silicon substrate 203.  Alternatively, substrate layer 203 may be a diamond substrate, a glass
substrate, or any functional equivalent.  Vertical confinement layer 202 may be formed of any dielectric material suitable for confining an optical mode (e.g., layer 201 may be a silicon dioxide layer, a silicon nitride layer, or any functionally
equivalent insulating layer with a refractive index lower than silicon top layer 201).
<br/><br/> Device 200 further includes a III-V semiconductor slab including p-type layer 208, active layer 209 and n-type layer 210 (thereby forming a P-I-N diode).  The term "p-type layer," as used herein, describes a layer comprising a material that has
more positive carriers (i.e., holes) than negative carriers (i.e., electrons).  The term "n-type layer," as used herein, describes a layer comprising a material that has more negative carriers than positive carriers.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, layer 208 may be an n-type layer, and layer 210 may be a p-type layer.  Or, layers 208 and 210 may be n-type layers, while active region 209 may include a tunnel junction to convert n-type majority carriers to p-type majority
carriers.  This avoids the associated optical and microwave loss of p-type materials due to the use of p-dopants.
<br/><br/> III-V semiconductor materials have elements that are found in group III and group V of the periodic table (e.g., Indium Gallium Arsenide Phosphide, Gallium Indium Arsenide Nitride).  The carrier dispersion effects of III-V based materials may be
significantly higher than in silicon based materials for bandgaps closer to the wavelength of the light being transmitted or modulated, as electron speed in III-V semiconductors is much faster than that in silicon.  In addition, III-V materials have a
direct bandgap which is required for the most efficient creation of light from electrical pumping.  Thus, III-V semiconductor materials enable photonic operations with an increased efficiency over silicon for both generating light and modulating the
refractive index of light.
<br/><br/> Active layer 209 is of a III-V semiconductor with high electro-optic efficiency, i.e., the absorption coefficient (i.e., the imaginary portion of the complex refractive index) and the refractive index (i.e., the real portion of the complex
refractive index) of active layer 209 is easily affected by either the Franz Kheldysh effect if active layer 209 comprises bulk material (e.g., intrinsic Indium Gallium Arsenide Phosphide or Indium Aluminum Gallium Arsenide or the Quantum Confined Stark
Effect if active layer 209 comprises multiple quantum wells.
<br/><br/> Optical waveguide 250 is formed by ridge 260 (which is "bolded" or "thicker" in the figure for illustrative purposes only), including ridge sides 261 and 262.  It is clear that in this embodiment, waveguide 250 is formed by features in the III-V
region of device 200 as opposed to being formed by features in the silicon region of the device, wherein waveguide is formed by voids included in silicon top region.  Thus, the silicon and III-V regions of device 200 have a greater contact area than
devices in the prior art (where layer 210 was continuously coupled to layer 201).
<br/><br/> Overclad regions 207 may be formed on the device to improve mechanical stability, and may be of any material used to form vertical confinement layer 202 or any material with a lower refractive index than layer 208.  Overclad regions 207 further
provide vertical optical confinement and passivation as described below.  The areas adjacent to ridge sides 261 and 262 provide optical confinement if left as voids (i.e., areas comprising air), but that forming overclad regions 207 provides for
mechanical stability in addition to optical confinement.
<br/><br/> Thus, optical mode 213 is vertically confined by vertical confinement layer 202, ridge 260 and overclad regions 207 while being laterally confined by ridge sides 261 and 262.  Said ridge sides also confine injection current from electrode 206
towards the portion of active layer 209 that overlaps optical mode 213.  The need for the etched regions and implanted regions is eliminated in the example shown above.
<br/><br/> It is understood that the optical device of FIG. 2A may be used to amplify, modulate or detect light transmitted through the optical waveguide of the device by applying an electrical difference to complimentary electrodes 206 and 212 to either
forward bias (i.e., for amplification) or reverse bias (i.e., for modulation or detection) the structure.  The complex refractive index (i.e., at least one of the real and the imaginary refractive index) of at least the portion of active layer 209
included in optical mode 213 changes based on an electrical difference (e.g., electrical voltage, electrical field) applied to electrodes 206 and 212.  These changes to the refractive index (or indexes) are proportional to the strength of the electrical
difference applied to electrodes 206 and 212.
<br/><br/> In this example, electrodes 212 are coupled to n-type layer 210.  Thus, it is to be understood that there is no electrical conduction through silicon top layer 201.  As opposed to variations where electrical conduction does occur through the
silicon top layer of a device, resistance is high as it determined by thin layer 210; however, there are less processing steps needed to create device 200 and no conductive bond is required to couple the silicon region with the III-V region (i.e., no
conductive bond is required to couple layers 210 and 201).

<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a simplified diagram of an electrical silicon die block according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art
would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  In an embodiment, the electrical silicon die block 300 is an electrical signal processing block that connects a low speed electrical interface to a high speed optical interface.  There
are several elements to this block diagram.  As shown, the electrical silicon die block 300 includes a high speed serial link 310, a digital signal processing/pre-distortion unit 320, and a laser modulator driver and TIA unit 330.  The high speed serial
link 310 includes an input/output block having an RX (receiving) functional unit and a TX (transmitting) function unit coupled to a phase lock loop circuit.  For example, the TX function unit drives the loopback signals that are processed by the RX
functional unit.  Using the high speed serial link 310, the data first is able to be converted from the many parallel streams of lower speed data into a high speed serial stream (there may be more than one such high speed stream depending on the total
data rate).  The digital signal processing/pre-distortion unit 320 is configured to process or convert digital electrical signal back and forth to optical signal and conduct all signal modulation, error encoding/decoding, and signal distortion
compensation.  The high speed streams converted by the high speed serial link 310 are then encoded and digitally compensated to account for distortions in the transmit and receive paths.  The final interface to the optical components is achieved via the
modulator driver (transmit path) and the transimpedance amplifier (receive path).  The laser modulator driver and TIA unit 330 is configured to control the optical device (such as the optics silicon photonics die on the part of the multi-chip module in
FIG. 2).  In a specific embodiment, the electrical silicon die block 300 is a single hybrid die as part of the multi-chip module shown in FIG. 2.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a simplified diagram of high speed serial link block according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art
would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown, the present device 400 is a high speed serial link block which provides details of the signal interface between the high speed optical and the lower speed electrical sides.  In
an embodiment, the high speed serial link block comprises multiple Bits Flash Samplers 450 and an all-digital SerDes core unit 410 powered under a low Vdd power supply.  The samplers 450 are part of RX functional unit of the input/output block 310.  The
all-digital SerDes core unit 410 comprises an all digital phase lock loop (PLL) block 420, a fast lock CDR block 430, and Digital offset calibrations and logics block 440, also belonging to the RX functional unit (310 of FIG. 3).  In another embodiment,
the high speed serial link block is an electrical input/output block provided on either a single chip or a silicon die of package substrate member and coupled to the data input/output interface.  Some of the essential components of the electrical
input/output block are CDR (clock and data recovery circuits), PLL (phase lock loops), and SerDes (Serializers and Deserializers).  In an example, the input/output block comprises a SerDes block, a CDR block, a compensation block, and an equalizer block,
among others.  The output of equalizer includes receiver input.  These circuits in combination convert multiple streams of input data (electrical side) to fewer streams of output data (optical side).  These circuits also need to be calibrated and
controlled to operate correctly.  In a specific embodiment, the serial link block 310 of FIG. 3 can be configured like block 400.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a simplified diagram of a digital processing/signal pre-distortion block according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary
skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown, the digital processing/signal pre-distortion block 500 comprises at least an Error Encoding/Decoding block 510, an Optical Distortion/Electrical Compensation
(EDC) block 520, and a Modulation Conversion block 530.  In an example, it shows the details of a possible implementation of the electronic processing blocks in the transmit and receive paths.  In an alternative embodiment, some of those blocks may be
configured differently in the transmit versus the receive path.  One of the essential blocks is the Error Encoding/Decoding block 510 which performs data error control coding.  As additional data bits are added to blocks of signal data in such a way that
when errors occur they may be correctable in the receive path.  Modern error control codes are sophisticated that they can correct, e.g., up to 1 error in every 100 bits with modest data overhead and latency.  Optical distortion compensation block 520
helps compensate for impairments in the optical and electrical transmission paths.  These could include compensation of, e.g., bandwidth limitations and inter-symbol interference.  The modulation conversion block 530 codes and decodes the multi-level
higher-order modulation signals that are used at the transmitter and receiver, and converts them to the simple two-level NRZ format used in the lower speed interfaces.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a simplified diagram of an electrical laser driver and TIA block diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary
skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown, the top part circuit (A) of an electrical laser driver and TIA block 600 includes an edge rate control circuit 610 coupled to a swing and common mode voltage
adjustable driver 620.  In an implementation, the driver 620 will be used for the modulator and the receiver circuit for a photo diode detector (to be shown in FIG. 7 below).  The electrical output of the top circuit (A) is used to drive the modulator. 
The modulator imprints the electrical signal input on to the optical carrier.  The driver and TIA block 600 can also include a limiting amplifier 630 coupled to a TIA 640, which can be coupled to an input bandwidth control block 650.  The output of the
photo diode detector is the input to the bottom part circuit (B) of the electrical laser driver and TIA block 600.  This circuit converts the current signal from the photo diode detector into a voltage signal which can then be processed by other
circuits.  In an example, the electrical laser driver and TIA block 600 is block 330 included in the electrical silicon die block shown in FIG. 3.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a simplified diagram of a silicon photonic block diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art

modulator 730, control loops 740, and photo diode detectors 750.  In a specific embodiment, the silicon photonic block 700 includes common blocks of an optical sub-system including control loops.  The transmit path of the optical sub-system includes a
laser source 720 which can be selected from a CW (continuous wave) DFB (distributed feedback) laser among others.  The laser source 720 provides the optical carrier.  The output from the laser source 720 is optically coupled into the laser modulator 730. The electrical data is converted to optical via the modulator for modulating the optical signal directly from the laser source 720.  The modulator 730 may be an electro-absorption modulator or a Mach-Zehnder (MZ) modulator, or others depending on
embodiments.  The output signal from the modulator 720 is then coupled to a fiber (not shown) for external transmission.  The receive path of the optical sub-system includes the optical signal from the fiber coupled into one or more photo diode detectors
750.  The photo diode detector 750 converts the optical data into electrical data.  The control loops 740 are needed to correctly bias the laser source 720, the modulator 730, and the one or more photo diode detectors 750.  The bias control signals may
include current or voltage outputs used to setup the laser source, modulator, and the photo diode detector correctly.  The control output signals may also be continually adjusted using the feedback from the devices themselves.

At least a pair of laser devices 1030, 1031 is associated with a channel and coupled to a switch 1050 to select one of the pair of laser devices to be coupled to an optical multiplexer to provide for redundant laser devices 1040, 1041. The worst case is to have 2 times total number of wavelengths with twice in chip size.  In an embodiment, the switch is a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) switch used to switch between a .lamda.1 and a redundant .lamda.1'.  Or it could be a passive
coupler.  In another embodiment, it preserves the size of the wavelength multiplexer so that no additional .lamda.  channels are needed.  Note, the integrated system-on-chip device doesn't have to operate the redundant .lamda.1' until needed, therefore
no power consumption penalty is applied.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 is a simplified diagram illustrating a built-in self test 1100 using an optical loop back according to an embodiment of the present invention.

without the isolation switch there is undesirably direct crosstalk between the output and input as shown.  In an example, about 30 dB isolation is included to prevent coherent crosstalk.  Of course, there can be variations.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 is a simplified diagram illustrating a built-in self test 1200 configured for optical testing according to an embodiment of the present invention.  In an example, the present invention provides an integrated system on chip device having
a built-in self test technique.  As shown are a TX multiplexer 1210 and an RX multiplexer 1220 for a silicon photonics device.  A broad band source 1230 is coupled to each of the multiplexers.  Multiple sources can also be included.  In an example, the

misaligned in an example.  When thermally tuned, techniques can be used to selectively align one of the combs to another comb or spatial reference as shown in graph 1402.  In an example, to maintain alignment, the technique dithers the signal to one of
the rings.  Of course, there can be variations, alternatives, and modifications.
<br/><br/> FIG. 15 is a simplified block diagram of a control interface for a silicon photonics device according to an embodiment of the present invention.  In an example, the control interface is provided to communicate between the control block and the

<br/><br/> FIG. 16 is a simplified diagram illustrating a laser configuration 1600 at a transmitter side of a silicon photonics device according to an embodiment of the present invention.  The silicon photonics device is one associated with the
system-on-chip device illustrated in FIG. 8.  As shown are a plurality of laser devices 1620 arranged in different channels with different wavelengths numbered from wavelength .lamda..sub.1 to .lamda..sub.n, each of which has a modulator device 1640, and
are collectively coupled to a spectral multiplexer 1660.  Each of the laser devices 1620 are coupled to a pair of control blocks, such as blocks 1611 and 1612, and monitor blocks 1630.  The spectral multiplexer 1660 is coupled to a fiber interface 1670. 
Each channel has two laser drivers for controlling optical signals either by DC current or DC and Dither frequency, before the laser active region, a wavelength controller and locker, a modulator device for tuning the laser based on the original
electrical data bits, and are collectively coupled to a spectral multiplexer.  The spectral multiplexer is coupled to a fiber interface for transmitting out a WDM signal representing the original data 1 G, 4 G, 10 G, or 100 G, among others with
multi-rate format.  As shown, alternatively, a broadband source is also included in parallel with the laser configuration at the transmitter side of the silicon photonics device, as previously noted.
<br/><br/> FIG. 17 is a simplified diagram illustrating a laser configuration 1700 at a receiver side of a silicon photonics device according to an embodiment of the present invention.  The silicon photonics device is one associated with the system-on-chip
device illustrated in FIG. 8.  As shown are a plurality of detectors 1710 arranged for each channel with wavelength .lamda..sub.1 to .lamda..sub.n, each of which has a oscillator device 1730, and are collectively coupled to a spectral multiplexer 1750. 
Each of the photodetector blocks 1710 can be coupled to hybrid blocks 1720.  The spectral multiplexer is coupled to a fiber interface 1760.  The spectral multiplexer 1750 is coupled to a fiber interface to receive the incoming WDM signals.  After each
wavelength is demultiplexed, it is mixed in the hybrid block 1720 with a local oscillator signal from the oscillator device 1730 per each channel.  The detector per channel is configured to convert the hybrid optical signals into photocurrent as
electrical signals.  As shown in FIG. 17, a broadband source 1740 is included in parallel, as previously noted.
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 is a simplified diagram illustrating a hybrid light source 1800 for a silicon photonics device according to an embodiment of the present invention.  As shown is a silicon substrate 1810 for photonics devices, and overlying buried oxide
region 1820, and an overlying crystalline silicon material 1830 configured for a waveguide or guides.  Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
<br/><br/> FIG. 19 is a simplified diagram illustrating a wavelength control and locking configuration with a silicon photonic device according to an embodiment of the present invention.  As shown, device 1901 shows a laser device coupled to control
blocks, and a modulator block.  For each wavelength (channel) two control drivers are used.  Driver #2 is driven by a fixed DC bias current setting as described as Input 1512 in FIG. 15.  Driver #1 is driven by the DC bias current combined a frequency
dither signal generated by variable bias block.  The both wavelength control signals are combined to drive operation of the laser active region.  A monitor device follows the laser active region to monitor the laser power and wavelength by providing
feedback signals in terms of current and voltage (e.g., 1523, 1524 in FIG. 15).  The monitor block coupled to the modular and laser device is also coupled in series to a photocurrent detect circuit to TIA with bandwidth 2f-4f block, a minimum detect
circuit to derivative block, and the variable bias setting block.  Only one control signal (e.g., #1) is applied with dither in the monitor device.  A photocurrent detect circuit of the monitor device is coupled to a transimpedance amplifier with
bandwidth of 2-times to 4-times the corresponding signal frequency.  Graph 1902 shows the signal at the monitor #1 block when dither is applied, showing the derivative signal in the bottom graph.  The dither-applied control signal after the photocurrent
detect circuit further is processed by a minimum detect circuit to convert to a derivative signal.  Graph 1903 shows the effect of applying dither to one comb on the wavelengths produced.  This self-test configuration can also be used in the detections
of the odd harmonics.  Accordingly a variable control bias setting is determined and sent back to the laser driver #1.  As the wavelength is controlled and locked by the above feedback control configuration, a modulator is coupled before the output port
to provide signal modulation (in both amplitude and phase) in accordance with original data bits.  Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
<br/><br/> FIG. 20 is a simplified diagram illustrating a wavelength control and locking configuration with a silicon photonics device according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention.  The device of 2001 shows a similar configuration to
device 1901 of FIG. 19.  Graph 2002 shows the signal after the detect circuit when dither is applied to one of the controls.  Graph 2003 shows the application of dither to one comb, similar to graph 1903 of FIG. 19.  This is a method with some difference
added into the transimpedance amplifier for processing the photocurrent detection in the monitor device, wherein the bandwidth of the transimpedance amplifier is still from 2-times (2f) to 4-times (4f) the corresponding signal frequency but a bandpass
filter at 2f and 4f (or at 2kf in principle for k=1, 2, 3, .  . . ) is added, compared to the method mentioned in FIG. 19.  Again, the dither-applied control signal after the photocurrent detect circuit further is processed by a minimum detect circuit to
convert to a reversed derivative signal.  Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 21 A-C are simplified diagrams illustrating a silicon photonics device configured on high speed substrates according to embodiments of the present invention.  FIG. 21A shows device 2101 wherein a high speed ASIC is configured overlying a
first region of a high speed substrate and coupled to one or more first contact pads.  At least one of the first contacts is coupled to one of one or more second contact pads.  Similarly, at least one of the second contacts is coupled to one of one or
more third contact pads.  A high speed probe is shown at the second contacts.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the high speed substrate is designed such that it has a series of traces and via connections to characterize its bandwidth and loss.  The probe pads may be staggered and/or placed at different distances from the ASIC to
characterize the ASIC drive and substrate bandwidth properties.  This test can be done in manufacturing to screen out bad ASIC's before the next die is attached.  Typically, lower cost dies are screened out before expensive ones.  The connections may
also be daisy chained on the substrate to test a number of vias and connections in series to extract the equivalent circuit model for each.
<br/><br/> FIG. 21B shows device 2102 wherein a silicon photonics device is configured overlying a second region of the high speed substrate.  The silicon photonics device is coupled to the one or more second contacts.  The high speed ASIC and the silicon
photonics device are coupled via the first and second contacts.  Here, the high speed probe is shown at the third contacts.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the BIST (built-in self-test) capability in the silicon photonics chip can be used to convert the optical signal to the electrical equivalent and test it on the high speed substrate.  The high speed substrate can also have
resistors, capacitors, etc., for terminations and appropriate electrical loads.  In the normal use case, the signals from the silicon photonics device will terminate in the high speed ASIC completely in the self-test loop.  There are diagnostic cases
where external termination may be provided on the substrate and signal quality is verified.
<br/><br/> FIG. 21C shows device 2103 wherein another high speed ASIC is configured overlying a third region of the high speed substrate.  This second high speed ASIC is coupled to the one or more third contacts.  The second high speed ASIC and the silicon
photonics device are coupled via the second and third contacts.  High speed electrical ASIC and silicon photonics ASIC can be cascaded for testing and characterization.
<br/><br/> While the above is a full description of the specific embodiments, various modifications, alternative constructions and equivalents may be used.  Therefore, the above description and illustrations should not be taken as limiting the scope of the
present invention which is defined by the appended claims.
