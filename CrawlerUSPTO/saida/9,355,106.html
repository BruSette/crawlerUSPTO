       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A method, an apparatus, and a system for locating sensor data. The method
     includes the steps of: obtaining an index table; intercepting a query for
     sensor data in runtime; extracting a characteristic parameter from a
     query condition; locating a block identifier of matching sensor data
     storage blocks in the index table by using the characteristic parameter;
     and loading the storage blocks into a memory space of a working
     processor; where the index table contains mapping relationships between
     block identifiers of sensor data storage blocks and characteristic
     attributes of sensor data.

<br/><br/> This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C.  .sctn.119 from China Patent Application No. 201210147248 filed Apr.  27, 2012 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> 1.  Field of the Invention
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to the processing of sensor data, more particularly, to a sensor data locating method and apparatus.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of Related Art
<br/><br/> In the smart planet scenario (e.g., Intelligent Operation Center (IOC) for city), there are thousands upon thousands of sensor devices distributed around city areas.  The data generated by these sensor devices are gathered into a data center to
support further intelligent analysis.  The sensor data have the following characteristics: the sensor data are natively clustering together temporally and spatially in that, spatially, data of one sensor is the data of the area monitored by the sensor,
and temporally, the sensor generates and stores the sensor data in the order of time; these sensor data are nearly all "written once, read many times"; these data files from thousands upon thousands of sensor devices will be gathered into a uniform big
file, to facilitate management and global query.
<br/><br/> Currently, Hadoop-like technologies (including Hadoop technology and other similar massive data distributed storage technologies) provide high availability and high throughput capacity to realize the storage and processing of massive data;
however, the low latency, especially the low latency caused by low disk I/O bandwidth, is still a problem yet to be solved.  Since the amount of sensor data is too large, they are usually stored in disks of data nodes distributed in various places in the
form of blocks or chunks with certain redundancy.  When a Hadoop-like based intelligent application performs a query, it will load all the data in the source file in the form of blocks from the disks of data nodes to the memory where the working
processor resides.  Then it is determined in the memory which data is related to the request, and which data is irrelevant to the current request, and the irrelevant data is discarded in the memory.  Such an approach will make the disk I/O loads a large
amount of invalid and irrelevant data into the memory, so as to bring extra disk I/O burden.  Moreover, the larger the original file is, the greater the disk I/O burden is.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention provides a method for locating sensor data, including the steps of: obtaining an index table; intercepting a query for sensor data in runtime; extracting a characteristic parameter from a query condition; locating a block
identifier of matching sensor data storage blocks in the index table by using the characteristic parameter; and loading the storage blocks into a memory space of a working processor; where the index table contains mapping relationships between block
identifiers of sensor data storage blocks and characteristic attributes of sensor data.

<br/><br/> Aspects of the present invention are described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention.  It will be understood
that each block of the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions.  These computer program instructions may be

blocks.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 2, a schematic diagram of an architecture of an Intelligent Operation Center for city, in which the method and apparatus of the present invention may be implemented, is shown.  In FIG. 2, massive sensor data files from large
amounts of sensors are stored into disks managed by a file system, such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), etc. The massive sensor data files from large amounts of sensors can be gathered into a uniform big file of the file system like HDFS, and
the big file is stored in a disk managed by the file system.  The disk may be only a logical concept, and the massive sensor data may actually be stored in disks on data nodes distributed in various areas.  That is to say, from the viewpoint of the file
system, it manages the uniform big file stored in the disk, while actually the big file is stored distributedly in disks on various data nodes.  When an intelligent application such as an analysis application performs a query, the Hadoop-like application
in the Intelligent Operation Center (IOC) will first load all the data of the entire uniform big file from the disk to the memory space of the working storage, thus bringing a heavy burden to the disk 10 and increasing the latency of a query response.
<br/><br/> For a HDFS like file system, data organization is based on blocks and data loading is also based on blocks.  For example, the size of each block is generally about 64M, while the size of each big file may be about 300 blocks, i.e.,
64M.times.300=.about.20 G.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3, a schematic diagram of a Hadoop-like architecture, in which the method and apparatus of the present invention may be implemented and the operations thereof, is shown in more detail.  In FIG. 3, a Hadoop-like application is
connected with a name node and a plurality of data nodes via a network.  It also may be connected with one or more Hadoop-like clients (not shown) via a network.  The Hadoop-like application may be located in the Intelligent Operation Center (IOC); of
course, it may also be located in other application scenarios.  The data nodes are usually distributed in different geographical locations, and may be managed by, e.g., a Linux file system.  Data nodes are used for storing massive data, e.g., massive
sensor data, in the disks connected thereto.  Massive data are usually stored in data nodes in the form of blocks, and usually have a set storage redundancy.  That is to say, data of the same file are usually stored in a plurality of blocks, and the
plurality of blocks are distributed in different data nodes, and the data of the same block of the file are usually stored in a set number of data nodes.  The mapping relationships between files, blocks and data nodes are maintained in the name node.  As
shown in FIG. 3, the name node stores the file name space of the Hadoop-like file system, a number of block IDs (e.g., block 2ef0) to which the file names (e.g./foo/bar) in the file name space correspond, and the block position of each block (e.g., block
position 1, block position 2), i.e., the data node where the block resides.
<br/><br/> During the process of reading a Hadoop-like file, as shown in FIG. 3, the Hadoop-like application usually, in response to a query request received from a client, sends the query request including a file name to the name node.  The name node,
according to the files name, looks up each block ID to which the file name corresponds as well as the block positions of each block, and return each block ID and each block positions thereof to the Hadoop-like application.  Thereafter, with respect to
each block, the Hadoop-like application selects the data node closet to the client in the block positions (i.e., data nodes) of the block, and sends a request for the block to the data node.  Then, the data node returns the requested block to the client
according to the request.  In this way, the client may assemble each block of the file received from the respective data nodes into a whole file.
<br/><br/> During the process of writing a Hadoop-like file (not shown), the Hadoop-like application usually, in response to a file writing request received from a client, sends the writing request including the file name to the name node, and applies for
new blocks with the name node.  The name node will assign new blocks for the file, and obtains a list of data nodes storing these blocks, the size of the list being dependent on the redundancy setting, and then returns each block identifier and the
corresponding data node list to the Hadoop-like application.  Then, the Hadoop-like application splits the file into a plurality of parts, and successively sends each part to the respective data nodes, so as to be stored by the data nodes into disks
associated therewith.
<br/><br/> Sensor data from different sensor devices has been found to natively cluster together in data files according to temporal and spatial attributes.  After these data files are gathered into a uniform file, such clustering still remains.  That is
to say, data with the same temporal and spatial attributes are usually stored in the same data files, and are usually stored at adjacent positions in the uniform file, i.e., usually stored in the same one or few blocks (of course, the same one block may
store data with different temporal and spatial attributes).
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 4, the basic idea of the present invention is schematically shown.  In FIG. 4, a file is stored in the form of blocks in block 1, block 2, .  . . block N, which are in the disks managed by HDFS-like file system (i.e., the disks
in the data nodes).  In the prior art, when a query is received, all the blocks of the file are loaded from the disk to the memory space of the working storage managed by Map/Reduce-like.  However, the query includes a spatial and temporal condition, and
the data satisfying the condition actually only exist in block 1 and block 2 (as shown by the shaded parts of block 1 and block 2 in the Figure).  Therefore, only block 1 and block 2 need to be loaded into the memory space of the working storage.  To
this end, in the solution of the present invention, the mapping relationships between block identifiers and characteristics of sensor data, such as temporal and spatial attributes, will be created in advance and a query will be intercepted during the
runtime so as to only load from the disk the blocks containing the sensor data corresponding to the parameters such as time and space in the query condition (as shown in block 1 and block 2 in the FIG. 4).
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 5, a sensor data locating apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown.  In FIG. 5, the apparatus comprises: an Index Table Obtaining Module 501 configured to obtain an index table including the
mapping relationships between block identifiers of sensor data storage blocks and characteristic attributes of sensor data; a Query Intercepting Module 502 configured to, in response to a query to the sensor data in runtime, intercept the query and
extract characteristic parameters in the query condition; and a Block Locating Module 503 configured to use the characteristic parameters to locate the block identifiers of matching sensor data storage blocks in the index table, so as to load the storage
blocks indicated by the located block identifiers into the memory space of a working storage for response to the query.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the characteristic attributes comprise either one or both of a temporal attribute and a spatial attribute, and the characteristic parameters correspondingly comprise either one or both of a
temporal parameter and a spatial parameter.  According to other embodiments of the present invention, the characteristic attributes may also comprise other data attributes than a temporal attribute and a spatial attribute, and the characteristic
parameters may also correspondingly comprise other data characteristic parameters than a temporal parameter and a spatial parameter.  Actually, the characteristic parameters may be any kind of data characteristic parameters that can be extracted from a
query condition, and the characteristic attributes may be any corresponding kind of data characteristic attributes.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment of the present invention, the sensor data are stored on data nodes managed by the Hadoop-like Distributed File System in the form of blocks.  In an embodiment of the present invention, the sensor data are stored in a file of the
Hadoop-like Distributed File System.  This means that, the sensor files from a plurality of sensors are gathered to a file of the Hadoop-like Distributed File System.  Of course, in some other embodiments of the present invention, the sensor data may
also be stored on data nodes managed by other file systems, and the sensor data may also be saved in a file of the other file systems.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the sensor data locating apparatus may further comprise an index table creating module for creating the above-mentioned index table.  Of course, in some other embodiments of the present
invention, the index table creating module may be external to the sensor data locating apparatus, that is, the apparatus does not comprise the index table creating module.  In addition, in some other embodiments of the present invention, the index table
creating module may be combined with the index table obtaining module 501 to be a single module.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the index table creating module may, by scanning data in the blocks stored in the data nodes, create an index table including the mapping relationships between block identifiers and
characteristic attributes of the sensor data stored in the blocks.  According to another embodiment of the present invention, the index table creating module may record the mapping relationships between the characteristic attributes of the sensor data
and the corresponding blocks assigned to the sensor data during the process of writing sensor data into data nodes managed by the Hadoop-like Distributed File System, so as to create and update the index table including the mapping relationships between
the block identifiers of the sensor data storage blocks and the characteristic attributes of the sensor data.  The index table creating module may create the index table after the sensor data files have been gathered to one file and at any time before
beginning to receive and process a query.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the index table creating module may store the created index table on the name node of the Hadoop-like architecture, or in any other places accessible to the name node.
<br/><br/> The following table shows an example of an index table created by the index table creating module:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 Example Index Table Block identifier space Time type .  . . 0021 Xi'erqi China bank 2011 Jan.  22 .  . . 0021 4rd high school 2011 Jan.  22 .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12246 intersection 1101 2011 May 15 .  . . 12247
intersection 1101 2011 May 15 .  . .
<br/><br/> The example index table, Table 1, contains the mapping relationship between the block identifier "00021" and the spatial attribute "4rd high school" and the temporal attribute "2011-01-22", which indicates that in block 00021 are stored sensor
data with the spatial attribute and the temporal attribute.
<br/><br/> After the application issues a query for the sensor data in a file in the disk, the query intercepting module 502 intercepts the query and extracts the characteristic parameters in the query condition.  Thereafter, the block locating module 503
uses the extracted characteristic parameters to locate the corresponding block identifier in the index table, so as to load the block to the memory space of the working storage for response to the query.  For example, an example query condition in the
example query intercepted by the query intercepting module 502 is "location=`4rd high school` and time=2011-01-22' and .  . . ", and the example query condition includes the example spatial parameter "4rd high school" and the example temporal parameter
"2011-01-22", thus the block locating module 503 may use the example spatial parameter and the example temporal parameter to locate the example block identifier 00021 in the above example index table, so as to load the block to the memory space of the
working storage for response to the query.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the index table further comprises the relationships between the block identifiers of the sensor data and other attributes of the sensor data.  For example, the above example index table
further comprises the mapping relationships between the block identifiers and the types of the sensor data.  And in this a case, after the query intercepting module 502 intercepts the query, it may extract the characteristic parameters and other
corresponding parameters, e.g., type, in the query condition and then the block locating module 503 may use the extracted characteristic parameters and the other parameters to locate the corresponding block identifiers in the index table, so as to load
the block to the memory space of the working storage.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the sensor data locating apparatus is realized on the name node of a Hadoop-like architecture, so as to realize a seamless integration of the apparatus with the Hadoop-like architecture.  This
means that, the index table obtaining module 501, the query intercepting module 502, the block locating module 503 and the index table creating module are all on the name node of the Hadoop-like architecture, and the index table created by the index
table creating module is also on the name node.  Thus, the present invention only needs to change the name node in the existing Hadoop-like architecture, and does not need to change the remaining parts of the existing Hadoop-like architecture.  Before a
Hadoop-like application receives and processes a query from a client, the index table creating module of the present invention will first create an index table including the mapping relationships between the block identifiers and the characteristic
attributes of sensor data stored in the blocks.  When the Hadoop-like application receives a query from a client, as in the prior art, the Hadoop-like application sends the query to the name node.  When the name node receives the query from the
Hadoop-like application, the query intercepting module 502 of the present invention intercepts the query, and extracts the characteristic parameters about the sensor data in the query condition.  Next, the block locating module 503 of the present
invention uses the characteristic parameters to locate the corresponding block identifiers in the index table, and provides each located block identifier to the name node (i.e., a corresponding existing processing module therein).  Then, as in the prior
art, the name node obtains a set of block positions (i.e., data nodes) to which each block identifier corresponds, and returns each block identifier and the set of block positions corresponding thereto to the Hadoop-like application, so that the Hadoop
application or its client may determine the proper data nodes according to the block positions, and loads the data in the blocks from the data nodes to the memory space of the working processor for response to the query.  Thus it can be seen that in this
way a seamless integration of the data locating apparatus of the present invention and the Hadoop-like architecture is realized, which facilitates the implementation of apparatus of the present invention.
<br/><br/> In other embodiments of the present invention, the sensor data locating apparatus may also be realized outside the name node, and cooperate with the Hadoop-like architecture in other ways, so as to realize the objectives of the present
invention.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments of the present invention, the apparatus further comprises a query execution module configured to execute a query against the blocks loaded into the memory space of the working storage and return the query result. 
The query execution module may be a query processing module in the existing Hadoop-like architecture or in other architectures.  Of course, in some other embodiments of the present invention, the apparatus may also not include the query execution module.
<br/><br/> The sensor data locating apparatus is described above according to the embodiments of the present invention and by referring to the accompanying drawings.  It should be pointed out that the apparatus is only exemplary, rather than limitation to
the present invention.  In other embodiments of the present invention, the apparatus may comprise more, less or different modules, and the relationships of connection, containment, function, etc. among the modules may be different from described or
illustrated.  For example, it may also be contemplated to include the index table into the apparatus; still for example, the modules may be split and combined in any manners, as long as the functions executed by these modules are maintained.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 6, a sensor data locating method according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown.  The method comprises steps 601, 602, and 603 as shown in FIG. 6.
<br/><br/> At step 601, obtain an index table including the mapping relationships between block identifiers of sensor data storage blocks and characteristic attributes of sensor data.
<br/><br/> At step 602, in response to a query to the sensor data in runtime, intercept the query and extract the characteristic parameters in the query condition.
<br/><br/> At step 603, use the characteristic parameters to locate the block identifiers of matching sensor data storage block in the index table, so as to load the storage blocks indicated by the located block identifiers to the memory space of a working
storage for response to the query.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the characteristic attributes includes either one or both of a temporal attribute and a spatial attribute, and the characteristic parameters correspondingly includes either one or both of a
temporal parameter and a spatial parameter.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the sensor data are stored on data nodes managed by a Hadoop-like Distributed File System in the form of blocks.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the sensor data are stored in a file of the Hadoop-like Distributed File System.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the method further comprises a step of creating the index table.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, creating the index table is realized by scanning the data stored in blocks on data nodes managed by the Hadoop-like Distributed File System.
<br/><br/> According to the embodiments of the present invention, creating the index table is realized in the process of writing sensor data into data nodes managed by the Hadoop-like Distributed File System.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the index table is stored in the name node in the Hadoop architecture.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the index table further comprises the relationship between the block identifiers of the sensor data storage blocks and other attributes of the sensor data.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the method is realized on the name node of the Hadoop-like architecture, so as to realize a seamless integration of the method and the Hadoop-like architecture.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the method further comprises the following steps: execute the query against the blocks loaded into the memory space of the working storage and return the query result.
<br/><br/> The sensor data locating method is described above according to embodiments of the present invention and by referring to the accompanying drawings.  It should be pointed out that the method may include more, less or different steps, and the
relationships of connection, inclusion, function, etc. among the steps may be different from described or illustrated.  For example, the steps may be split or combined in any manners, as long as the operations executed in these steps are maintained.
