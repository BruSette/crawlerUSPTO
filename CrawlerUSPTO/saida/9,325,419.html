</font><br/>
       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> Method and devices of controlling wavelengths in two-channel DEMUX/MUX in
     silicon photonics are provided. The two-channel DEMUX/MUX includes a
     waveguide-based delay-line-interferometer at least in receiver portion of
     a two-channel transceiver for DWDM optical transmission loop and is
     configured to split a light wave with combined two-wavelengths into one
     light wave with locked one channel wavelength and another light wave with
     locked another channel wavelength. The waveguide-based delayed-line
     interferometer (DLI) is characterized by a free-spectral-range configured
     to be equal to twice of channel spacing. The method includes tuning
     heater of DLI in receiver of each two-channel transceiver by using either
     low-frequency dither signals added on MZMs associated with respective two
     channels as feedback signal or one DFB laser wavelength tapped from an
     input of transmitter portion at one channel before or after the MZMs as a
     direct wavelength reference to feed into an output of receiver portion at
     another channel.

<br/><br/> The present invention relates to optical telecommunication techniques.  More particularly, the present invention provides DEMUX/MUX configurations of 2-channel silicon photonic devices for wavelength control and methods thereof.
<br/><br/> Over the last few decades, the use of communication networks exploded.  In the early days of Internet, popular applications were limited to emails, bulletin board, and mostly informational and text-based web page surfing, and the amount of data
transferred was usually relatively small.  Today, Internet and mobile applications demand a huge amount of bandwidth for transferring photo, video, music, and other multimedia files.  For example, a social network like <b><i>Facebook</i></b> processes more than 500 TB
of data daily.  With such high demands on data and data transfer, existing data communication systems need to be improved to address these needs.
<br/><br/> Progress in computer technology (and the continuation of Moore's Law) is becoming increasingly dependent on faster data transfer between and within microchips.  Optical interconnects may provide a way forward, and silicon photonics may prove
particularly useful, once integrated on the standard silicon chips.  40-Gbit/s and then 100-Gbit/s data rates WDM optical transmission over existing single-mode fiber is a target for the next generation of fiber-optic communication networks.  The big
hangup so far has been the fiber impairments like chromatic dispersion that are slowing the communication signal down.  Everything is okay up to 10 Gbits/s plus a little, but beyond that, distortion and attenuation take their toll.  Many approaches are
proposed on modulation methods for transmitting two or more bits per symbol so that higher communication rates can be achieved.  Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZM) can handle the higher data rates but require a driver that is differential with a wide output
voltage swing.  Beyond the light modulation for data transmission, the MUX/DEMUX of light signals is an essential building block for the optical network based on silicon photonics.
<br/><br/> Silicon photonic devices can be made using existing semiconductor fabrication techniques, and because silicon is already used as the substrate for most integrated circuits, it is possible to create hybrid devices in which the optical and
electronic components are integrated onto a single microchip.  In particular, silicon photonic devices have been applied in dense-wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) optical transmission networks, in which DEMUX/MUX of light signals require precise
wavelength targeting and control over environment temperature change.  Therefore, improved wavelength control techniques and methods are desired.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to optical telecommunication techniques.  More particularly, the present invention provides a two-channel DUMUX/MUX device for waveguide-based wavelength control in silicon photonics.  Merely by examples, the
present invention discloses several DEMUX/MUX configurations of 2-channel silicon photonic devices for optical transmission and reception with wavelength control function integrated in a single waveguide chip for high data rate WDM optical
communications, though other applications are possible.
<br/><br/> In modern electrical interconnect systems, high-speed serial links have replaced parallel data buses, and serial link speed is rapidly increasing due to the evolution of CMOS technology.  Internet bandwidth doubles almost every two years
following Moore's Law.  But Moore's Law is coming to an end in the next decade.  Standard CMOS silicon transistors will stop scaling around 5 nm.  And the internet bandwidth increasing due to process scaling will plateau.  But Internet and mobile
applications continuously demand a huge amount of bandwidth for transferring photo, video, music, and other multimedia files.  This disclosure describes techniques and methods to improve the communication bandwidth beyond Moore's law.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the present invention provides a two-channel silicon photonic transceiver with wavelength control for DEMUX/MUX in DWDM applications.  The two-channel silicon photonic transceiver includes a transmitter comprising a first
optical input port and a second optical input port.  The transmitter further includes a first modulator and a second modulator respectively coupled to the first optical input port and the second optical input port for modulating a first optical signal at
a first wavelength and a second optical signal at a second wavelength.  Additionally, the transmitter includes a 2.times.1 WDM combiner coupled to the first modulator and the second modulator to transmit a first transmission signal combined with the
first wavelength and the second wavelength to a first optical output port.  Additionally, the two-channel transceiver includes a receiver comprising a third optical input port, a second optical output port, a third optical output port, and a two-channel
delay-line interferometer coupled between the third optical input port and second and third optical output ports.  The third optical input port is configured to receive a second transmission signal combined with the first wavelength and the second
wavelength.  The second transmission signal is substantially similar to the first transmission signal.  The delayed-line interferometer in the receiver is configured to split the second transmission signal to a third optical signal locked at the first
wavelength to the second optical output port substantially free of element of the second wavelength and a fourth optical signal locked at the second wavelength to the third optical output port substantially free of element of the first wavelength.
<br/><br/> In an alternative embodiment, the present invention provides a method of locking channel wavelengths through two-channel DEMUX/MUX in DWDM applications.  The method includes disposing a first two-channel transceiver at a first terminal of a DWDM
communication loop and a second two-channel transceiver at a second terminal of the DWDM communication loop.  Each of the first and the second two-channel transceiver includes a transmitter having a first/second optical input port coupled with a
first/second modulator and a 2.times.1 WDM combiner coupled to a first optical output port and a receiver comprising a third optical input port connected to a two-channel delay-line interferometer including a heater with a second/third optical output

wave with a first/second wavelength at the first/second modulator to generate a first/second optical signal characterized by the first/second wavelength and combining the first optical signal with the second optical signal to a first transmission signal
outputted through the first optical output port to a first optical fiber.  The method further includes inserting a first/second dither signal to the first/second modulator.  The first/second dither signal is carried by the first transmission signal. 
Furthermore, the method includes receiving the first transmission signal including the first/second dither signal from the first optical fiber by the third optical input port of the receiver of the second two-channel transceiver.  The method further
includes setting the two-channel delay-line interferometer in the receiver with a free-spectral range equal to twice of channel spacing between the first wavelength and the second wavelength for splitting the first transmission signal into a third
optical signal including the first dither signal into the second optical output port and a fourth optical signal including the second dither signal into the third optical output port.  Moreover, the method includes detecting the first/second ditcher
signal at the second/third output port of the receiver of the second two-channel transceiver by a photodiode to obtain a first/second electrical signal and tuning the heater of the two-channel delay-line interferometer via a feedback circuit for
maximizing the first/second electrical signal, thereby controlling the third/fourth optical signal at the second/third optical output port to be substantially free from element of the second/first wavelength.
<br/><br/> In yet another alternative embodiment, the present invention provides a method of locking channel wavelengths through two-channel DEMUX/MUX in DWDM applications.  The method includes disposing a first two-channel transceiver at a first terminal
of a DWDM communication loop and a second two-channel transceiver at a second terminal of the DWDM communication loop.  Each of the first and the second two-channel transceiver includes a transmitter having a first/second optical input port coupled with
a first/second modulator and a 2.times.1 WDM combiner coupled to a first optical output port and a receiver comprising a third optical input port connected to a two-channel delay-line interferometer including a heater with a second/third optical output

the second/third optical output port of the receiver of the first two-channel transceiver as a reference signal.  Additionally, the method includes modulating the first/second DFB laser light wave with a first/second wavelength at the first/second
modulator to generate a first/second optical signal characterized by the first/second wavelength and combining the first optical signal with the second optical signal to a first transmission signal outputted through the first optical output port to a
first optical fiber.  The method further includes receiving the first transmission signal by the second two-channel transceiver and sending a second transmission signal to a second optical fiber, the second transmission signal being characterized by the
first wavelength and the second wavelength.  The method also includes receiving the second transmission signal from the second optical fiber by the receiver of the first two-channel transceiver and setting the two-channel delay-line interferometer in the
receiver with a free-spectral range equal to twice of channel spacing between the first wavelength and the second wavelength for splitting the second transmission signal into a third optical signal into the second optical output port and a fourth optical
signal into the third optical output port.  Furthermore, the method includes detecting the reference signal by a photodiode next to the third optical input port of the receiver of the first two-channel transceiver to obtain an electrical signal. 
Moreover, the method includes tuning the heater of the two-channel delay-line interferometer via a feedback circuit for maximizing the electrical signal, thereby controlling the third/fourth optical signal at the second/third optical output port to be

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to optical telecommunication techniques.  More particularly, the present invention provides a two-channel DUMUX/MUX device for waveguide-based wavelength control in silicon photonics.  Merely by examples, the
present invention discloses several DEMUX/MUX configurations of 2-channel silicon photonic devices for optical transmission and reception with wavelength control function integrated in a single waveguide chip for high data rate WDM optical
communications, though other applications are possible.
<br/><br/> In the last decades, with advent of cloud computing and data center, the needs for network servers have evolved.  For example, the three-level configuration that have been used for a long time is no longer adequate or suitable, as distributed
applications require flatter network architectures, where server virtualization that allows servers to operate in parallel.  For example, multiple servers can be used together to perform a requested task.  For multiple servers to work in parallel, it is
often imperative for them to be share large amount of information among themselves quickly, as opposed to having data going back forth through multiple layers of network architecture (e.g., network switches, etc.).
<br/><br/> Leaf-spine type of network architecture is provided to better allow servers to work in parallel and move data quickly among servers, offering high bandwidth and low latencies.  Typically, a leaf-spine network architecture uses a top-of-rack
switch that can directly access into server nodes and links back to a set of non-blocking spine switches that have enough bandwidth to allow for clusters of servers to be linked to one another and share large amount of data.
<br/><br/> In a typical leaf-spine network today, gigabits of data are shared among servers.  In certain network architectures, network servers on the same level have certain peer links for data sharing.  Unfortunately, the bandwidth for this type of set
up is often inadequate.  It is to be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention utilizes PAM (e.g., PAM4, PAM8, PAM12, PAM16, etc.) in leaf-spine architecture that allows large amount (up terabytes of data at the spine level) of data to be
transferred via optical network.

<br/><br/> FIG. 1A is a simplified diagram of a two-channel transceiver including a 3 dB combiner as MUX and a waveguide-based delay-line-interferometer as DEMUX according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which
should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown, the two-channel WDM transceiver 100 includes a two-channel transmitter having two optical
inputs, 101 and 102, each receiving a laser light from a corresponding DFB laser source with a predetermined wavelength, .lamda.1 or .lamda.2.  Each laser light is modulated by a MZM modulator, 112 or 113, to generate an optical signal bearing the
corresponding wavelength, .lamda.1 or .lamda.2.  The two-channel transmitter further includes a 3 dB power combiner 110 as a MUX device to combine the two optical signals into one optical output 115.  The MUX 110 can be either a MMI combiner or DC
combiner.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the two-channel WDM transceiver 100 includes a two-channel receiver having an optical input 125 configured to receive one or more wavelength signals into a waveguide-based delay-line-interferometer (DLI) 120.  For example, a
two-wavelength (.lamda.1 and .lamda.2) combined signal is received at the optical input 125 of an 1.times.2 splitter before entering the DLI 120.  The DLI 120 is configured to have one path chosen to be longer than another path by a specific length so
that its free spectral range is equal to twice of channel spacing of the two wavelengths (.lamda.1 and .lamda.2).  The longer path also includes a resistive heater for wavelength control adjustment.  Therefore, the DLI 120 acts as a deinterleaver or a
DEMUX device which is able to split the signal from the input 125 with combined two wavelengths into two signals respectively output to two optical outputs, 121 and 122, each carrying a signal with a single wavelength.  For example, output 121 carries
.lamda.1 at channel 1 (CH1) and output 122 carries .lamda.2 at channel 2 (CH2), each being independently detected by a photodiode.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, a photodiode can also be coupled next to the optical input 125 of the DLI 120 for measuring any reflected signal.  The DLI 120 in the receiver needs to be tuned so that light with wavelength .lamda.1 goes to CH1 PD and light
with wavelength .lamda.2 goes to CH2 PD.  This can be done by using the DFB laser light wavelength as a wavelength reference.  In a specific embodiment, a small portion (typically 2-10%) of CH2 DFB (or CH1 DFB can be used alternatively) is tapped and fed
into the receiver DLI 120 via a reverse CH1 path from output 121 (or CH2 path from output 122 can be used alternatively).  Then the heater on the DLI 120 is tuned so the power at PD coupled next to the optical input 125 is maximized.  In such a way, the
DLI 120 is tuned to provide a free spectral range equal to the channel spacing between .lamda.1 and .lamda.2 so that the resulted interference spectral gives desired interleaving wavelengths respectively into CH1 output 121 and CH2 output 122.  More
description about the DLI tuning will be found in subsequent sections of the specification.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1B is a simplified diagram of a two-channel transceiver including a waveguide-based delay-line-interferometer with free-spectral-range equal to twice of channel spacing as either DUMUX or MUX according to an embodiment of the present
invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown, the two-channel WDM transceiver 100B is
substantially the same as the two-channel WDM transceiver 100 except that the MMI combiner 110 in the transmitter is replaced by a waveguide-based DLI 120A while in the receiver a substantially the same waveguide-based DLI 120B is retained therein. 
Other configurations and wavelength control schemes are the same as those described above.  Each of the two DLIs, 120A and 120B, contains a resistive heater configured for wavelength control by adjusting interference spectrum so that the free spectral
range is equal to the channel spacing between .lamda.1 and .lamda.2.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a simplified diagram of a two-channel waveguide-based delay-line-interferometer with free-spectral-range equal to twice of channel spacing according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which
should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown, the two-channel waveguide-based delay-line-interferometer 200 includes at least one input 201
receiving a light wave with two wavelengths .lamda.1 and .lamda.2, a 1.times.2 power splitter 224 to split the light wave received from the input 201 to two paths 221 and 222, a 2.times.2 coupler 225 coupled between the two paths 221, 222 and two outputs
231, 232.  The two paths 221 and 222 are silicon-based waveguide built on a single-chip SOI substrate.  Particularly, one waveguide path, e.g., 221, is designed to be longer than another waveguide path 222 to give a delayed phase for path 221.  Each
path, either 221 or 222, still carries light signal with both wavelengths .lamda.1 and .lamda.2.  When the two paths are merged at the 2.times.2 coupler 225 the light signal with delayed phase in path 221 and wavelength .lamda.1 (or .lamda.2) interferes
with the light signal in path 222 with the same wavelength .lamda.1 (or .lamda.2) to generate two transmission interference spectrums separated due to wavelength difference between .lamda.1 and .lamda.2 as well as delayed phase caused by length
difference between the two paths 221 and 222.
<br/><br/> In a specific embodiment, the two-channel waveguide-based delay-line-interferometer (DLI) 200 includes a resistive heater 210 disposed to one, usually the longer one, path 221, to provide a tuning mechanism for the delayed phase by changing
temperature to cause refractive index change through the corresponding waveguide.  In an embodiment, for each output 231 or 232 the DLI 200 acts as a filter allowing a light wave with only one wavelength (either .lamda.1 or .lamda.2) to partially pass
out.  In addition to the extra length in path 221, the temperature change provided by the heater 210 is able to further add delayed phase for the path 221 relative to the path 222.  As a result, the output transmission interference spectrum (ouput1) of
the light wave with two wavelengths .lamda.1 and .lamda.2 at output 231 versus the output transmission interference spectrum (ouput2) at output 232 will move left or right along the wavelength axis depending on the heater power.
<br/><br/> Each of the transmission interference spectrums produced by the DLI 200 is characterized by a plurality of passbands respectively distributed around .lamda.1 (or .lamda.2) at a first harmonic peak and periodically around a plurality of higher
harmonic peaks.  The peak-peak spacing is defined as a free-spectral-range (FSR).  For the light wave with two wavelengths .lamda.1 and .lamda.2 in the present case, in a specific embodiment, FSR is tuned to be equal to twice of the difference between
.lamda.1 and .lamda.2.  In such a manner, the DLI 200 filter acts exactly as a deinterleaver that split the light wave with two wavelengths into two separate light waves each with one wavelength.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a simplified diagram of a pair of two-channel transceivers using tones for wavelength controlled transmission according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the
scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown, the pair of two-channel transceivers (Transceiver 1 and Transceiver 2) is respectively disposed at transmitting and
receiving ends as MUX and DEMUX of a two-way traffic optical communication loop including wavelength control.  For example in the transmission path of the optical communication loop, Transceiver 1 is configured to use two DFB laser sources with light
wavelength at .lamda.1 and .lamda.2 being respectively modulated on two MZMs to form two optical signals before being combined into one output for transmitting through optical fiber.  In an embodiment, the DFB laser wavelengths .lamda.1 and .lamda.2 are
selected to be two neighboring channels of ITU grid with a channel spacing of 100 GHz, or 50 GHz, or 25 GHz, or others.  The Transceiver 1 can be the two-channel transceiver 100 described in FIG. 1A.  Alternatively, the Transceiver 1 can be the
two-channel transceiver 100B with the waveguide-based DLI as a 2.times.1 combiner in FIG. 1B.  Further, Transceiver 2 disposed at the receiving end includes the waveguide-based DLI as a 1.times.2 splitter (a deinterleaver) at least at the receiving
portion.
<br/><br/> In a specific embodiment, two low-frequency dither signals (tones) f1 and f2 are added on respective two MZMs for controlling quadrature transfer curve for modulating and locking the wavelength .lamda.1 or .lamda.2 of transmitted light wave in
corresponding CH1 or CH2 output.  The tones f1 and f2 are carried with the light wave signals through optical fiber and received by the Transceiver 2.  The waveguide-based DLI in Transceiver 2 is tuned to have a FSR equal to twice of the wavelength
difference .lamda.1-.lamda.2 to split the light wave into two interleaved parts and deliver a first light wave with .lamda.1 and tone f1 to CH1 output and a second light wave with .lamda.2 and tone f2 to CH2 output.  At the CH1 output a photodiode (PD)
is used to detect (a taped portion of) the light wave signal with wavelength .lamda.1 as well as to detect the tone f1.  Similarly, another PD is also used at CH2 to detect (a tapped portion of) both signal .lamda.2 and tone f2.  Tone f1 (f2) as detected
by the PD is converted to an electrical signal.  The Transceiver 2 further includes a feedback circuit 150 coupled between the PDs and the heater of DLI in the receiver portion of Transceiver 2 and configured to use the converted electrical signal based
on f1 (f2) tone as a control signal to tune interference spectrums of the light wave with two wavelengths passing through the DLI (see description for FIG. 2).  As the result, the f1 (f2) component at the CH1 (CH2) output is tuned be maximized so that
the corresponding transmitted light wave at CH1 (CH2) output can be locked to its pre-select wavelength .lamda.1 (.lamda.2), e.g., at a specific wavelength of ITU grid with least interference from the other wavelength .lamda.2 (.lamda.1).  Alternatively,
by maintaining a stable power ratio between two electrical signals detected by two PDs in CH1 and CH2, the figure of merit of the modulation and wavelength control of two-channel DEMUX/MUX can be obtained.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a simplified diagram of a pair of two-channel transceivers using tapped DFB signal for wavelength controlled transmission according to another embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should not
unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown, the pair of two-channel transceivers (Transceiver 1 and Transceiver 2) is respectively disposed at
transmitting and receiving ends as MUX and DEMUX of a two-way traffic optical communication loop including wavelength control.  In the transmission path of the optical communication loop, Transceiver 1 is configured to use two DFB laser sources with
light wavelength at .lamda.1 and .lamda.2 being respectively modulated on two MZMs to form two optical signals before being combined into one output for transmitting through optical fiber.  In an embodiment, the DFB laser wavelengths .lamda.1 and
.lamda.2 are selected to be two neighboring channels of ITU grid with a channel spacing of 100 GHz, or 50 GHz, or 25 GHz, or others.  The Transceiver 1 can be the two-channel transceiver 100 described in FIG. 1A.  Alternatively, the Transceiver 1 can be
the two-channel transceiver 100B with the waveguide-based DLI as a 2.times.1 combiner in FIG. 1B.  Further, Transceiver 2 disposed at the receiving end includes the waveguide-based DLI as a 1.times.2 splitter (a deinterleaver) at least at the receiving
portion.
<br/><br/> The DLI in receiver portion of each Transceiver needs to be tuned so that .lamda.1 goes to CH1 PD and .lamda.2 goes to CH2 PD to maintain good wavelength control during optical signal transmission and receiving.  In a specific embodiment, the
wavelength control can be done by using the DFB laser wavelength (presumably been locked at certain ITU grid) as a wavelength reference.  Particularly, the Transceiver 1 includes a first power tap device 116 coupled to, e.g., CH2 (or CH1) input that
receives light wave with wavelength .lamda.2 (or .lamda.1), to draw a small portion (2-10%) of light wave .lamda.2 (or .lamda.1) component from CH2 DFB (or CH1 DFB) laser source.  This .lamda.2 (or .lamda.1) component is fed (in a reverse direction) via
a second power tap device 126 into CH1 (CH2) output path of the DLI 120 in the receiver portion of the Transceiver 1.  After this tapped .lamda.2 (or .lamda.1) component passes through the DLI 120 and is detected by a photodiode (PDr) disposed next to
the common input of the DLI 120, this .lamda.2 (or .lamda.1) component as a wavelength reference is converted to an electrical signal.  The Transceiver 1 further includes a feedback circuit 160 to feed this electrical signal back to the heater of the
same DLI 120 of the Transceiver 1 for tuning corresponding interference spectrums of the light wave (from return trip of the communication loop) with both wavelengths .lamda.1 and .lamda.2 so that the heater on the DLI 120 is tuned.  In an embodiment,
the heater power of the DLI 120 is tuned to have the .lamda.2 (or .lamda.1) power at PDr is maximized.  As the result, the DLI 120 is set to make the light wave with locked .lamda.1 goes to CH1 PD and the light wave with locked .lamda.2 goes to CH2 PD as
desired.  Here the light waves belong to signals of the return trip of the communication loop.
<br/><br/> In an alternative embodiment, the above wavelength control scheme using power tap from input DFB light component as wavelength reference can be also implemented to tune DLI in the Transceiver 2 in substantially similar fashion.  As the result,
the light wave in forward trip of the communication loop is also able to be well controlled to make the light wave with locked .lamda.1 goes to CH1 PD and the light wave with locked .lamda.2 goes to CH2 PD as desired.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a simplified diagram of a pair of two-channel transceivers using tapped DFB signal after MZM including tones for wavelength controlled transmission according to yet another embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely
an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown, the pair of two-channel transceivers (Transceiver 1 and Transceiver 2) is
respectively disposed at transmitting and receiving ends as MUX and DEMUX of a two-way traffic optical communication loop including wavelength control.  In the transmission path of the optical communication loop, Transceiver 1 is configured to use two
DFB laser sources with light wavelength at .lamda.1 and .lamda.2 being respectively modulated on two MZMs to form two optical signals before being combined into one output for transmitting through optical fiber.  In an embodiment, the DFB laser
wavelengths .lamda.1 and .lamda.2 are selected to be two neighboring channels of ITU grid with a channel spacing of 100 GHz, or 50 GHz, or 25 GHz, or others.  The Transceiver 1 can be the two-channel transceiver 100 described in FIG. 1A.  Alternatively,
the Transceiver 1 can be the two-channel transceiver 100B with the waveguide-based DLI as a 2.times.1 combiner in FIG. 1B.  Further, Transceiver 2 disposed at the receiving end includes the waveguide-based DLI as a 1.times.2 splitter (a deinterleaver) at
least at the receiving portion.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the tone (or dither) signal f1 or f2 is used to control the heater on the receiver DLI 120 in Transceiver 1.  A small portion (typically 2-10%) of CH2 (or CH1) signal .lamda.2 (or .lamda.1) with tone f2 (or f1) is tapped via a
first power tap device 117 disposed after the MZM and fed via a second power tap device 127 into the receiver DLI 120 from CH1 PD paths (or CH2 PD path).  After this tapped .lamda.2 (or .lamda.1) component passes through the DLI 120 and is detected by a
photodiode (PDr) disposed next to the common input of the DLI 120, this .lamda.2 (or .lamda.1) component as a wavelength reference is converted to an electrical signal.  The Transceiver 1 further includes a feedback circuit 170 to feed this electrical
signal back to the heater of the same DLI 120 of the Transceiver 1 for tuning corresponding interference spectrums of the light wave (from return trip of the communication loop) with both wavelengths .lamda.1 and .lamda.2 so that the heater on the DLI
120 is tuned.  In an embodiment, the heater power of the DLI 120 is tuned to have the .lamda.2 (or .lamda.1) power at PDr is maximized.  Here the light waves belong to signals of the return trip of the communication loop.  In another embodiment, the
heater on the DLI 120 is tuned so that a second harmonic of the tone frequency 2f2 (or 2f1) is maximized.  As the result, the DLI 120 is set to make the light wave with locked .lamda.1 goes to CH1 PD and the light wave with locked .lamda.2 goes to CH2 PD
as desired.
<br/><br/> In an alternative embodiment, the above wavelength control scheme using power tap from input DFB light component as wavelength reference can be also implemented to tune DLI in the Transceiver 2 in substantially similar fashion.  As the result,
the light wave in forward trip of the communication loop is also able to be well controlled to make the light wave with locked .lamda.1 goes to CH1 PD and the light wave with locked .lamda.2 goes to CH2 PD as desired.
<br/><br/> While the above is a full description of the specific embodiments, various modifications, alternative constructions and equivalents may be used.  Therefore, the above description and illustrations should not be taken as limiting the scope of the
present invention which is defined by the appended claims.
