       <p> Social media may be utilized to facilitate distribution of emergency
     alert messages. An emergency alert server may receive an indication of
     emergency and generate an emergency alert message based on the
     indication. The emergency alert message may then be distributed via
     social media and/or other mediums. An indication of trustworthiness may
     be incorporated in the emergency alert message. The indication of
     trustworthiness may be validated by validation system.

FIELD
<br/><br/> The technical field generally relates to public safety, and more specifically relates to managing, distributing, and validating emergency alert messages via social media.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> The wireless Emergency Alert System (EAS) is capable of providing messages indicative of a variety of types of alerts.  Via the EAS, subscribers thereof can receive messages pertaining to weather conditions, disasters, AMBER (America's Missing:
Broadcast Emergency Response) alerts, and/or alerts issued by the Government, for example.  To receive EAS messages, typically, a subscriber registers with a communications network via a mobile switching center (MSC).  An MSC performs functions such as
registration, authentication, location updating, handovers, and call routing.  One MSC can support multiple cellular sites.  Cellular sites can provide EAS messages on different channels.  Unfortunately, if a subscriber of EAS alert messages is not
paying attention to a communications mode, such as email or SMS, sending the subscriber an emergency alert via one of those communications modes may go unnoticed by the person.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> Aspects of the instant disclosure are described more fully herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which example embodiments are shown.  In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set
forth in order to provide an understanding of the various embodiments.  However, the instant disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the example embodiments set forth herein.  Like numbers refer to
like elements throughout.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example system and process for generating and managing emergency alert messages.  As shown, the system of FIG. 1 may comprise all or any appropriate combination of a mobile device 12, a social media server 16, a validation
server 28, an emergency alert server 14 and entity 27 of an emergency alert network.
<br/><br/> As depicted in FIG. 1, an emergency alert server 14 may receive an indication of an emergency from an entity 27.  Emergency alert server 14 may comprise any appropriate entity (e.g., a processor, a server, a computer, or the like) as described
in more detail herein.  The entity 27 may comprise any appropriate entity capable of providing an indication of an emergency (e.g., government agency, individual, social medium, emergency responder, network, etc.).  Based on the indication of the
emergency, the emergency alert server 14 may generate an emergency alert message.  Upon generating the emergency alert message, emergency alert server 14 may distribute the emergency alert message.  Emergency alert server 14 may distribute the emergency
alert message via any appropriate medium.  For example, emergency alert server 14 may provide the emergency alert message via a broadcast, video, email, SMS, social media, or the like, or any appropriate combination thereof.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, the emergency alert message may incorporate an indication of trustworthiness.  For example, the indication of trustworthiness could be an identifier or a token that is embedded in the message.  The identifier, for
example, could be associated with the user that distributed the message.  For example, entity 27 such as the public safety organization could have an identifier associated with its organization.  When the public safety organization posts an emergency
alert message, the message will embed the identifier in the message.  If a mobile device 12 posts an emergency alert message on the social media server 16, an identifier may also be associated with the mobile device 12 user.  In an example embodiment,
the identifier may be transparent to the mobile device user 12, a recipient of the emergency alert message.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, the emergency alert server 14 may distribute the emergency alert message via the social media server 16.  For example, social media server may broadcast emergency alert messages to provide mobile devices 12 with
information about an emergency.  An emergency responder, for example, may receive information about an emergency via multiple social media server 16 (Twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> etc.).  In order to know where to send information, in an example embodiment, Public
Safety agencies 27 may create social network sites in advance (e.g., <b><i>Facebook</i></b> page, Twitter site).  The entity 27 such as the public safety organization may also advertise their social media locations via radio, TV, on emergency vehicles, etc. The
advertisement campaign by entity 27 such as the public safety organization may enable the public to recognize bogus sites from the real Public Safety sites.  The mobile user 12 such as an emergency responder, or more specifically equipment of the
emergency responder, may correlate the information posted on the social media server 16 to provide an accurate description of the emergency, such as track of a storm, tornado, gas plume, etc.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, the emergency alert server 14 may also generate emergency alert messages based on information obtained from a plurality of social media sources.  For example, the emergency alert server 14 may be correlated emergency
messages from the social media server 16.  If there are a lot of messages on the social media sever 16 indicating an emergency, the emergency alert server 14 can generate an emergency alert based on the plurality of message.  For example, if the
emergency alert server 14 correlates emergency information from authenticated sources in social media, the emergency alert server 14 may generate an emergency alert message based on this information.  In another example, if the emergency alert server 14
analyzes emergency messages posted by a plurality mobile device 12 users from the same location, this may indicate an element of trustworthiness of the message.  The emergency alert server 14 may then generate an emergency alert message based on the
information correlated from mobile device 12 users posting the same emergency information from a certain location.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, the mobile device 12 may provide feedback about the trustworthiness of an emergency alert message.  For example, the indication of trustworthiness may be based on a ranking value provided by the mobile device 12.  In
another embodiment, the indication of trustworthiness may be based on feedback from the mobile device 12.  For example, the mobile device 12 may provide a ranking value on a website or an emergency alert message based on the mobile device 12 user's
perception of the trustworthiness of the message.  This may be accomplished by the mobile device 12 user's ranking, voting, or otherwise providing feedback on the trustworthiness of the emergency alert messages.  In another example the recipient of the
message could rank social media outlets such as individual users or organizations that post emergency-related information.  If the mobile device 12 user believes that the emergency alert message or a user is not posting valid information on the social
media server 16, the mobile device 12 user may provide a low ranking value.  In another example, if the mobile device 12 user believes that the emergency alert message is valid or the user has provided valid information before on the social media server
16, the mobile device 12 user may provide a high ranking value.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, when the mobile device 12 user provides feedback on the indication of trustworthiness, the emergency alert server 14 may update the indication of trustworthiness based on the feedback from the mobile device 12.  For
example, if the mobile device 12 user provides a rating value of low or if the mobile device 12 user provides feedback that the message or the user posting the message are inaccurate, then the emergency alert server 14 may update the indication of
trustworthiness associated with the message to a low value or a value that indicates that the message could not be validated.
<br/><br/> The emergency alert server 14 may also update an emergency alert message based on feedback from a mobile device 12 user.  For example, if the mobile device 12 user provides feedback about an updated status of an emergency, the emergency alert
server 14 may generate an updated emergency alert message.  The emergency alert server 14 may then distribute the updated emergency alert message based on the feedback provided to the social media server 16.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, the mobile device 12 may initiate the validation of a message posted on the social media server 16.  For example, the mobile device 12 user may click on an identifier associated with the emergency alert message such as
a validate button to initiate the validation of an emergency alert message posted on the social media server 16.  The emergency alert message may, for example, have a unique identifier embedded in the message.  In an example embodiment, when the user
clicks on the validate button, a unique identifier associated with the emergency alert message may be sent to a validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14.  The validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may compare the identifier
associated with the embedded message with identifiers that are known to be associated with authenticated sources.  For example, an entity 27 such as the public safety organization may be given an identifier 1234.  Therefore when the entity 27 such as the
public safety organization provides indication of an emergency alert message to be broadcast on the social media server 16, the emergency alert messages will embed the identifier 1234 in the messages.  If a mobile device 12 user, who is not the public
safety organization, posts a message on the social media server 16, the mobile device 12 user's message may have a different identifier, 3456, embedded in the message.  When the mobile device user 12 clicks on the validate button, the validation server
28 or the emergency alert server 14 may compare the identifier embedded in the message, here 3456, with the identifier that are known to be authenticate sources, here 1234.  Since the identifier 3456 does not match with an identifier that is known to be
from an authenticate source, the validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may be unable to validate the emergency alert message.  If the identifiers match, then the validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may indicate that the
message is validated.
<br/><br/> The validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may perform the comparison even without any input from the mobile device 12 user to validate the message.  The validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may compare the
identifier embedded in the token with the identifier it received from the emergency responder.  If the identifiers match, the validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may send an indication to the mobile device 12 indicating that the
information posted on the social media server 16 is valid.  If the identifiers do not match, the validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may send an indication to the mobile device 12 that the information posted on the social media server
16 could not be validated.
<br/><br/> In another example embodiment, the validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may validate the trustworthiness of the emergency alert message by based on information obtained from a variety of sources.  For example, the indication of
trustworthiness may be based on information correlated from information in the social media server 16.  In another example, the indication of trustworthiness may also be based on information correlated from sources other than social media server 16 such
as authenticated websites from public safety.  Therefore, for example, if an emergency alert message is posted on the social media server 16, the validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may validate the trustworthiness of the message by
correlating information from other sources.  For example, if there are many people on social media reporting the same emergency or if authenticated websites such as public safety also report the same information, the validation server 28 or the emergency
alert server 14 may utilize the correlated information to validate the emergency alert message broadcast on the social media server 16.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, trustworthiness of the emergency alert message may be indicative of the source of the message.  For example, if the source of the emergency alert message is from an entity 27 such as an public safety organization, then
the validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may validate the trustworthiness of the message because the source of the emergency alert message is an authenticate source.  In another example embodiment, the indication of the trustworthiness
from validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may be indicative of the data contained in the emergency alert message.  For example, if the emergency alert message is posted by a mobile device 12 user who may not be authenticated, then the
validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may validate that the information contained in the emergency alert message is valid.  If a mobile device 12 user, who is present at the scene of the emergency, posts an emergency alert message on
social media, for example, then the validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may verify that the emergency is valid even though the user is not an authenticated entity 27 such as the public safety organization.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4, FIG. 5, FIG. 6, FIG. 7, and FIG. 8 depict various example embodiments of processes for implementing emergency alert messages via social media.  The processes are described with reference to the system depicted in FIG. 1. 
It is to be understood however, that the implementation of the various example embodiments of processes is not limited thereto.  Systems other than the system depicted in FIG. 1 may be utilized to implement the various embodiments of processes depicted
in FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4, FIG. 5, FIG. 6, FIG. 7, and FIG. 8.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram of an example process for distributing an emergency alert message.  In an example embodiment, the emergency alert server 14 may receive an indication of emergency at step 22 from an entity 27.  Based on that
indication, the emergency alert server 14 may generate an emergency alert message at step 24.  Emergency alert server 14 may then determine how to distribute the emergency alert message via any appropriate medium 23.  For example, emergency alert server
14 may distribute the emergency alert message at step 29 via a social media server 16.  The emergency alert server 14 may also distribute the emergency alert message via other medium at step 25 such as broadcast, video, email, SMS, social media, or the
like, or any appropriate combination thereof.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an example embodiment of trustworthiness of the emergency alert message that may be validated.  In an example embodiment, the emergency alert server 14 or a validation server 28 may determine that emergency alert message needs
to be validated for its trustworthiness at step 31.  An indication of trustworthiness of an emergency alert message may be indicative of the source of the message at step 33.  For example, if the source of the emergency alert message is from an entity 27
such as the public safety organization, then the emergency alert server 14 may indicate that the message is valid because the source of the emergency alert message is an authenticate source.  In another example, if the source of the emergency alert
message is from a standard mobile user 12 such as a reputable news organization, then the emergency alert server 14 may indicate that the message is valid because the source of the emergency alert message is a valid source.  As FIG. 3 further
illustrates, in another example embodiment, the indication of the trustworthiness may be indicative of the information contained in the emergency alert message at step 37.  For example, if the emergency alert message is posted by a mobile device 12 user
that may not be authenticated, then the emergency alert server 14 emergency alert server 14 may validate that the information contained in the emergency alert message is valid.  If a mobile device 12 user, who is present at the scene of the emergency,
posts an emergency alert message on the social media server 16, for example, then the emergency alert server 14 emergency alert server 14 may verify that the emergency is valid even though the mobile device 12 user is not an authenticated source.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 4, the indication of trustworthiness may be based on information obtained from a variety of sources.  In an example embodiment, an emergency alert server 14 distributes an emergency alert message to the social media server
16.  The emergency alert server 14 may correlate data about the emergency from a plurality of sources at step 410.  For example, the emergency alert server may correlate data about the emergency from the social media server 16 or from other mediums such
as websites, TV broadcast etc. Based on the information correlated from the plurality of sources at step 410, the emergency alert server 14 may update the trustworthiness of the emergency alert message based on the correlated data 408.  Therefore, for
example, if there are many people on social media reporting the same emergency or if authenticated websites such as a public safety organization also report the same information, then the emergency alert server 14 emergency alert server 14 may utilize
the correlated information to validate and update the trustworthiness of the emergency alert message.
<br/><br/> As further illustrated in FIG. 4, the indication of trustworthiness may be based on an identifier that is embedded in the emergency alert message at step 404.  For example, a token may be embedded in the emergency alert message.  In another
example, messages distributed by an emergency response may have an embedded validation code, token, or the like.  The token may be associated with the mobile device 12 user posting the emergency alert message or the entity 27 which generated the
emergency alert message.  If the identifier is an authenticated identifier, then the emergency alert server 14 may update the trustworthiness of the message based on the identifier embedded in the emergency alert message at step 406.
<br/><br/> As further illustrated in FIG. 4, the indication of trustworthiness may be based on a ranking value.  In another embodiment, the indication of trustworthiness may be based on feedback from the recipient of the message such as a mobile device 12
user.  For example, when the message is distributed to the social media server at step 402, the mobile device 12 users receive the information at step 412.  The mobile device 12 users may provide feedback such as a ranking value based on their perception
of the trustworthiness of the message.  The feedback may comprise mobile device 12 users ranking, voting, or otherwise providing feedback on the trustworthiness of the emergency alert messages at step 414.  In another example the recipient of the message
may rank social media outlets such as individual users or organizations that post emergency-related information.  If the recipient believes that the emergency alert message or a user is not posting valid information, the recipient may provide a low
ranking value.  In another example, if the recipient believes that the emergency alert message is valid or the user has provided valid information before, the recipient may provide a high ranking value.  Based on the feedback from the recipient of the
message, the emergency alert server 14 may update the indication of trustworthiness of the message at step 416.  For example, if the recipient of the message provides a rating value of low or if the recipient of the message provides feedback that the
message or the user posting the message are inaccurate, then the emergency alert server 14 emergency alert server 14 may update the indication of trustworthiness associated with the message to a low value or a value that indicates that the message could
not be validated.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 5, the emergency alert server 14 may generate message based on information obtained from a plurality of social media sources.  In an example embodiment, the emergency alert server 14 emergency alert server 14 may obtain
information at step 504 from a plurality of social media server 16.  The emergency alert server 14 may correlate the emergency messages from the social media at step 506.  If there are a lot of messages from the social media sources indicating an
emergency, the emergency alert server 14 emergency alert server 14 may generate an emergency alert based on the indication of an emergency from the correlated information.  For example, if the emergency alert server 14 emergency alert server 14
correlates information from authenticated sources such as public safety users on social media, then the emergency alert server 14 emergency alert server 14 may generate an emergency alert message based on this information.  In another example, if the
emergency alert server 14 emergency alert server 14 analyzes that the emergency messages posted by users are located in one locality; this may indicate an element of trustworthiness of the message.  The emergency alert server 14 emergency alert server 15
may then generate an emergency alert message 508 based on the information correlated.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, a plurality of sources such as social media may be utilized to provide emergency responders with information about an emergency.  This information may be correlated to update information that is distributed as an emergency
alert.  For example, an emergency responder may receive information about an emergency via multiple social media modes (Twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> etc.).  In order to know where to send information, in an example embodiment, Public Safety agencies may create
social network sites in advance (e.g., <b><i>Facebook</i></b> page, Twitter site).  The Public Safety agencies may also advertise their social media locations via radio, TV, on emergency vehicles, etc. The advertisement campaign by Public Safety agencies would enable
the general public to recognize bogus sites from the real Public Safety sites.  The emergency responder, or more specifically equipment of the emergency responder, may correlate the information to provide an accurate description of the emergency, such as
track of a storm, tornado, gas plume, etc.
<br/><br/> As further illustrated in FIG. 5, the emergency alert server 14 may generate a message based on an indication of emergency at step 512.  This indication may be provided from an entity 27.  The indication may also be provided by authorized
organizations such as public safety organizations.  Based on an indication of an emergency, the emergency alert server 14 emergency alert server 14 will generate an emergency alert message at step 508.  The emergency alert server 14 emergency alert
server 14 will then distribute the emergency alert message.
<br/><br/> As further illustrated in FIG. 5, the emergency alert server 14 may update a message at step 516 based on feedback from recipient of the message such as a mobile device 12 user.  For example, if the recipient of the message provides feedback at
step 514 about an updated status of an emergency, the emergency alert server 14 may generate an updated emergency alert message at step 516.  The emergency alert server 14 may then distribute the updated emergency alert message based on the feedback
provided at step 510.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 6, information distributed on social media server 16 may be correlated to provide an accurate description of the emergency.  For example, if many people in a location post messages about the state of the emergency, the
information about the emergency may be correlated at step 604 and an updated message may be broadcast that indicates an accurate description of the emergency 608.  The correlated data may help provide a description of the affected areas as well at step
610.  For example, if messages on social media indicate an updated description of the affected areas, the emergency alert server 14 may generate messages indicating an accurate description of the affected areas and post these messages on social media at
step 610.  The correlated information also may be used to predict the state of an emergency at step 606.  For example, based on information posted on a storm, the emergency alert server 14 may be able to predict the path of the storm at step 606.  The
emergency alert server 14 may be able to provide an updated visual image of the description and predictions based on the correlated information at step 612.  The information collected from social media may be correlated to generate and provide predicted
information, such as expected track of a storm, tornado, gas plume, etc. The emergency alert server 14 may, for example, generate a map at step 612 of an emergency area, tracks, effected entities (schools, hospital, food stores, etc.) and distribute at
step 612 this information as part of the emergency alert message.  The information could be distributed via various medium such as social media server 16, websites etc.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 7, in an example embodiment, the emergency alert message may be verified for trustworthiness by validating the indication of trustworthiness embedded in the message.  This validation can take place either by a third party
server 28 or the emergency alert server 14.  In an example embodiment, messages distributed by an emergency response may have an embedded validation code, token, or the like.  In an example embodiment, the token may be transparent to the recipient of the
message.  The identifier may be associated with the user posting the emergency alert message or the user which generated the emergency alert message such as a mobile device 12 user or an entity 27.  The validation server 28 or the emergency alert server
14 may receive an identifier, identifier 1, associated with authenticate sources at step 704.
<br/><br/> As further illustrated in FIG. 7, the validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may receive at step 706 another identifier, identifier 2, embedded in the emergency alert message that the validation server 28 or the emergency alert
server 14 will need to validate.  For example, if user of the social media posts an emergency alert message, a unique identifier associated with the user will be embedded in the message.  When a recipient receives the emergency alert information, the
recipient may validate the information by selecting a validate button, or the like.  Clicking the button may send the embedded validation identifier to the third party.  The emergency alert server 14 may compare at step 708 the identifier associated with
the embedded message with identifiers that are known to be associated with authenticated sources.  For example, a public safety organization may be given an identifier 1234.  Therefore when the public safety organization posts emergency alert messages on
the social media, the messages will embed the identifier 1234 in the messages.  If a user, who is not the public safety organization, posts a message, the user's message may have a different identifier, 3456, embedded in the message.  When the user
clicks on the validate button, the emergency alert server 14 may compare the identifier embedded in the message, here 3456, with the identifier that are known to be authenticate sources, here 1234.  Since the identifier 3456 does not match with an
identifier that is known to be from an authenticate source, the emergency alert server 14 will be unable to validate the emergency alert message at step 710.  If the identifiers match, then the emergency alert server 14 will indicate that the message is
validated at step 712.  The emergency alert server 14 may do the comparison even without any input from the user to validate the message.  The validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may compare 708 the received validation identifier,
identifier 2, with the validation identifier, identifier 1, it received from the emergency responder.  If the identifiers match, the validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may send an indication to the recipient indicating that the
information is valid 710.  If the identifier does not match, the validation server 28 or the emergency alert server 14 may send an indication at step 712 to the recipient that the information could not be validated.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 8, the identifier associated with users also may be generated in a system.  For example, if a user signs up to a service, the service may automatically generate identifiers associated with the user at step 804.  The user
may then have that identifier associated with it when the user posts messages via the service.  The service may include subscribing to the emergency alert server 14 or the social media server 16 or the like.  The service may determine authenticated users
when they sign up.  For example, when a public safety organization signs up, the service may determine that the organization is an authenticate source.  Therefore, when the public safety organization posts message, the emergency alert server 14 will
automatically compare at step 708 the identifier embedded in the message with a known authenticate identifier and validate the message is there is a match at step 710.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a block diagram of an example communications device 120 configured to facilitate distribution and validation of messages on social media.  In an example embodiment, the communications device 120 may comprise the mobile device 12.  In

appropriate combination thereof.  It is emphasized that the block diagram depicted in FIG. 3 is exemplary and not intended to imply a specific implementation or configuration.  Thus, the system 130 may be implemented in a single processor or multiple
processors (e.g., single server or multiple servers, single gateway or multiple gateways, single system or multiple systems, etc.).  Multiple systems may be distributed or centrally located.  Multiple systems may communicate wirelessly, via hard wire, or
a combination thereof.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, the system 130 comprises a processor and memory coupled to the processor.  The memory may comprise executable instructions that when executed by the processor cause the processor to effectuate operations associated with
distribution and validation of emergency alert message services.  As evident from the herein description, a system or any portion thereof is not to be construed as software per se.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, the system 130 comprises a processor and memory coupled to the processor.  The memory may comprise executable instructions that when executed by the processor cause the processor to effectuate operations associated with
distribution and validation of emergency alert message services.
<br/><br/> In an example configuration, the system 130 comprises a processing portion 132, a memory portion 134, and an input/output portion 136.  The processing portion 132, memory portion 134, and input/output portion 136 are coupled together (coupling
not shown in FIG. 9) to allow communications there between.  The input/output portion 136 may be capable of receiving and/or providing information from/to a communications device and/or other network entities configured to be utilized with distribution
and validation of emergency alert message services via social media.  For example, the input/output portion 136 may include a wireless communications (e.g., 2.5G/3G/4G/GPS) card.  The input/output portion 136 may be capable of receiving and/or sending
video information, audio information, control information, image information, data, or any combination thereof.  In an example embodiment, the input/output portion 36 may be capable of receiving and/or sending information to determine a location of the
system 130 and/or the communications device 30.  In an example configuration, the input\output portion 136 may comprise and/or be coupled to a GPS receiver.  In an example configuration, the system 130 may determine its own geographical location and/or
the geographical location of a communications device through any type of location determination system including, for example, the Global Positioning System (GPS), assisted GPS (A-GPS), time difference of arrival calculations, configured constant
location (in the case of non-moving devices), any combination thereof, or any other appropriate means.  In various configurations, the input/output portion 136 may receive and/or provide information via any appropriate means, such as, for example,
optical means (e.g., infrared), electromagnetic means (e.g., RF, WI-FI, BLUETOOTH, ZIGBEE, etc.), acoustic means (e.g., speaker, microphone, ultrasonic receiver, ultrasonic transmitter), or a combination thereof.  In an example configuration, the
input/output portion may comprise a WIFI finder, a two way GPS chipset or equivalent, or the like, or a combination thereof.
<br/><br/> The processing portion 132 may be capable of performing functions associated with distribution and validation of emergency alert message services as described herein.  That is, a communications device (e.g., communications device 120) may
perform functions internally (by the device) and/or utilize the system 130 to perform functions.  For example, the processing portion 132 may be capable of, in conjunction with any other portion of the system 130, installing an application for
distribution and validation of emergency alert message services, processing an application for distribution and validation of emergency alert message services, configuring the system 130 to function as a gateway for other devices to a network,
determining the location at which to provide distribution and validation of emergency alert message services, or the like, or any combination thereof.  The processing portion 132, in conjunction with any other portion of the system 130, enables the
system 130 to covert speech to text when it is configured to enhance location based services.
<br/><br/> In a basic configuration, the system 130 may include at least one memory portion 134.  The memory portion 134 may comprise a storage medium having a tangible physical structure.  Thus, the memory portion 134, as well as any computer-readable
storage medium described herein, is not to be construed as a transient signal per se.  The memory portion 134, as well as any computer-readable storage medium described herein, is not to be construed as a propagating signal per se.  The memory portion
134 may store any information utilized in conjunction with distribution and validation of emergency alert message services as described herein.  Depending upon the exact configuration and type of processor, the memory portion 134 may be volatile 138
(such as some types of RAM), non-volatile 140 (such as ROM, flash memory, etc.), or a combination thereof.  The system 130 may include additional storage (e.g., removable storage 142 and/or non-removable storage 144) including, but not limited to, tape,
flash memory, smart cards, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, universal serial bus (USB) compatible memory, or any other medium which
can be used to store information and which can be accessed by the system 130.  One or more applications are loaded into mass memory and run on operating system.  Examples of application programs may include transcoders, schedulers, calendars, database
programs, word processing programs, HTTP programs, customizable user interface programs, IPSec applications, encryption programs, security programs, VPN programs, SMS message servers, IM message servers, email servers, account management and so forth. 
Vitality Data Manager (VDM) may also be included as an application program within applications 350.  VDM is configured to receive from a variety of sources information that may be associated with social networking activities of various social networking
members.  Such information may include but is not limited to various communications, including emails, SMS messages, IM messages, audio messages, VOIP messages, RSS feeds, membership information, calendar events, photo streams, photographs, blog updates,
web pages, mood information, behaviors of social network members, or the like.  VDM may aggregate or otherwise combine at least some of the received information to generate aggregate vitality information such as a mood of a group, organization, or the
like, group events, albums, aggregate music selections, tags, or the like.  VDM may also distribute at least some of the received and/or aggregated information to one or more social networking members, such as mobile devices and/or client device of FIG.
1 or the like.  VDM may employ a process substantially similar to that described below in conjunction with FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> The system 130 also may contain communications connection(s) 150 that allow the system 130 to communicate with other devices, systems, or the like.  A communications connection(s) can comprise communication media.  Communication media typically
embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media.  By way of example, and not limitation,
communication media include wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared, and other wireless media.  The term computer readable media as used herein includes both storage media and
communication media.  The system 130 also can include input device(s) 146 such as keyboard, mouse, pen, voice input device, touch input device, etc. Output device(s) 148 such as a display, speakers, printer, etc. also can be included.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 depicts an overall block diagram of an example packet-based mobile cellular network environment, such as a GPRS network, within which distribution and validation of emergency alert message services may be implemented.  In the example
packet-based mobile cellular network environment shown in FIG. 10, there are a plurality of Base Station Subsystems ("BSS") 800 (only one is shown), each of which comprises a Base Station Controller ("BSC") 802 serving a plurality of Base Transceiver
Stations ("BTS") such as BTSs 804, 806, and 808.  BTSs 804, 806, 808, etc. are the access points where users of packet-based mobile devices become connected to the wireless network.  In example fashion, the packet traffic originating from user devices is
transported via an over-the-air interface to a BTS 808, and from the BTS 808 to the BSC 802.  Base station subsystems, such as BSS 800, are a part of internal frame relay network 810 that can include Service GPRS Support Nodes ("SGSN") such as SGSN 812
and 814.  Each SGSN is connected to an internal packet network 820 through which a SGSN 812, 814, etc. can route data packets to and from a plurality of gateway GPRS support nodes (GGSN) 822, 824, 826, etc. As illustrated, SGSN 814 and GGSNs 822, 824,
and 826 are part of internal packet network 820.  Gateway GPRS serving nodes 822, 824 and 826 mainly provide an interface to external Internet Protocol ("IP") networks such as Public Land Mobile Network ("PLMN") 850, corporate intranets 840, or Fixed-End
System ("FES") or the public Internet 830.  As illustrated, subscriber corporate network 840 may be connected to GGSN 824 via firewall 832; and PLMN 850 is connected to GGSN 824 via boarder gateway router 834.  The Remote Authentication Dial-In User
Service ("RADIUS") server 842 may be used for caller authentication when a user of a mobile cellular device calls corporate network 840.
<br/><br/> Generally, there can be a several cell sizes in a GSM network, referred to as macro, micro, pico, femto and umbrella cells.  The coverage area of each cell is different in different environments.  Macro cells can be regarded as cells in which
the base station antenna is installed in a mast or a building above average roof top level.  Micro cells are cells whose antenna height is under average roof top level.  Micro-cells are typically used in urban areas.  Pico cells are small cells having a
diameter of a few dozen meters.  Pico cells are used mainly indoors.  Femto cells have the same size as pico cells, but a smaller transport capacity.  Femto cells are used indoors, in residential, or small business environments.  On the other hand,
umbrella cells are used to cover shadowed regions of smaller cells and fill in gaps in coverage between those cells.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 illustrates an architecture of a typical GPRS network within which text message generation for emergency services can be implemented.  The architecture depicted in FIG. 11 is segmented into four groups: users 950, radio access network
960, core network 970, and interconnect network 980.  Users 950 comprise a plurality of end users.  Note, device 912 is referred to as a mobile subscriber in the description of network shown in FIG. 11.  In an example embodiment, the device depicted as
mobile subscriber 912 comprises a communications device (e.g., communications device 160).  Radio access network 960 comprises a plurality of base station subsystems such as BSSs 962, which include BTSs 964 and BSCs 966.  Core network 970 comprises a
host of various network elements.  As illustrated in FIG. 11, core network 970 may comprise Mobile Switching Center ("MSC") 971, Service Control Point ("SCP") 972, gateway MSC 973, SGSN 976, Home Location Register ("HLR") 974, Authentication Center
("AuC") 975, Domain Name Server ("DNS") 977, and GGSN 978.  Interconnect network 980 also comprises a host of various networks and other network elements.  As illustrated in FIG. 11, interconnect network 980 comprises Public Switched Telephone Network
("PSTN") 982, Fixed-End System ("FES") or Internet 984, firewall 988, and Corporate Network 989.
<br/><br/> A mobile switching center can be connected to a large number of base station controllers.  At MSC 971, for instance, depending on the type of traffic, the traffic may be separated in that voice may be sent to Public Switched Telephone Network
("PSTN") 982 through Gateway MSC ("GMSC") 973, and/or data may be sent to SGSN 976, which then sends the data traffic to GGSN 978 for further forwarding.
<br/><br/> When MSC 971 receives call traffic, for example, from BSC 966, it sends a query to a database hosted by SCP 972.  The SCP 972 processes the request and issues a response to MSC 971 so that it may continue call processing as appropriate.
<br/><br/> The HLR 974 is a centralized database for users to register to the GPRS network.  HLR 974 stores static information about the subscribers such as the International Mobile Subscriber Identity ("IMSI"), subscribed services, and a key for
authenticating the subscriber.  HLR 974 also stores dynamic subscriber information such as the current location of the mobile subscriber.  Associated with HLR 974 is AuC 975.  AuC 975 is a database that contains the algorithms for authenticating
subscribers and includes the associated keys for encryption to safeguard the user input for authentication.
<br/><br/> In the following, depending on context, the term "mobile subscriber" sometimes refers to the end user and sometimes to the actual portable device, such as a mobile device, used by an end user of the mobile cellular service.  When a mobile
subscriber turns on his or her mobile device, the mobile device goes through an attach process by which the mobile device attaches to an SGSN of the GPRS network.  In FIG. 11, when mobile subscriber 912 initiates the attach process by turning on the
network capabilities of the mobile device, an attach request is sent by mobile subscriber 912 to SGSN 976.  The SGSN 976 queries another SGSN, to which mobile subscriber 912 was attached before, for the identity of mobile subscriber 912.  Upon receiving
the identity of mobile subscriber 912 from the other SGSN, SGSN 976 requests more information from mobile subscriber 912.  This information is used to authenticate mobile subscriber 912 to SGSN 976 by HLR 974.  Once verified, SGSN 976 sends a location
update to HLR 974 indicating the change of location to a new SGSN, in this case SGSN 976.  HLR 974 notifies the old SGSN, to which mobile subscriber 912 was attached before, to cancel the location process for mobile subscriber 912.  HLR 974 then notifies
SGSN 976 that the location update has been performed.  At this time, SGSN 976 sends an Attach Accept message to mobile subscriber 912, which in turn sends an Attach Complete message to SGSN 976.
<br/><br/> After attaching itself with the network, mobile subscriber 912 then goes through the authentication process.  In the authentication process, SGSN 976 sends the authentication information to HLR 974, which sends information back to SGSN 976 based
on the user profile that was part of the user's initial setup.  The SGSN 976 then sends a request for authentication and ciphering to mobile subscriber 912.  The mobile subscriber 912 uses an algorithm to send the user identification (ID) and password to
SGSN 976.  The SGSN 976 uses the same algorithm and compares the result.  If a match occurs, SGSN 976 authenticates mobile subscriber 912.
<br/><br/> Next, the mobile subscriber 912 establishes a user session with the destination network, corporate network 989, by going through a Packet Data Protocol ("PDP") activation process.  Briefly, in the process, mobile subscriber 912 requests access
to the Access Point Name ("APN"), for example, UPS.com, and SGSN 976 receives the activation request from mobile subscriber 912.  SGSN 976 then initiates a Domain Name Service ("DNS") query to learn which GGSN node has access to the UPS.com APN.  The DNS
query is sent to the DNS server within the core network 970, such as DNS 977, which is provisioned to map to one or more GGSN nodes in the core network 970.  Based on the APN, the mapped GGSN 978 can access the requested corporate network 989.  The SGSN
976 then sends to GGSN 978 a Create Packet Data Protocol ("PDP") Context Request message that contains necessary information.  The GGSN 978 sends a Create PDP Context Response message to SGSN 976, which then sends an Activate PDP Context Accept message
to mobile subscriber 912.
<br/><br/> Once activated, data packets of the call made by mobile subscriber 912 can then go through radio access network 960, core network 970, and interconnect network 980, in a particular fixed-end system or Internet 984 and firewall 988, to reach
corporate network 989.
<br/><br/> FIG. 15 illustrates an example block diagram view of a GSM/GPRS/IP multimedia network architecture within which text message generation for emergency services may be implemented.  As illustrated, the architecture of FIG. 12 includes a GSM core
network 1001, a GPRS network 1030 and an IP multimedia network 1038.  The GSM core network 1001 includes a Mobile Station (MS) 1002, at least one Base Transceiver Station (BTS) 1004 and a Base Station Controller (BSC) 1006.  The MS 1002 is physical
equipment or Mobile Equipment (ME), such as a mobile phone or a laptop computer that is used by mobile subscribers, with a Subscriber identity Module (SIM) or a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC).  The SIM or UICC includes an International Mobile
Subscriber Identity (IMSI), which is a unique identifier of a subscriber.  The BTS 1004 is physical equipment, such as a radio tower, that enables a radio interface to communicate with the MS.  Each BTS may serve more than one MS.  The BSC 1006 manages
radio resources, including the BTS.  The BSC may be connected to several BTSs.  The BSC and BTS components, in combination, are generally referred to as a base station (BSS) or radio access network (RAN) 1003.
<br/><br/> The GSM core network 1001 also includes a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 1008, a Gateway Mobile Switching Center (GMSC) 1010, a Home Location Register (HLR) 1012, Visitor Location Register (VLR) 1014, an Authentication Center (AuC) 1018, and an
Equipment Identity Register (EIR) 1016.  The MSC 1008 performs a switching function for the network.  The MSC also performs other functions, such as registration, authentication, location updating, handovers, and call routing.  The GMSC 1010 provides a
gateway between the GSM network and other networks, such as an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) or Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs) 1020.  Thus, the GMSC 1010 provides interworking functionality with external networks.
<br/><br/> The HLR 1012 is a database that contains administrative information regarding each subscriber registered in a corresponding GSM network.  The HLR 1012 also contains the current location of each MS.  The VLR 1014 is a database that contains
selected administrative information from the HLR 1012.  The VLR contains information necessary for call control and provision of subscribed services for each MS currently located in a geographical area controlled by the VLR.  The HLR 1012 and the VLR
1014, together with the MSC 1008, provide the call routing and roaming capabilities of GSM.  The AuC 1016 provides the parameters needed for authentication and encryption functions.  Such parameters allow verification of a subscriber's identity.  The EIR
1018 stores security-sensitive information about the mobile equipment.
<br/><br/> A Short Message Service Center (SMSC) 1009 allows one-to-one Short Message Service (SMS) messages to be sent to/from the MS 1002.  A Push Proxy Gateway (PPG) 1011 is used to "push" (i.e., send without a synchronous request) content to the MS
1002.  The PPG 1011 acts as a proxy between wired and wireless networks to facilitate pushing of data to the MS 1002.  A Short Message Peer to Peer (SMPP) protocol router 1013 is provided to convert SMS-based SMPP messages to cell broadcast messages. 
SMPP is a protocol for exchanging SMS messages between SMS peer entities such as short message service centers.  The SMPP protocol is often used to allow third parties, e.g., content suppliers such as news organizations, to submit bulk messages.
<br/><br/> To gain access to GSM services, such as speech, data, and short message service (SMS), the MS first registers with the network to indicate its current location by performing a location update and IMSI attach procedure.  The MS 1002 sends a
location update including its current location information to the MSC/VLR, via the BTS 1004 and the BSC 1006.  The location information is then sent to the MS's HLR.  The HLR is updated with the location information received from the MSC/VLR.  The
location update also is performed when the MS moves to a new location area.  Typically, the location update is periodically performed to update the database as location updating events occur.
<br/><br/> The GPRS network 1030 is logically implemented on the GSM core network architecture by introducing two packet-switching network nodes, a serving GPRS support node (SGSN) 1032, a cell broadcast and a Gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) 1034.  The
SGSN 1032 is at the same hierarchical level as the MSC 1008 in the GSM network.  The SGSN controls the connection between the GPRS network and the MS 1002.  The SGSN also keeps track of individual MS's locations and security functions and access
controls.
<br/><br/> A Cell Broadcast Center (CBC) 14 communicates cell broadcast messages that are typically delivered to multiple users in a specified area.  Cell Broadcast is one-to-many geographically focused service.  It enables messages to be communicated to
multiple mobile phone customers who are located within a given part of its network coverage area at the time the message is broadcast.
<br/><br/> The GGSN 1034 provides a gateway between the GPRS network and a public packet network (PDN) or other IP networks 1036.  That is, the GGSN provides interworking functionality with external networks, and sets up a logical link to the MS through
the SGSN.  When packet-switched data leaves the GPRS network, it is transferred to an external TCP-IP network 1036, such as an X.25 network or the Internet.  In order to access GPRS services, the MS first attaches itself to the GPRS network by performing
an attach procedure.  The MS then activates a packet data protocol (PDP) context, thus activating a packet communication session between the MS, the SGSN, and the GGSN.
<br/><br/> In a GSM/GPRS network, GPRS services and GSM services can be used in parallel.  The MS can operate in one of three classes: class A, class B, and class C. A class A MS can attach to the network for both GPRS services and GSM services
simultaneously.  A class A MS also supports simultaneous operation of GPRS services and GSM services.  For example, class A mobiles can receive GSM voice/data/SMS calls and GPRS data calls at the same time.
<br/><br/> A class B MS can attach to the network for both GPRS services and GSM services simultaneously.  However, a class B MS does not support simultaneous operation of the GPRS services and GSM services.  That is, a class B MS can only use one of the
two services at a given time.
<br/><br/> A class C MS can attach for only one of the GPRS services and GSM services at a time.  Simultaneous attachment and operation of GPRS services and GSM services is not possible with a class C MS.
<br/><br/> A GPRS network 1030 can be designed to operate in three network operation modes (NOM1, NOM2 and NOM3).  A network operation mode of a GPRS network is indicated by a parameter in system information messages transmitted within a cell.  The system
information messages dictates a MS where to listen for paging messages and how to signal towards the network.  The network operation mode represents the capabilities of the GPRS network.  In a NOM1 network, a MS can receive pages from a circuit switched
domain (voice call) when engaged in a data call.  The MS can suspend the data call or take both simultaneously, depending on the ability of the MS.  In a NOM2 network, a MS may not receive pages from a circuit switched domain when engaged in a data call,
since the MS is receiving data and is not listening to a paging channel.  In a NOM3 network, a MS can monitor pages for a circuit switched network while received data and vice versa.
<br/><br/> The IP multimedia network 1038 was introduced with 3GPP Release 5, and includes an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) 1040 to provide rich multimedia services to end users.  A representative set of the network entities within the IMS 1040 are a
call/session control function (CSCF), a media gateway control function (MGCF) 1046, a media gateway (MGW) 1048, and a master subscriber database, called a home subscriber server (HSS) 1050.  The HSS 1050 may be common to the GSM network 1001, the GPRS
network 1030 as well as the IP multimedia network 1038.
<br/><br/> The IP multimedia system 1040 is built around the call/session control function, of which there are three types: an interrogating CSCF (I-CSCF) 1043, a proxy CSCF (P-CSCF) 1042, and a serving CSCF (S-CSCF) 1044.  The P-CSCF 1042 is the MS's
first point of contact with the IMS 1040.  The P-CSCF 1042 forwards session initiation protocol (SIP) messages received from the MS to an SIP server in a home network (and vice versa) of the MS.  The P-CSCF 1042 may also modify an outgoing request
according to a set of rules defined by the network operator (for example, address analysis and potential modification).
<br/><br/> The I-CSCF 1043, forms an entrance to a home network and hides the inner topology of the home network from other networks and provides flexibility for selecting an S-CSCF.  The I-CSCF 1043 may contact a subscriber location function (SLF) 1045 to
determine which HSS 1050 to use for the particular subscriber, if multiple HSS's 1050 are present.  The S-CSCF 1044 performs the session control services for the MS 1002.  This includes routing originating sessions to external networks and routing
terminating sessions to visited networks.  The S-CSCF 1044 also decides whether an application server (AS) 1052 is required to receive information on an incoming SIP session request to ensure appropriate service handling.  This decision is based on
information received from the HSS 1050 (or other sources, such as an application server 1052).  The AS 1052 also communicates to a location server 1056 (e.g., a Gateway Mobile Location Center (GMLC)) that provides a position (e.g., latitude/longitude
coordinates) of the MS 1002.
<br/><br/> The HSS 1050 contains a subscriber profile and keeps track of which core network node is currently handling the subscriber.  It also supports subscriber authentication and authorization functions (AAA).  In networks with more than one HSS 1050,
a subscriber location function provides information on the HSS 1050 that contains the profile of a given subscriber.
<br/><br/> The MGCF 1046 provides interworking functionality between SIP session control signaling from the IMS 1040 and ISUP/BICC call control signaling from the external GSTN networks (not shown).  It also controls the media gateway (MGW) 1048 that
provides user-plane interworking functionality (e.g., converting between AMR- and PCM-coded voice).  The MGW 1048 also communicates with other IP multimedia networks 1054.
<br/><br/> Push to Talk over Cellular (PoC) capable mobile phones register with the wireless network when the phones are in a predefined area (e.g., job site, etc.).  When the mobile phones leave the area, they register with the network in their new
location as being outside the predefined area.  This registration, however, does not indicate the actual physical location of the mobile phones outside the pre-defined area.
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 illustrates a PLMN block diagram view of an example architecture in which text message generation for emergency services may be incorporated.  Mobile Station (MS) 1401 is the physical equipment used by the PLMN subscriber.  In one
illustrative embodiment, communications device 200 may serve as Mobile Station 1401.  Mobile Station 1401 may be one of, but not limited to, a cellular telephone, a cellular telephone in combination with another electronic device or any other wireless
mobile communication device.
<br/><br/> Mobile Station 1401 may communicate wirelessly with Base Station System (BSS) 1410.  BSS 1410 contains a Base Station Controller (BSC) 1411 and a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) 1412.  BSS 1410 may include a single BSC 1411/BTS 1412 pair (Base
Station) or a system of BSC/BTS pairs which are part of a larger network.  BSS 1410 is responsible for communicating with Mobile Station 1401 and may support one or more cells.  BSS 1410 is responsible for handling cellular traffic and signaling between
Mobile Station 1401 and Core Network 1440.  Typically, BSS 1410 performs functions that include, but are not limited to, digital conversion of speech channels, allocation of channels to mobile devices, paging, and transmission/reception of cellular
signals.
<br/><br/> Additionally, Mobile Station 1401 may communicate wirelessly with Radio Network System (RNS) 1420.  RNS 1420 contains a Radio Network Controller (RNC) 1421 and one or more Node(s) B 1422.  RNS 1420 may support one or more cells.  RNS 1420 may
also include one or more RNC 1421/Node B 1422 pairs or alternatively a single RNC 1421 may manage multiple Nodes B 1422.  RNS 1420 is responsible for communicating with Mobile Station 1401 in its geographically defined area.  RNC 1421 is responsible for
controlling the Node(s) B 1422 that are connected to it and is a control element in a UMTS radio access network.  RNC 1421 performs functions such as, but not limited to, load control, packet scheduling, handover control, security functions, as well as
controlling Mobile Station 1401's access to the Core Network (CN) 1440.
<br/><br/> The evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) 1430 is a radio access network that provides wireless data communications for Mobile Station 1401 and User Equipment 1402.  E-UTRAN 1430 provides higher data rates than traditional
UMTS.  It is part of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) upgrade for mobile networks and later releases meet the requirements of the International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) Advanced and are commonly known as a 4G networks.  E-UTRAN 1430 may include of
series of logical network components such as E-UTRAN Node B (eNB) 1431 and E-UTRAN Node B (eNB) 1432.  E-UTRAN 1430 may contain one or more eNBs.  User Equipment 1402 may be any user device capable of connecting to E-UTRAN 1430 including, but not limited
to, a personal computer, laptop, mobile device, wireless router, or other device capable of wireless connectivity to E-UTRAN 1430.  The improved performance of the E-UTRAN 1430 relative to a typical UMTS network allows for increased bandwidth, spectral
efficiency, and functionality including, but not limited to, voice, high-speed applications, large data transfer and IPTV, while still allowing for full mobility.
<br/><br/> An example embodiment of a mobile data and communication service that may be implemented in the PLMN architecture described in FIG. 13 is the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE).  EDGE is an enhancement for GPRS networks that implements
an improved signal modulation scheme known as 8-PSK (Phase Shift Keying).  By increasing network utilization, EDGE may achieve up to three times faster data rates as compared to a typical GPRS network.  EDGE may be implemented on any GSM network capable
of hosting a GPRS network, making it an ideal upgrade over GPRS since it may provide increased functionality of existing network resources.  Evolved EDGE networks are becoming standardized in later releases of the radio telecommunication standards, which
provide for even greater efficiency and peak data rates of up to 1 Mbit/s, while still allowing implementation on existing GPRS-capable network infrastructure.
<br/><br/> Typically Mobile Station 1401 may communicate with any or all of BSS 1410, RNS 1420, or E-UTRAN 1430.  In a illustrative system, each of BSS 1410, RNS 1420, and E-UTRAN 1430 may provide Mobile Station 1401 with access to Core Network 1440.  The
Core Network 1440 may include of a series of devices that route data and communications between end users.  Core Network 1440 may provide network service functions to users in the Circuit Switched (CS) domain, the Packet Switched (PS) domain or both. 
The CS domain refers to connections in which dedicated network resources are allocated at the time of connection establishment and then released when the connection is terminated.  The PS domain refers to communications and data transfers that make use
of autonomous groupings of bits called packets.  Each packet may be routed, manipulated, processed or handled independently of all other packets in the PS domain and does not require dedicated network resources.
<br/><br/> The Circuit Switched--Media Gateway Function (CS-MGW) 1441 is part of Core Network 1440, and interacts with Visitor Location Register (VLR) and Mobile-Services Switching Center (MSC) Server 1460 and Gateway MSC Server 1461 in order to facilitate
Core Network 1440 resource control in the CS domain.  Functions of CS-MGW 1441 include, but are not limited to, media conversion, bearer control, payload processing and other mobile network processing such as handover or anchoring.  CS-MGW 1440 may
receive connections to Mobile Station 1401 through BSS 1410, RNS 1420 or both.
<br/><br/> Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 1442 stores subscriber data regarding Mobile Station 1401 in order to facilitate network functionality.  SGSN 1442 may store subscription information such as, but not limited to, the International Mobile
Subscriber Identity (IMSI), temporary identities, or Packet Data Protocol (PDP) addresses.  SGSN 1442 may also store location information such as, but not limited to, the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 1444 address for each GGSN where an active PDP
exists.  GGSN 1444 may implement a location register function to store subscriber data it receives from SGSN 1442 such as subscription or location information.
<br/><br/> Serving Gateway (S-GW) 1443 is an interface which provides connectivity between E-UTRAN 1430 and Core Network 1440.  Functions of S-GW 1443 include, but are not limited to, packet routing, packet forwarding, transport level packet processing,
event reporting to Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) 1450, and mobility anchoring for inter-network mobility.  PCRF 1450 uses information gathered from S-GW 1443, as well as other sources, to make applicable policy and charging decisions related
to data flows, network resources and other network administration functions.  Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN-GW) 1445 may provide user-to-services connectivity functionality including, but not limited to, network-wide mobility anchoring, bearer session
anchoring and control, and IP address allocation for PS domain connections.
<br/><br/> Home Subscriber Server (HSS) 1463 is a database for user information, and stores subscription data regarding Mobile Station 1401 or User Equipment 1402 for handling calls or data sessions.  Networks may contain one HSS 1463 or more if additional
resources are required.  Example data stored by HSS 1463 include, but is not limited to, user identification, numbering and addressing information, security information, or location information.  HSS 1463 may also provide call or session establishment
procedures in both the PS and CS domains.
<br/><br/> The VLR/MSC Server 1460 provides user location functionality.  When Mobile Station 1401 enters a new network location, it begins a registration procedure.  A MSC Server for that location transfers the location information to the VLR for the
area.  A VLR and MSC Server may be located in the same computing environment, as is shown by VLR/MSC Server 1460, or alternatively may be located in separate computing environments.  A VLR may contain, but is not limited to, user information such as the
IMSI, the Temporary Mobile Station Identity (TMSI), the Local Mobile Station Identity (LMSI), the last known location of the mobile station, or the SGSN where the mobile station was previously registered.  The MSC server may contain information such as,
but not limited to, procedures for Mobile Station 1401 registration or procedures for handover of Mobile Station 1401 to a different section of the Core Network 1440.  GMSC Server 1461 may serve as a connection to alternate GMSC Servers for other mobile
stations in larger networks.
<br/><br/> Equipment Identity Register (EIR) 1462 is a logical element which may store the International Mobile Equipment Identities (IMEI) for Mobile Station 1401.  In a typical embodiment, user equipment may be classified as either "white listed" or
"black listed" depending on its status in the network.  In one embodiment, if Mobile Station 1401 is stolen and put to use by an unauthorized user, it may be registered as "black listed" in EIR 1462, preventing its use on the network.  Mobility
Management Entity (MME) 1464 is a control node which may track Mobile Station 1401 or User Equipment 1402 if the devices are idle.  Additional functionality may include the ability of MME 1464 to contact an idle Mobile Station 1401 or User Equipment 1402
if retransmission of a previous session is required.
<br/><br/> While example embodiments of distribution and validation of emergency alert message via social media have been described in connection with various computing devices/processors, the underlying concepts may be applied to any computing device,
processor, or system capable of implementing distribution and validation of emergency alert message via social media.  The various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or, where appropriate, with a
combination of both.  Thus, the methods and apparatuses of using and implementing distribution and validation of emergency alert message via social media may be implemented, or certain aspects or portions thereof, can take the form of program code (i.e.,
instructions) embodied in tangible storage media having a tangible physical structure.  Examples of tangible storage media include floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, DVDs, hard drives, or any other tangible machine-readable storage medium (computer-readable
storage medium).  Thus, a computer-readable storage medium is not a transient signal per se.  A computer-readable storage medium is not a propagating signal per se.  When the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the
machine becomes an apparatus for implementing distribution and validation of emergency alert message services.  In the case of program code execution on programmable computers, the computing device will generally include a processor, a storage medium
readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device.  The program(s) can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired.  The language can
be a compiled or interpreted language, and combined with hardware implementations.
<br/><br/> The methods and apparatuses for using and implementing operations for facilitating distribution of emergency alert messages via social media also may be practiced via communications embodied in the form of program code that is transmitted over
some transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via any other form of transmission, wherein, when the program code is received and loaded into and executed by a machine, such as an EPROM, a gate array, a
programmable logic device (PLD), a client computer, or the like, the machine becomes an apparatus for implementing distribution and validation of emergency alert message services.  When implemented on a general-purpose processor, the program code
combines with the processor to provide a unique apparatus that operates to invoke the functionality of distribution and validation of emergency alert message via social media.
<br/><br/> While operations for facilitating distribution of emergency alert messages via social media have been described in connection with the various embodiments of the various figures, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments can be used
or modifications and additions can be made to the described embodiments for implementing distribution and validation of emergency alert message via social media without deviating therefrom.  For example, one skilled in the art will recognize that
distribution and validation of emergency alert message services as described in the present application may apply to any environment, whether wired or wireless, and may be applied to any number of such devices connected via a communications network and
interacting across the network.  Therefore, distribution and validation of emergency alert messages via social media should not be limited to any single embodiment, but rather should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended
claims.
