       <font size="+1">Suppressing duplicate listings on multiple search engine web sites from a
     single source system given that a publisher selects a different listing
     as a synchronized listing
</font><br/>
       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A source system receives initial identification data of a listing related
     to an entity. The source system searches a provider system for one or
     more listings having identification data matching the initial
     identification data. The source system receives, from the provider
     system, a plurality of potential matching listings having identification
     data matching the initial identification data, wherein each listing of
     the plurality of potential matching listings has a corresponding
     confidence score assigned by the source system, and wherein each listing
     of the plurality of potential matching listings has a corresponding
     provider-supplied external identifier assigned by the provider system.
     The source system designates a representative listing of the entity
     located on a provider system from among the plurality of potential
     matching listings, the representative listing having the highest
     confidence score assigned by the source system. The source system
     transmits, to the provider system, a request to synchronize the
     representative listing having the highest confidence score assigned by
     the source system as the representative listing of the entity on the
     provider system, the request comprising a first provider-supplied
     external identifier. The source system receives, from the provider
     system, an indication that a second listing of the plurality of potential
     matching listings has been selected by the provider system as the
     representative listing of the entity on the provider system, the response
     comprising a second provider-supplied external identifier. The source
     system re-designates the second listing as the representative listing of
     the entity on the provider system and designating the remaining one or
     more remaining listing of the plurality of potential matching listings as
     one or more duplicate listings on the provider system. The source system
     transmits, to the provider system, a request to suppress the remaining
     one or more listings as one or more duplicate listings, the request to
     suppress the remaining one or more listings comprising one or more third
     provider-supplied external identifiers.

<br/><br/> This application is a continuation of and claims the benefit of U.S.
     patent application Ser. No. 14/793,263 filed Jul. 7, 2015, the disclosure
     of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method, comprising: receiving, by a source system, initial identification data of a listing related to an entity;  searching a provider system, by the source system,
for one or more listings having identification data matching the initial identification data;  receiving, by the source system from the provider system, a plurality of potential matching listings having identification data matching the initial
identification data, wherein each listing of the plurality of potential matching listings has a corresponding confidence score assigned by the source system, and wherein each listing of the plurality of potential matching listings has a corresponding
provider-supplied external identifier previously assigned by the provider system to identify a potential matching listing;  designating, by the source system, a representative listing of the entity located on a provider system from among the plurality of
potential matching listings, the representative listing having the highest confidence score assigned by the source system;  transmitting, by the source system to the provider system, a request to synchronize the representative listing having the highest
confidence score assigned by the source system as the representative listing of the entity on the provider system, the request comprising a first provider-supplied external identifier previously assigned by the provider system to identify the first
matching listing;  receiving, by the source system from the provider system, an indication that a second listing of the plurality of potential matching listings has been selected by the provider system as the representative listing of the entity on the
provider system, the response comprising a second provider-supplied external identifier previously assigned by the provider system to identify the second matching listing;  re-designating, by the source system, the second listing as the representative
listing of the entity on the provider system and designating the remaining one or more remaining listing of the plurality of potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings on the provider system;  and transmitting, by the source system to
the provider system, a request to suppress the remaining one or more listings as one or more duplicate listings, the request to suppress the remaining one or more listings comprising one or more third provider-supplied external identifiers previously
assigned by the provider system to identify the remaining one or more listings, wherein the request to suppress the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings is transmitted to the provider system using a first feed;  wherein an
acknowledgement to accept the request to suppress the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings is received by the source system from the provider system using the first feed;  and wherein the at least one confirmation that the
provider system has suppressed the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings is received by the source system from the provider system using a second feed.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: updating, by the source system in a database associated with the source system, a record associated with the second listing with an indication that the second listing is the representative listing
of the entity located on a provider system, the indication comprising the second provider-supplied external identifier;  and updating one or more records associated with one or more indications that the one or more remaining listings of the plurality of
potential matching listings are one or more duplicate listings on the provider system, the one or more indications comprising the one or more third provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1, wherein, responsive to receiving an acknowledgement from the provider system that the provider system has accepted the request to suppress the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings,
receiving, by the source system from the provider system, at least one confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings, the at least one confirmation comprising the corresponding
remaining one or more third provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 1, wherein the request to suppress the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings is transmitted to the provider system using an application programming interface;  and wherein the at least one
confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings is received by the source system from the provider system using the application programming interface.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 1, wherein, responsive to receiving, by the source system from the provider system, the at least one confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or
more designated duplicate listings, verifying, by the source system on the provider system, that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 5, wherein, responsive to receiving, by the source system from the provider system, the confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings, verifying,
by the source system on the provider system, that the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 1, wherein said verifying comprises, after transmitting the request to suppress the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings, transmitting to the provider system the corresponding one or more third
provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 1, wherein said verifying comprises visiting, by the source system on the provider system, the corresponding one or more universal resource locators (URL) associated with the one or more remaining listings.
<br/><br/> 9.  The method of claim 1, wherein said verifying comprises employing, by the source system, an application programming interface (API) to search the provider system for the one or more remaining listings.
<br/><br/> 10.  The method of claim 1, wherein said verifying comprises receiving one or more corresponding indications from the provider system that the one or more remaining listings no longer exist on the provider system.
<br/><br/> 11.  The method of claim 10, wherein the one or more corresponding indications are one or more listing not found responses.
<br/><br/> 12.  The method of claim 10, wherein said verifying comprises receiving, by the source system from the provider system, one or more corresponding universal resource locator redirected responses comprising one or more universal resource locators
associated with the representative listing.
<br/><br/> 13.  The method of claim 10, wherein said verifying comprises: receiving, by the source system from the provider system, a list of entries corresponding to a search results page;  and determining, by the source system, that the list of entries

<br/><br/> The present invention relates generally to Internet search methods, and more particularly, to a method and system for selecting a single accurate listing and suppressing other duplicate listings on one or more listing provider systems from a
single source system given that a publisher selects a different listing as a synchronized listing.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A consumer and/or merchant may rely heavily on services rendered via the Internet.  One such service is searchable listings provided by a search service (hereinafter, a "search provider system," "provider system," "provider site," or simply, a
"provider").  Examples of providers include "yellow pages" or "Internet yellow pages," e.g., Google.com, Amazon.com, Yahoo.com, Yelp.com, MapQuest.com, Superpages.com, etc. Searchable listings may be provided for an entity (e.g., an advertiser, a
business, an organization, a government agency, etc., e.g., users of a provider system).  Listings may include businesses, such as restaurants, people information, product information, etc. The information provided may include, for example, a name of a
person or business, addresses, telephone numbers, web site URLs, photos, videos e-mail addresses, etc. A consumer may be presented with other information about a business by either clicking anywhere in the listing, or placing a mouse pointer or finger
over a portion of the listing.
<br/><br/> Certain search service providers, such as Google.com, WhitePages.com, MapQuest.com, provide some or all of the requested information in alphabetical, "most visited," or distance order (e.g., distance from a location that the consumer entered for
a search or a distance from a location of the search provider).  A merchant may wish to ensure that information provided in the search results is correct, so that a consumer may find a listing when searching in her local area, and if the consumer does
choose to call or visit a business, the consumer is provided with correct information.  Furthermore, a merchant may desire to maximize the chance that a consumer will select a listing of the merchant from among those returned.  The listing may be
displayed higher in the search results and/or be featured in a more prominent and attractive fashion.  The ordering of the listings is sometimes influenced by the extent to which content is available for the listing.  Further still, the merchant may
desire to maximize the probability that a consumer that views additional information about a business will have a favorable impression of the business.
<br/><br/> The above goals may be achieved by maximizing the presence and quality of content associated with a listing.  The merchant associated with a listing may desire to be listed with multiple search services.  Unfortunately, there is no one central
database that contains listings of locations of all businesses from which providers may source their listings.  Frequently, a business location of a merchant may be represented multiple times on a provider site (i.e., duplicate listings).  FIG. 1 shows
one example of a screen shot illustrating duplicate listings for a location of a business.  Consumers are increasingly relying on mobile applications, more personalized recommendation sites (e.g., Yelp, Foursquare, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> etc.) or more
vertical-specific sites (e.g., TripAdvisor, OpenTable, etc.) to discover locations of businesses.  If the consumer encounters duplicate listings with incorrect data, the consumer may become confused and frustrated.  The consumer may choose to ignore the
listings in their entirety, leading to lost business for merchants who have duplicate listings.
<br/><br/> A search service provider may combine local business listings from a variety of data sources (e.g., yellow pages publishers and data aggregators).  If a business location is not consistently represented across the data sources, or is represented
multiple times, then the location of the business may not rank highly in search page results for certain search terms input by a consumer.  As a way to obtain revenue, many search provider web sites permit a merchant to respond to consumer reviews with
respect to business listings of the merchant.  If a business location associated with a merchant is represented multiple times on a provider site, then it may become difficult for the merchant to respond to consumer reviews across multiple listings of
one location of a business of the merchant.
<br/><br/> Duplicate listings for one location of a business may be created in many ways.  Duplicate listings may be created by merchants, by consumers, by sources that providers use to build their location databases, by the providers themselves, and/or by
common crawling practices that providers may employ to build their location databases.
<br/><br/> Duplicate listings may be created by employees of a business when multiple employees of the business independently create a listing for the same location of the business on a provider web site.  This may happen when the business does not have a
cohesive location strategy, as may occur in a large company with many locations.
<br/><br/> Consumers may create duplicate listings when a provider crowd-sources their location database.  On such provider web sites (e.g., <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Foursquare, Yelp, etc.), consumers are able to create new representations of physical locations.  For
example, a consumer can create a new listing prior to viewing it on Foursquare, Yelp, or <b><i>Facebook</i></b>.  For several reasons, multiple consumers may create duplicate listings for the same location on the provider web site.
<br/><br/> Search providers often obtain location information for business listings from business listing aggregators, which are companies that gather information from a variety of sources to determine a name, address, phone number(s), etc., of a business. Business listing aggregators may license the obtained business listing information to other search providers.  Unfortunately, business listing aggregators are often not accurate with respect to matching records from various sources, and during the
matching process, more duplicates may be created (and thus causing duplicates downstream at the provider level).
<br/><br/> At the provider level, providers typically combine various sources (from merchants, consumers, and aggregators) into one consolidated location database.  Unfortunately, providers may not have accurate matching and data cleanup processes, leading
to the creation of duplicate listings.
<br/><br/> Frequently, aggregators and providers crawl the Web to obtain location information.  However, due to the imperfect information on the Web, an aggregator and a provider may cross-contaminate each other's location databases.  For example, an
aggregator may inadvertently transmit duplicate listings to a provider, and subsequently the aggregator fixes the duplicate problem.  However, because both the aggregator and the provider rely on web-crawling as a source of information, and the provider
may have obtained duplicate information by web-crawling the web site of the aggregator before the aggregator has removed the duplicate information, duplicate listings may re-occur on the web sites of both the aggregator and the provider.  The cycle
continues!
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> As used herein, the term "listing identification data" may refer to one or more of the following three types of content employed by examples of the present disclosure to identify or define a location of an entity (e.g., a business, organization,
government agency, etc.): (a) "basic content", e.g., a name, street address, and telephone number associated with the location of the entity (e.g., a business, organization, government agency, etc.); (b) "enhanced static content," e.g., content that does
not change frequently and is often cached (e.g., a web site universal resource locator (URL), a business description, business hours, e-mail addresses, photos, videos, etc.); and (3) "enhanced real-time content", e.g., content that changes frequently and
needs to be served to a user in real-time (e.g., structured lists and featured messages, etc.).  Enhanced real-time content may also include a "structured list".  A structured list refers to a type of enhanced content, e.g., lists of formatted real-world
information that follows a distinct, easily recognizable pattern.  Examples of structured listings may include, but are not limited to, restaurant menu lists, biographies of employees ("bios"), lists of products and services, lists of events, etc. In an
example, a listing may include at least basic content and enhanced static content and/or enhanced real-time content (together an "enhanced listing").
<br/><br/> The above-described problems are addressed and a technical solution is achieved in the art by providing a method and system for suppressing a duplicate listing given a known representative (synchronized) listing on a provider system from a
source system.  The source system may select a representative listing of an entity (e.g., a business, an organization, a government agency, etc.) located on a provider system.  The representative listing may comprise first identification data and a first
provider-supplied external identifier.  Accordingly, the source system may search the provider system for additional listings having identification data matching the first identification data.  The source system may receive from the provider system a
potential matching listing having identification data matching the first identification data and having a second provider-supplied external identifier that differs from the first provider-supplied external identifier.  The source system may designate the
potential matching listing as a duplicate listing.  The source system may transmit a request to the provider system to suppress the designated duplicate listing on the provider system.  The request may comprise the second provider-supplied external
identifier.
<br/><br/> In an example, responsive to the source system receiving an acknowledgement from the provider system that the provider system has accepted the request to suppress the designated duplicate listing in view of the second provider-supplied external
identifier, the source system may receive from the provider system a confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the designated duplicate listing.
<br/><br/> In an example, in response to the source system receiving from the provider system the confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the designated duplicate listing, the source system may verify that the designated duplicate listing has
been suppressed on the provider system.  In one example, verifying that the designated duplicate listing has been suppressed on the provider system may comprise the source system visiting the address provided by a universal resource locator (URL)
associated with the designated duplicate listing on the provider system.  In another example, verifying that the designated duplicate listing has been suppressed on the provider system may comprise the source system employing an application programming
interface (API) to search the provider system for the designated duplicate listing.
<br/><br/> In an example, the source system may receive from the provider system an indication from the provider system that the designated duplicate listing no longer exists on the provider system.  In one example, the indication may be a listing not
found response.  In another example, the source system may receive from the provider system a universal resource locator redirected response comprising a universal resource locator associated with representative listing.  In another example, the
indication may comprise the source system receiving from the provider system a list of entries.  The provider system may determine that the list of entries does not contain the designated duplicate listing.
<br/><br/> In an example, the source system may receive from the provider system a receipt file as a confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the designated duplicate listing.  The receipt file may comprise a record corresponding to the
designated duplicate listing, the record comprising the second provider-supplied external identifier, a universal resource locator associated with the designated duplicate listing, and an indication that the designated duplicate listing is not in service
on the provider system.
<br/><br/> The above-described problems are addressed and a technical solution is achieved in the art by providing a method and system for suppressing a duplicate listing by first determining a representative (synchronized) listing on a provider system
from a source system and then designating any other corresponding listings for a location as duplicate listings.  The source system may receive from a user associated with an entity initial identification data of a listing related to the entity (e.g., a
business, an organization, a government agency, etc.).  The source system may search a provider system for one or more listings having identification data matching the initial identification data.  The source system may receive from the provider system a
plurality of potential matching listings having identification data matching the initial identification data.  Each listing of the plurality of potential matching listings may have a corresponding confidence score assigned by the source system.  Each
listing of the plurality of potential matching listings may have a corresponding provider-supplied external identifier assigned by the provider system.  The source system may designate a representative listing of the entity located on a provider system
from among the plurality of potential matching listings.  The representative listing may be the listing having the highest confidence score assigned by the source system.  The source system may designate the remaining one or more potential matching
listings of the plurality of potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings.  The source system may transmit to the provider system a request to synchronize the representative listing having the highest confidence score assigned by the
source system as the representative listing of the entity on the provider system.  The request may comprise a first provider-supplied external identifier.
<br/><br/> Responsive to the source system receiving a confirmation from the provider system that the provider system has synchronized the representative listing having the highest confidence score assigned by the source system as the representative
listing of the entity on the provider system, the response comprising the first provider-supplied external identifier, the source system may transmit to the provider system a request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings as
one or more duplicate listings.  The request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings may comprise the remaining one or more provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In one example, before transmitting the request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings, the source system may verify that a plurality of fields associated with the confirmed representative listing are correct.
<br/><br/> In an example, before the request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings, the source system may update in the database associated with the source system, a record associated with the listing having the highest
confidence score with an indication that the listing having the highest confidence score is the representative listing of the entity located on a provider system.  The indication may comprise the first provider-supplied external identifier.
<br/><br/> In an example, the request to synchronize the representative listing having the highest confidence score may be transmitted by the source system to the provider system using an application programming interface.  An acknowledgement to accept the
request to synchronize the representative listing having the highest confidence score may be received by the source system from the provider system using an application programming interface.  The confirmation that the provider system has synchronized
the representative listing may be received by the source system from the provider system using the application programming interface.
<br/><br/> In an example, the request to synchronize the representative listing having the highest confidence score may be transmitted by the source system to the provider system using a first feed.  An acknowledgement to accept the request to synchronize
the representative listing having the highest confidence score may be received by the source system from the provider system using the first feed.  The confirmation that the provider system has synchronized the representative listing may be received by
the source system from the provider system using a second feed.
<br/><br/> In an example, responsive to the source system receiving an acknowledgement from the provider system that the provider system has accepted the request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more duplicate
listings, the source system may receive from the provider system at least one confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings.  The at least one confirmation may
comprise the corresponding remaining one or more provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In one example, responsive to the source system receiving from the provider the at least one confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more designated duplicate listings,
the source system may verify on the provider system that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system.  In one example, the source system verifying that the remaining one or more potential matching listings
have been suppressed on the provider system may comprise, after transmitting the request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings, transmitting to the provider system the corresponding remaining one or more provider-supplied
external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In one example, verifying may comprise visiting, by the source system on the provider system, the corresponding one or more universal resource locators (URL) associated with the one or more designated duplicate listings.  In one example,
verifying may comprise the source system employing an application programming interface (API) to search the provider system for the one or more designated duplicate listings.
<br/><br/> In one example, verifying may comprise the source system receiving one or more corresponding indications from the provider system that the one or more designated duplicate listings no longer exist on the provider system.  The one or more
corresponding indications may be one or more listing not found responses.  In an example, verifying may comprise the source system receiving from the provider system one or more corresponding universal resource locator redirected responses comprising one
or more universal resource locators associated with representative listing.  In one example, verifying may comprise the source system receiving from the provider system a list of entries corresponding to a search results page.  The source system may
determine that the list of entries does not contain the one or more remaining listings.
<br/><br/> In one example, the source system may assign a confidence score to a potential matching listing.  The confidence score may be based the one or more fields of the identification data associated with the potential matching listing.  In one
example, responsive to the source system assigning the confidence score to the potential matching listing equal to or above a first threshold value, the source system may mark the potential matching listing as a confirmed matching listing.  The source
system may perform the designation of the potential matching listing as the duplicate listing.  In one example, responsive to the source system assigning the confidence score to the potential matching listing lower than a second threshold value below the
threshold first value, the source system may discard for further consideration the potential matching listing as non-matching listing.  In one example, responsive to the source system assigning the confidence score to the potential matching listing equal
to or above a second threshold value below the first threshold value, the source system may mark the potential matching listing as a probable matching listing.
<br/><br/> In one example, responsive to the source system designating the potential matching listing as probable matching listing, the source system may present the probable matching listing to at least one of a user associated with the entity (e.g., the
merchant) or a human operator associated with the source system.  The source system may receive from the at least one of the user associated with the entity (e.g., the merchant) or the human operator associated with the source system, a designation of
the probable matching listing as a non-matching listing.  The source system may mark in the database associated with the source system, a record associated with the potential matching listing with an indication that the potential matching listing is a
non-matching listing.  The source system may be operable to remove the non-matching listing from future consideration in searches for duplicate listings.
<br/><br/> In one example, the source system may receive from at least one of the user associated with the entity (e.g., the merchant) or the human operator associated with the source system, a designation of the probable matching listing as a confirmed
matching listing.  The source system may mark in the database associated with the source system, the record associated with the potential matching listing with an indication that the potential matching listing is a confirmed matching listing.  The source
system may perform the designation of the potential matching listing as the duplicate listing.
<br/><br/> The above-described problems are addressed and a technical solution is achieved in the art by providing a method and system for suppressing a duplicate listing by first determining a representative (synchronized) listing on a provider system and
designating any other corresponding listings for a location as duplicate listings, but the provider system selects a different listing as the synchronized listing rather than the one selected by the source system.  The source system may receive initial
identification data of a listing related to an entity.  The source system may search a provider system for one or more listings having identification data matching the initial identification data.  The source system may receive from the provider system a
plurality of potential matching listings having identification data matching the initial identification data.  Each listing of the plurality of potential matching listings may have a corresponding confidence score assigned by the source system.  Each
listing of the plurality of potential matching listings may have a corresponding provider-supplied external identifier assigned by the provider system.  The source system may designate a representative listing of the entity located on a provider system
from among the plurality of potential matching listings.  The representative listing may be the listing having the highest confidence score assigned by the source system.  The source system may transmit to the provider system a request to synchronize the
representative listing having the highest confidence score assigned by the source system as the representative listing of the entity on the provider system.  The request may comprise a first provider-supplied external identifier.  The source system may
receive from the provider system an indication that a second listing of the plurality of potential matching listings has been selected by the provider system as the representative listing of the entity on the provider system.  The response may comprise a
second provider-supplied external identifier.  The source system may re-designate the second listing as the representative listing of the entity on the provider system and may designate the remaining one or more remaining listing of the plurality of
potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings on the provider system.  The source system may transmit to the provider system a request to suppress the remaining one or more listings as one or more duplicate listings.  The request to
suppress the remaining one or more listings may comprise one or more third provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In an example, responsive to the source system receiving an acknowledgement from the provider system that the provider system has accepted the request to suppress the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings, the source
system may receive from the provider system at least one confirmation that the provider has suppressed the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings, the at least one confirmation comprising the corresponding remaining one or more
third provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In an example, responsive to the source system receiving from the provider system, the at least one confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more designated duplicate
listings, the source system may verify on the provider system that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system.  In an example, responsive to the source system receiving from the provider system the
confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings, the source system may verify on the provider system that the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings have
been suppressed on the provider system.
<br/><br/> In one example, verifying that the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system may comprise, after the source system transmits the request to suppress the one or more remaining
listings as one or more duplicate listings, the source system may transmit to the provider system the corresponding one or more third provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In one example, verifying that the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system may comprise visiting, by the source system on the provider system, the corresponding one or more
universal resource locators (URL) associated with the one or more remaining listings.  In one example, verifying may comprise the source system receiving one or more corresponding indications from the provider system that the one or more remaining
listings no longer exist on the provider system.
<br/><br/> In one example, the one or more corresponding indications may be one or more listing not found responses.
<br/><br/> In one example, verifying may comprise receiving, by the source system from the provider system, one or more corresponding universal resource locator redirected responses comprising one or more universal resource locators associated with the
representative listing.  In one example, verifying may comprise receiving, by the source system from the provider system, a list of entries corresponding to a search results page.  The source system may determine that the list of entries does not contain
the one or more remaining listings.
<br/><br/> The above-described problems are addressed and a technical solution is achieved in the art by providing a method and system for suppressing a duplicate listing in response to a human triggering a suppression of a list of no longer valid listings
on a plurality of provider systems.  The source system may receive from at least one of the users associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant) or the human operator associated with the source system, an indication to suppress all listings associated
with the entity on one or more provider systems.  The indication may comprise identification data of the entity and an indication that the identification data of the entity is no longer valid.  The source system may retrieve from a database associated
with the source system, a list of one or more provider systems associated with the source system and having at least one listing corresponding to the entity.
<br/><br/> For each provider system in the list of one or more provider systems: the source system may search the provider system for listings having identification data matching the identification data of the entity.  The source system may receive from
the provider system, one or more matching listings having identification data matching the identification data of the entity.  Each listing of the one or more matching listings may have a corresponding provider-supplied external identifier assigned by
the provider system.  The source system may transmit to the provider system a request to suppress the one or more matching listings on the provider system.  The request to suppress the one or more matching listings may comprise a list of the one or more
corresponding provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In an example, responsive to the source system receiving an acknowledgement from the provider system that the provider system has accepted the request to suppress the one or more matching listings in view of the one or more corresponding
provider-supplied external identifiers, the source system may receive from the provider system a confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the one or more matching listings.
<br/><br/> In an example, responsive to the source system receiving from the provider the confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more designated duplicate listings, the source
system may verify on the provider system that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system.  In an example, verifying that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider
system may comprise, after the source system transmits the request to the provider system to suppress the one or more matching listings, the source system may transmit to the provider system the list of the one or more corresponding provider-supplied
external identifiers.  In one example, verifying that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system may comprise the source system visiting on the provider system, the one or more universal resource locators
(URL) associated with the one or more matching listings.  In one example, verifying that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system may comprise employing, by the source system, an application programming
interface (API) to search the provider system for the one or more matching listings.  In an example, verifying that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system may comprise the source system receiving an
indication from the provider system that the one or more matching listings no longer exist on the provider system.
<br/><br/> In an example, the indication may be one or more listing not found responses.  In one example, verifying that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system may comprise the source system receiving from
the provider system a search results page.  The source system may determine that the search results page does not contain the one or more matching listings.
<br/><br/> In an example, the source system receiving a confirmation that the provider system has suppressed the one or more matching listings may comprise receiving a receipt file.  The receipt file comprises one or more records corresponding to the one
or more matching listings.  Each record of the one or more records may comprise a provider-supplied external identifier associated a corresponding matching listing, a universal resource locator associated with the corresponding matching listing, and an
indication that the corresponding matching listing is not in service on the provider system.
<br/><br/> In one example, the source system may receive from the at least one of the users associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant) or the human operator associated with the source system, identification data of a replacement entity for delivery of
an enhanced listing to a plurality of provider systems.  For each provider system of the plurality of provider systems: the source system may transmit to the provider system identification data of the replacement entity and the enhanced listing to the
provider system without a provider-supplied external identifier as an indication to the provider system to create a listing using the enhanced content.
<br/><br/> The above-described problems are addressed and a technical solution is achieved in the art by providing a method and system for suppressing a duplicate listing on a plurality of provider systems.  The source system may receive from a user
associated with an entity (e.g., a merchant), an indication that a listing related to an entity is a duplicate listing of the entity on a provider system.  The source system may search the provider system for the listing, the listing having
identification data.  The source system may receive from the provider system the listing having the identification data.  The listing may not be marked by the source system as a representative listing of the entity located on a provider system, nor be
marked by the source system as a duplicate listing of the representative listing for other entities.  The source system may designate the listing as a probable matching listing of the entity on the provider system.  The source system may transmit to a
human operator associated with the source system, the probable matching listing for review.
<br/><br/> In one example, the human operator may employ the source system to search the provider system for the probable matching listing.  The human operator associated with the source system may receive an indication that the probable matching listing
does not exist on the provider system.  The source system may receive from the human operator associated with the source system, an indication of a rejection of the probable matching listing as the listing of the entity on the provider system.  The
source system may transmit to the user associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant) the indication of the rejection.
<br/><br/> In one example, the human operator associated with the source system may search the database associated with the provider system for the probable matching listing.  The human operator associated with the source system may receive from the source
system, an indication that the probable matching listing exists on the provider system.  The probable matching listing may be marked on the provider system as a representative listing or a duplicate listing associated with another entity on the provider
system.  The source system may receive from the human operator associated with the source system, an indication of a rejection of the probable matching listing as the listing of the entity on a provider system.  The source system may transmit to the user
associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant), the indication of the rejection.
<br/><br/> In one example, the human operator associated with the source system may search the provider system for the probable matching listing.  The human operator associated with the source system may receive from the source system, an indication that
the probable matching listing exists on the provider system.  The probable matching listing may be neither marked on the provider system as a representative listing nor be marked as duplicate listing associated with another entity on the provider system. The source system may receive from the human operator associated with the source system, an indication of a rejection of the probable matching listing as the listing of the entity on a provider system.  The source system may transmit to the user
associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant), the indication of the rejection.
<br/><br/> The above-described problems are addressed and a technical solution is achieved in the art by providing a method and system for suppressing a duplicate listing on a plurality of provider systems.  The source system may receive from a user
associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant), a listing no longer associated with an entity on a provider system.  The source system may search the provider system for the listing, the listing having identification data.  The source system may receive
from the provider system, the listing having the identification data.  The listing may not be marked by the source system as a representative listing of the entity located on a provider system nor marked by the source system as a duplicate listing of the
representative listing for other entities.  The source system may designate the listing as a probable matching listing of the entity on the provider system.  The source system may transmit to a human operator associated with the source system, the
probable matching listing for review.
<br/><br/> In one example, the human operator associated with the source system may employ the source system to search the provider system for the probable matching listing.  The human operator associated with the source system may receive an indication
that the probable matching listing does not exist on the provider system.  The source system may receive from the human operator associated with the source system, an indication of a rejection of the probable matching listing as the listing of the entity
on the provider system.  The source system may transmit to the user associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant), the indication of the rejection.
<br/><br/> In one example, the human operator associated with the source system may employ the source system to search the provider system for the probable matching listing.  The human operator associated with the source system may receive an indication
that the probable matching listing exists on the provider system.  The probable matching listing may be marked on the provider system as a representative listing or a duplicate listing associated with another entity on the provider system.  The source
system may receive from the human operator associated with the source system, an indication of a rejection of the probable matching listing as the listing of the entity on a provider system.  The source system may transmit to the user associated with an
entity (e.g., the merchant), the indication of the rejection.
<br/><br/> In an example, the human operator associated with the source system may employ the source system to search the provider system for the probable matching listing.  The human operator associated with the source system may receive an indication
that the probable matching listing exists on the provider system.  The probable matching listing may neither be marked on the provider system as a representative listing, nor be marked as duplicate listing associated with another entity on the provider
system.  The source system may receive from the human operator associated with the source system an indication of a rejection of the probable matching listing as the listing of the entity on a provider system.  The source system may transmit to the user
associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant) the indication of the rejection. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> In examples of the present disclosure, merchants may have their business listed in the so-called "organic search results" on a large number of directories (including Web sites, mobile apps, etc.) through a single product/system with little or no
duplicate listing are provided.  As used herein, the term "organic search results" refers to, but is not limited to, listings on search engine results pages that appear because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to their being
advertisements.  In contrast, non-organic search results may include pay per click advertising.
<br/><br/> A merchant is permitted to list promotional material comprising enhanced content associated with a listing through, among other things, highlighted content in search results and more complete content in the business profile on the service
provider.  In some embodiments, a universal resource locator (URL) is provided to permit the merchant to see their promoted listing on each search service provider's Web site.  The merchant is permitted to update their information (e.g., when they move
or when their phone number changes) and enhance their listing (e.g., by adding or modifying photos, text descriptions, special offers, hours, menus, bios, products and services, events, etc., i.e., enhanced content) from a single point substantially in
real-time or near real-time.
<br/><br/> The term "computer" or "computer platform" is intended to include any data processing device, such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a mainframe computer, a server, a handheld device, a digital signal processor (DSP),
an embedded processor (an example of which is described in connection with FIG. 19 hereinbelow), or any other device able to process data.  The computer/computer platform is configured to include one or more microprocessors communicatively connected to
one or more non-transitory computer-readable media and one or more networks.  The term "communicatively connected" is intended to include any type of connection, whether wired or wireless, in which data may be communicated.  The term "communicatively
connected" is intended to include, but not limited to, a connection between devices and/or programs within a single computer or between devices and/or separate computers over a network.  The term "network" is intended to include, but not limited to, OTA
(over-the-air transmission, ATSC, DVB-T), packet-switched networks (TCP/IP, e.g., the Internet), satellite (microwave, MPEG transport stream or IP), direct broadcast satellite, analog cable transmission systems (RF), and digital video transmission
systems (ATSC, HD-SDI, HDMI, DVI, VGA), etc.
<br/><br/> The one or more computer readable media may be used for storing the instructions to be executed by the one or more processors, including an optional operating system, such as the Windows or the Linux operating system.  The computer readable
media may further be used for the storing and retrieval of data in one or more databases.  The computer readable media may include a combination of volatile memory, such as RAM memory, and non-volatile memory, such as flash memory, optical disk(s),
and/or hard disk(s).  Portions of the data stored in the computer readable media may be provided by one or more human users at one or more monitors.  The monitor (s) may be equipped with a keyboard and a mouse for selecting objects of interest by the
user or for inputting data.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 2A and 2B are screen shots of enhanced listings.  The listings 10 (e.g., Gold's Gym) may include, but are not limited to, a business name 12, address 14, telephone number 16, a link to a website for the business 18, user review information
20, a pointer to a map 22 of the location of the business, the business location on a map 24, a promotional message 26, and a list of structured listings 25, which may include, but are not limited to, menus 27a, bios 27b, products and services 27c,
events 27d, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3A depicts a conventional high level architecture managing listings on multiple search service providers 28a-28n.  As described hereinabove, the merchant 38 that desires to enter a listing or correct an existing listing needs to do so with
each of the search service providers 28a-28n (e.g., Google, Yahoo, Yelp, etc.) directly and separately, thereby needlessly duplicating effort that is substantially prone to errors accumulated over time, particularly the creation of duplicate listing as
described hereinabove.  FIG. 3B depicts a high level system architecture for managing enhanced listings on multiple search service providers 28a-28n from a single source system 30, according to examples of the present disclosure.  In contrast to the
architecture of FIG. 2A, in FIG. 2B, the merchant 38 needs only to access the single source system 30 for entering a common listing that is propagated from the single source system 30 in real or near-real time to the search service providers 28a-28n. 
The single source system 30 may be employed to suppress duplicate listings when and where they may arise.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 depicts a system architecture of a single source system 30 for providing enhanced listings to multiple search service providers 34a-34n and for suppressing duplicate listings on web sites associated with the multiple search service
providers 34a-34n.  The system 30 may be executed on one or more computer platforms 32, 34a-34n, interconnected by one or more networks 36, which may include the Internet.  A central computer platform 32 (hereinafter "the source system 32") include a
plurality of software modules 102, 104, 106, 107, 110, 114, 118, 154 that are communicatively connected with a merchant 38, one or more human operators 40, a plurality of service provider computer platforms 34a-34n (hereinafter "the provider system(s)
34a-34n"), and a system database 42.  Each of the service provider computer platforms 34a-34n provides a plurality of modules 108, 112, 116, 150, 152 with which the source system 32 interacts for carrying out operations and providing result data between
the source system 32 and the service provider computer platforms 34a-34n.
<br/><br/> A plurality of provider search application programming interfaces (APIs) 108 may permit the source system 32 to search for matching listings as part of a matching process.  The provider API searcher 106 may be configured to accommodate existing
provider search APIs 108 provided that an existing provider search API 108 meets system standards.  In certain circumstances, a provider system (e.g., 34a) may need to modify their search provider API 108 so that it may operate properly with the source
system 32.  The provider listing update APIs 150 may be configured to receive information about new and updated listings to display from the listing delivery engine 114.  Should a provider system (e.g., 34a) be unable to supply a provider listing update
API 150, the provider system (e.g., 34a) may supply a periodic feed receiver 112 for processing periodic data updates generated by the source system 32 containing listings that should contain enhanced content.  These are modules designed by each of the
provider system (e.g., 34a).  They are designed to accommodate a source system enhanced listings format.  The provider directory site/mobile app/etc. 116 is a module that serves the directory sites with which a consumer 46 interacts, e.g., MapQuest.com,
the MapQuest iPhone app, etc.
<br/><br/> The modules 108, 112, 116, 150, 152 are, in turn, communicatively connected to a plurality of user devices running some form of communication software, preferably in a consumer Web browser 120 over a network, such as the Internet 36, and a
provider database 44a-44n.  In an example, the computer platform 32 may be communicatively connected to each of the plurality of user devices via a PowerListings JavaScript 118 running in the consumer Web browser 120 when enhanced content is pulled
directly from a consumer Web browser 120 or device, rather than passing through a provider system (e.g., 34a).  In such circumstances, the PowerListings JavaScript 118 (either provided by the system provider or written by the provider system (e.g., 34a)
and included within a Web page) may be configured to call the real-time content server 110 and obtain the needed enhanced content.  Alternatively, the PowerListings JavaScript 118 may be replaced with, for example, a mobile application or some other
non-Web application.  In such circumstances, the mobile or external application may communicate directly with the real-time content server 110 to obtain the real-time content updates.  However, in an example, a request typically passes through a provider
system (e.g., 34a) rather than having a direct connection between the application running on the consumer's device and the real-time content server 110.
<br/><br/> In an example, the PowerListings Web application 102 may receive listing identification data provided by the merchant 38 associated with a business of a merchant 38 and an identification of a provider system (e.g., 34a) from the merchant 38. 
The listing identification data provided by the merchant 38, may include, but is not limited to, a business name, street address, and telephone number.  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may transmit a message to a provider API searcher 106 to
attempt to find one or more listings matching the received listing identification data to listing data that may be located in the provider database (e.g., 008a) associated with the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The provider API searcher 106 may invoke a
provider API 108 with the listing identification data supplied by the merchant 38.  The provider API 108 of the provider system 34a may return potential matching listings to the provider API searcher 106.  The provider API searcher 106 may return
potential matching listings to the power listings backend coordinator 104.  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may employ a method to determine which of the returned results matches the listing identification data supplied by the merchant 38, if
any, and a measure of confidence of a match for the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> A set of representations of listings associated with a merchant 38 (hereinafter "potential matching listings") may be returned by the provider search API (108).  Each listing of the plurality of potential matching listings may have a
corresponding external provider-supplied identifier (or provider-supplied identifier) associated with the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may be configured to categorize the potential matching listings into three
categories based on a confidence score assigned by the power listings backend coordinator 104: a confirmed matching listing, a probable matching listing, or a non-matching listing.
<br/><br/> In an example, if the confidence score assigned to the potential matching listing is above or equal to a first level of confidence, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may categorize the potential matching listing as a confirmed matching
listing.  If the confidence score assigned to the potential matching listing is above or equal to a second level of confidence below the first level of confidence, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may categorize the potential matching listing
as a probable matching listing.  If the confidence score assigned to the potential matching listing is below the second level of confidence the power listings backend coordinator 104 may categorize the potential matching listing as a non-matching listing
(i.e., listings having confidence scores so low that they obviously do not represent the merchant location).  Non-matching listing are automatically discarded from further consideration by the power listings backend coordinator 104.
<br/><br/> To calculate the confidence score, in one example, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may normalize the core listing information supplied by the merchant 38 and returned with each potential matching listing.  Then the power listings
backend coordinator 104 may assign up to one point for similarity of each of the following data fields: name, address (including city, state, and postal code), and primary phone number.  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may also assign points
for matches of non-primary phone numbers and merchant URL.  If the potential matching listing has at least three points--which can happen only if the name, address, and primary phone number match exactly, or if two of the three match and the other fields
match exactly--the listing is considered to be so perfect a match that the potential matching listing may be recorded as a confirmed matching listing without merchant verification (i.e., equal to or above a first level of confidence).  If potential
matching listing has a match of at least one point, then the potential matching listing may be considered a probable matching listing and can be presented to the merchant 38 and/or a human system operator 40 as such; otherwise, the potential matching
listing is considered to be a non-matching listing.
<br/><br/> If a potential matching listing is categorized as a confirmed matching listing or a probable matching listing, the power listings backend coordinator 104 records and associates the provider-supplied "external identifier" or "external ID" or
"identifier" for the listing along with returned listing data (e.g., the name, address, telephone number, and URL associated with the listing found on the provider system 34a) in the system database 42.  As used herein, an external identifier or an
external ID or provider-supplied external identifier refers to a unique identifier that the provider system (e.g., 34a) assigns to a listing for their own purposes.  This contrasts with a system-provided "listing identifier" or "Listing ID" that is a
unique identifier assigned by the source system 32 to the same listing on a per provider/per listing (e.g., per business physical location) basis.  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may have associated the provider-supplied external identifier
of confirmed matching listings and probable matching listings with a corresponding system-supplied listing identifier in the system database 42 for the provider system (e.g., 34a).  If the power listings backend coordinator 104 categorized the potential
matching listing as a non-matching listing, then the non-matching listing may be discarded with no recording of its external identifier in the system database 42 and no association is made with a system-supplied listing identifier.  Accordingly, the
power listings backend coordinator 104 may to remove the non-matching listings, retain the confirmed matching listings and probable matching listings, and record the ranking of the confirmed matching listings and probable matching listings according to
their confidence scores in the system database 42.
<br/><br/> After the categorization and ranking process has been completed, a location of a business of the merchant may have no representation of a listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a), exactly one representation on the provider system (e.g., 34a),
or multiple representations on the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> The merchant 38 may instruct the power listings web application 102 to submit a listing order request using the listing identification data (e.g., basic content, along with enhanced static content) provided by the merchant 38.  When there is no
representation of a listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a), in order to avoid the possible creation of duplicate listings, the listing order request may be confirmed and approved by the merchant 38 and/or the human operator 40.  If the power listings
web application 102 receives a confirmation by merchant 38 and/or the human operator 40, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may instruct the listings delivery engine 114 to submit a listing order request (along with the basic and enhanced static
content entered by the merchant 38) to the provider system (e.g., 34a) without a provider-supplied external identifier for the listing.
<br/><br/> When there is exactly one representation of a listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a) and the listing identification data (e.g., basic content, along with enhanced static content) provided by the merchant 38 is categorized as a confirmed
matching listing, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may instruct the listings delivery engine 114 to submit the listing order request (along with the basic and enhanced static content entered by the merchant 38) to the provider system (e.g.,
34a) with no confirmation by the merchant 38 or the human operator 40 with a provider-supplied external identifier for the listing.  If the listing identification data (e.g., basic content, along with enhanced static content) provided by the merchant 38
is categorized as a probable matching listing, the listing order request may be confirmed and approved by the merchant 38 and/or the human operator 40.  If the power listings web application 102 receives a confirmation by merchant 38 and/or the human
operator 40, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may instruct the listings delivery engine 114 to submit the listing order request (along with the basic and enhanced static content entered by the merchant 38) to the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> When there are multiple representations of a listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the power listings backend coordinator 104 may instruct the listings delivery engine 114 to deliver all representations categorized as confirmed matching
listings (including duplicates) to the provider system (e.g., 34a).  If the multiple representations include one or more probable matching listings, then the one or more probable matching listings may be confirmed and approved by the merchant 38 and/or
the human operator 40 before the power listings backend coordinator 104 instructs the listings delivery engine 114 to deliver the one or more probable matching listings (including duplicates) to the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> When the power listings web application 102 categorizes the listing identification data as a non-matching listing, indicating that there is no representation of a listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the power listings web application 102
provides the merchant with an indication that the system 32 has found no matching listing corresponding to the listing identification data provided by the merchant 38 on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The power listings web application 102 provides
the merchant 38 with the option of searching the provider system (e.g., 34a) using the provider search API 108 associated with the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The provider search API 108 may return no listings to the power listings web application 102,
indicating to the merchant 38 that there is no matching listing (as indicated by the merchant 38) on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The provider search API 108 may return one or more listings to the power listings web application 102, indicating to
the merchant 38 that there is one or more possible matching listings on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The merchant 38 may select one best matching listing from the one or more possible matching listings as the listing to be represented on the
provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> When there is no matching listing (as indicated by the merchant 38) on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the power listings web application 102 may receive a confirmation from the merchant that there is no matching listing on the provider system
(e.g., 34a).  The power listings web application 102 may instruct the listings delivery engine 114 to submit a listing order request (along with the basic and enhanced static content entered by the merchant 38) to the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> When there is one best matching listing (as selected by the merchant 38) on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the power listings web application 102 may receive a confirmation from the merchant that there is one best matching listing (as
confirmed by the merchant 38) on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may transmit a listing order request (along with basic and enhanced static content entered by the merchant 38) for the best matching listing (as
selected by the merchant 38) to the human review web application 107 for review by the human operator 40.
<br/><br/> The power listings web application 102 may indicate a non-matching listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a), but the merchant 38 does not confirm that there is no matching listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a) within a specified period of
time (i.e., a timeout period).  According, if a timeout occurs, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may transmit the non-matching listing (e.g., the listing identification data (e.g., basic content, along with enhanced static content) entered by
the merchant 34)) to the human review web application 107 for review by the human operator 40.  The listing identification data and the non-matching categorization presented by the human review web application 107 may indicate to the human operator 40
that the system 32 cannot find a matching listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  In one example, the human review web application 107 may receive a confirmation indication from the human operator 40 indicating to the human review web application
107 that there is no matching listing found on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  Accordingly, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may instruct the listings delivery engine 114 to submit a listing order request (along with the basic and enhanced
static content entered by the merchant 38) to the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> In another example, the human review web application 107 may provide the human operator 40 with the option of searching the provider system (e.g., 34a) using the provider search API 108 associated with the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The
provider search API 108 may return no listings to the human review web application 107, indicating to the human operator 40 that there is no matching listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The provider search API 108 may return one or more listings
to the human review web application 107, indicating to the human operator 40 that there is one or more possible matching listings on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The human operator 40 may select one best matching listing from the one or more
possible matching listings as the listing to be represented on the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> When there is no matching listing (as indicated by the human operator 40) on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the human review web application 107 may receive a confirmation from the human operator 40 that there is no matching listing on the
provider system (e.g., 34a).  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may instruct the listings delivery engine 114 to submit a listing order request (along with the basic and enhanced static content entered by the human operator 40) to the provider
system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> When there is one best matching listing (as selected by the human operator 40) on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the human review web application 107 may receive a confirmation from the human operator 40 that there is one best matching listing
on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may transmit a listing order request (along with basic and enhanced static content entered by the human operator 40) for the best matching listing (as selected by the human
operator 40) to the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> If the system 32 categorizes the potential matching listing as probable matching listing for the provider system (e.g., 34a), then the merchant 38 and/or the human operator 40 needs to confirm that the probable matching listing is or is not a
confirmed matching listing.  More particularly, when the power listings backend coordinator 104 categorizes the listing identification data as a probable matching listing, indicating that there is a probable representation of a listing on the provider
system (e.g., 34a), the power listings web application 102 may provide the merchant with an indication that the system 32 has found a probable matching listing corresponding to the listing identification data provided by the merchant 38 on the provider
system (e.g., 34a).  If the merchant 38 confirms that the listing identification data for the location of the business associated with the merchant 38 is a matching listing, the power listings web application 102 may receive an indication of a
confirmation from the merchant 38.  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may instruct the listings delivery engine 114 to submit a listing order request (along with the basic and enhanced static content entered by the merchant 38) to the provider
system (e.g., 34a).  If the merchant 38 confirms that the listing identification data for the location of the business associated with the merchant 38 is a non-matching listing, the power listings web application 102 may receive an indication of a
non-confirmation from the merchant 38.  Accordingly, the power listings web application 102 provides the merchant 38 with the option of searching the provider system (e.g., 34a) using the provider search API 108 associated with the provider system (e.g.,
34a).  The provider search API 108 may return no listings to the power listings web application 102, indicating to the merchant 38 that there is no matching listing (as indicated by the merchant 38) on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The provider
search API 108 may return one or more listings to the power listings web application 102, indicating to the merchant 38 that there is one or more possible matching listings on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The merchant 38 may select one best matching
listing from the one or more possible matching listings as the listing to be represented on the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> When there is no matching listing (as indicated by the merchant 38) on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the power listings web application 102 may receive a confirmation from the merchant 38 that there is no matching listing on the provider
system (e.g., 34a).  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may instruct the listings delivery engine 114 to submit a listing order request (along with the basic and enhanced static content entered by the merchant 38) to the provider system (e.g.,
34a).
<br/><br/> When there is one best matching listing (as selected by the merchant 38) on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the power listings web application 102 may receive a confirmation from the merchant that there is one best matching listing (as
confirmed by the merchant 38) on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may transmit a listing order request (along with basic and enhanced static content entered by the merchant 38) for the best matching listing (as
selected by the merchant 38) to the human review web application 107 for review by the human operator 40.
<br/><br/> From the human review web application 107, the human operator 40 may be presented with one of the following: (1) the merchant 38 designated a categorized non-matching listing as a confirmed matching listing; (2) the merchant 38 designated a
categorize probable matching listing as confirmed matching listing; (3) the merchant 38 designated a categorize probable matching listing as a non-matching listing and had selected another listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a) as a confirmed
matching listing; or (4) the system 32 categorized a possible matching listing as a probable matching listing, but the merchant 38 did not confirm the probable matching listing as a confirmed matching listing within a timeout period.  In such
circumstances, the human operator 40 reviews the listing identification data (e.g., the basic content of name, street address, and telephone number), the static enhanced content, and the probable matching listing that the system 32 had categorized as
such or an alternative listing that the merchant had selected.
<br/><br/> In one example, the human operator 40 may confirm the probable matching listing (selected by the merchant 38 or the system 32) as a confirmed matching listing.  Accordingly, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may instruct the listings
delivery engine 114 to submit a listing order request (along with the basic and enhanced static content entered by the merchant 38) to the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> In another example, the human operator may search for and select an alternative listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a) as a more suitable matching listing for the location of the business associated with the merchant 38.  More particularly,
the human review web application 107 may provide the human operator 40 with the option of searching the provider system (e.g., 34a) using the provider search API 108 associated with the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The provider search API 108 may return
no listings to the human review web application 107, indicating to the human operator 40 that there is no matching listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The provider search API 108 may return one or more listings to the human review web
application 107, indicating to the human operator 40 that there is one or more possible matching listings on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The human operator 40 may select one best matching listing from the one or more possible matching listings as
the listing to be represented on the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> When there is no matching listing (as indicated by the human operator 40) on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the human review web application 107 may receive a confirmation from the human operator 40 that there is no matching listing on the
provider system (e.g., 34a).  Accordingly, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may instruct the listings delivery engine 114 to submit a listing order request (along with the basic and enhanced static content entered by the human operator 40) to
the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> When there is one best matching listing (as selected by the human operator 40) on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the human review web application 107 may receive a confirmation from the human operator 40 that there is one best matching listing
on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may transmit a listing order request (along with basic and enhanced static content entered by the human operator 40) for the best matching listing (as selected by the human
operator 40) to the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> In an example, the process of finding zero or more potential matching listings and selecting the best matching listing may be repeated for the remaining provider systems (e.g., 34b-34n) of the plurality of provider systems 34a-34n.  In the event
that the best matching listing selected on one provider system (e.g., 34a) does not match the best matching listing selected on another provider system (e.g., 34b), the merchant 38 and/or the human operator 40 may select one of the listings from among
the provider systems 34a-34n as the final best matching listing.  Once the final best matching listing is determined, the final best matching listing may be delivered to each of the provider sites 34a-34n either substantially simultaneously or in
selected groupings.
<br/><br/> The listings delivery engine 114 is responsible for delivering listing information to one or more of the plurality of provider systems 34a-34n.  The listings delivery engine 114 may receive listing identification data (basic and enhanced static
content entered by the merchant 38 or the human operator 40) corresponding to the final best matching listing (new as input by the merchant 38 or human operator 40 or selected from among the provider systems 34a-34n) and an identifier that indicates
whether or not there is a matching listing (as indicated by the presence or absence of a provider-supplied external identifier associated with the final best matching listing in the system database 42, and an identifier of the provider system (e.g.,
34a).  The listings delivery engine 114 then transmits this data to the one or more of the plurality of provider systems 34a-34n using a deliver mechanism supported by the provider listing update APIs or periodic feed receiver module 112.  The delivery
method varies (via a real-time update API or via a periodic feed file described below) depending on the capability of a provider system (e.g., 34a).  As noted above, when there is no match for a location of a business associate with a merchant 38, a
listing is to be created on the provider system (e.g., 34a) as indicated by the absence in the data to be transmitted of an associated provider-supplied external identifier.  When there is a final best matching listing for a location of a business
associate with a merchant 38, a listing is to be updated on the provider system (e.g., 34a), which is indicated by the presence in the data to be transmitted of an associated provider-supplied external identifier.  The listing delivery engine 114 may be
configured to receive a receipt file from the provider system (e.g., 34a) that indicates success or failure of the creation of a listing or an update to the listing to be described hereinbelow.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating an example of a method 500 for providing enhanced listings to multiple search service providers 34a-34n from the single source system 32 when a single listing is designated either automatically by the source
system 32, or by one or both of the merchant 38 or the human operator 40 as the synchronized (e.g., selected) listing to be propagated to the provider systems 34a34n.
<br/><br/> The method 500 may be performed by the source system 32 of FIG. 4 and may comprise hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device), or a combination
thereof.  In one example, the method 500 is performed by processing logic (not shown) of the source system 32 of FIG. 5.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 5, at block 505, the source system 32 may receive listing identification data from a merchant 38.  At block 510, the source system 32 may transmit listing identification data to one or more of the provider systems 34a-34n.  At
block 515, the source system 32 may receive zero or more possible matching listings are from the one or more provider systems 34a-34n.  At block 520, if there is at least one returned possible matching listing, at block 525, the source system 32 may
match the at least one possible matching listing to the listing identification data based on a measure of confidence.  At block 530, if a possible matching listing equals or exceeds a predetermined level of confidence (e.g., a calculated measure of
confidence is equal to or above a first level of confidence, indicating a matching listing, or above a second level of confidence less than the first level of confidence, indicating a probable matching listing), then at block 535, the source system 32
may append a provider-supplied external identifier to (e.g., associated with) the listing.  Optionally, at block 540, the source system 32 may receive from the merchant 38 or by a human system operator 40 an override of a non-matching listing or a
probable matching listing with another listing.  At block 540, the source system 32 may receive a selection of a best matching listing from among the one or more possible matching listings received from the one or more provider systems 34a-34n either
automatically or by the merchant 38 and/or the human operator 40.  At block 545, the source system 32 may transmit the final best matching listing to one or more provider systems 34a-34n using a listings delivery method based on the presence or absence
of the provider-supplied external identifier associated with the final best matching listing.
<br/><br/> In one example, when the listing identification data provided automatically by the one or more provider systems 34a-34n or overridden by either the merchant 38 or the human system operator 40 is determined to be associated with a final best
matching listing, the source system 32 may deliver the final best matching listing (i.e., synchronizes) to the one or more provider systems 34a-34n with the provider-supplied external identifier as an indication to the one or more provider systems
34a-34n to update an enhanced listing with enhanced content.  When the listing identification data provided automatically by the one or more provider systems 34a-34n or overridden by either the merchant 38 or the human system operator 40 is determined
not to be associated with a final best matching listing, the source system 32 may deliver a listing (i.e., synchronizes the listing) without the provider-supplied external identifier as an indication to the one or more provider systems 34a-34n to create
an enhanced listings using the enhanced content proved by the merchant 38 or the human operator 40.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 6A and 6B are flow diagram illustrating an example of employing a periodic feed files delivery method 600 for delivering basic content and enhanced static content to each of the provider systems 34a-34n from a single source system (i.e.,
the source system 32).  The method 600 may be performed by the source system 32 of FIG. 3 and may comprise hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device), or a
combination thereof.  In one example, the method 600 may be performed by processing logic (not shown) of the source system 32 of FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, at block 605, at periodic intervals, e.g., each day, the listings delivery engine 114 may generate a file for each provider system 34a-34n containing associated target listings that should receive an enhanced
listing.  This file may include, but is not limited to, basic content, static enhanced content, and the provider-supplied external identifier previously identified and associated with one or more listings to be delivered, if available.  If the
provider-supplied external identifier for a given listing is not provided, then this is an indication that the listing does not exist on the provider system (e.g., 34a) and should be created by the provider system (e.g., 34a).  At block 610, for each of
the provider systems 34a-34n, the listings delivery engine 114 may transmit the generated file to the corresponding provider system (e.g., 34a).  The listings delivery engine 114 may transfer a corresponding generated file to the corresponding provider
system (e.g., 34a) via a corresponding provider periodic feed receiver 112 (using mechanisms that may include, for example, HTTP, FTP, or a custom API).  Then, for each individual provider system (e.g., the provider system 34a), blocks 615-670 are
executed as described hereinbelow.
<br/><br/> At block 615, the provider system 34a may process the listings file received at block 610 on a per listing basis.  At block 620, the provider system (e.g., 34a) may query whether the listing contains an external identifier.  If, at block 620,
the listing does not have an external identifier, then at block 625, the provider system (e.g., 34a) may create a new listing record in the provider database 44a, may assign the listing (record) a new external identifier, may add basic content and
enhanced static content from the feed (i.e. the listing data) to the new listing record, and may set a flag for the listing indicating that the listing should have dynamic enhanced content when displayed in a consumer web browser 120 as provided by the
corresponding provider directory site 116.  If, at block 620, an external identifier for the listing was supplied, then at block 635, the provider system (e.g., 34a) may query whether the listing was provided before by the source system 32.  If, at block
620, an external identifier was supplied, but the listing was not previously provided by the source system 32, then at block 640, the provider system (e.g., 34a) may store an indication that the listing with the external identifier is to receive basic
enhanced content and enhanced static content when displayed in a consumer web browser 120 as provided by a provider directory site 116 associated with the provider system 34a, may store a source system listing identifier to be associated with the
listing, and may incorporate the listing basic content and enhanced static content from the feed into an existing listing record in the provider database (e.g., 44a).  If, at block 620, an external identifier was supplied, and at block 635, a listing was
previously provided by the source system 32, then, at block 645, the provider system 34a may update the existing listing using the basic content and enhanced static content in the provider database 44a to reflect the information provided with the
received listing.  At block 650, the provider system (e.g., 34a) may query whether there are any more listings in the listing file to be processed.  If at block 650, the last listing in the listing file has not been processed, then execution returns to
block 620; otherwise, processing proceeds to block 655.
<br/><br/> At block 655, the provider system 34a may assemble a list of all of the listings that the provider system 34a indicates are to have basic content and enhanced static content (see FIGS. 7A-7C), and at block 660, the provider periodic feed
interface 112 corresponding to the provider system 34a may generate a "receipt file" containing these listings, including for each listing, the system-assigned listing identifier, a provider-supplied external identifier, and a URL where the consumer 46
can expect to see the enhanced listing on the provider system.  At block 665, the source system 32 may receive the receipt file from each of the provider systems 34a-34n wherein the provider periodic feed interface 112 returns the receipt file to the
listings delivery engine 114.  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may receive the receipt files from provider periodic feed interface 112.  At block 670, for any listings appearing for the first time as determined by a query into the system
database 42 by the power listings backend coordinator 104, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may provide the merchant 38 via the power listings web application 102 with an indication that that the enhanced listings are now in service, and may
supply the merchant 38 with a URL from which the enhanced listing associated with the business of the merchant 38 may be seen.  In an example, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may employ a web crawler to confirm that the enhanced listing is
visible on the supplied URL and that all content, including basic content, static enhanced content, and dynamic enhanced content, etc. is visible and correct, before notifying the merchant 38 that the enhanced listing is live.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 7A-7C show an example of a list of all of the listings 700 that should be enhanced listings, as provided by the source system 32 to the provider system 34a.  Reference 702 points to a first listing in XML.  Reference 704 points to an
example of a provider-supplied external identifier.  Reference 706 points to an example of a promotional message.  Reference 707 refers to an example of a list of structured listings.  Reference 708 points to the beginning of a second listing, while
reference 710 points to the end of the second listing.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 shows an example of a receipt file 800 containing the listings of FIGS. 7A and 7B.  Each block 802 includes, for example, pairs of source system provided identifiers 804 and associated provider-supplied external identifiers 806.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a flow diagram illustrating an example of employing a real-time API integration delivery method 900 for delivering basic content and enhanced static content to each of the provider systems 34a-34n from a single source system (i.e., the
source system 32).  The method 900 may be performed by the source system 32 of FIG. 4 and may comprise hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device), or a
combination thereof.  In one example, the method 900 may be performed by processing logic (not shown) of the source system 32 of FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 9, at block 905, the listing delivery engine 114 of the source system 32 may transmit the new listing to the provider listing update API 150.  At block 910, the provider system (e.g., 34a) may process the received listing by
applying different logic at block 915 based on whether the source system 32 supplies a provider-supplied external identifier.  If, at block 915, no external identifier for the listing was provided, then this may serve as an instruction to the provider
system (e.g., 34a) to add a new listing.  At block 920, the provider system (e.g., 34a) may add the new listing in near real-time, may assign it a provider-supplied external identifier, and may record an indication that it should be an enhanced listing,
including saving any basic content and enhanced static content that was transmitted along with it by the source system 32.  At block 925, the provider system (e.g., 34a) may return the newly-assigned provider-supplied external identifier to the source
system 32 along with a confirmation that the listing will become an enhanced listing.  If, at block 915, the source system 32 had transmitted a provider-supplied external identifier, the provider system (e.g., 34a) may save an indication in its database
(e.g., 44a) that the listing should be an enhanced listing (block 930) and may transmit a confirmation to the source system 32 that the request was processed (block 935).
<br/><br/> In general, a provider system (e.g., 34a) may accept and may update matching listings that are found by the source system 32.  However, given basic content of a location, a provider system (e.g., 34a) may perform their own matching method.  Per
location and provider system (e.g., 34a), the power listings backend coordinator 102 may determine and respond to a selection of an alternative listing by the provider system (e.g., 34a) by comparing the provider-supplied external identifier returned in
a response (e.g., a receipt file) from the provider system (e.g., 34a) to the provider-supplied external identifier that is returned in an API search response (or feed receipt) to the provider-supplied external identifier identified by the source system
32 during the matching process.  If there is a difference, the source system 32 may override the provider-supplied external identifier currently present in the source system database 42 with the provider-supplied external identifier provided by the
provider system (e.g., 42a).
<br/><br/> In one example, the merchant 38 (e.g., user of the source system 32) or the human operator 40 may find that there is more than one probable matching listing or matching listing currently residing on a provider system (e.g., 34a).  Accordingly,
the merchant 38 or the human operator 40 may request the source system 32 to suppress one or more duplicate listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The merchant 38 or the human operator 40 may need to confirm all probable duplicate listings on a
provider system (e.g., 34a) that were determined by the source system 32 before having the listing delivery engine 114 of the source system 32 transmit any requests to suppress the probable duplicate listings.
<br/><br/> When the merchant 38 is to confirm listings that should be suppressed, the merchant 38 may review a display associated with the power listings web application 102 of the source system 32 to observe the listing selected by the source system 32 as
a current synchronized match (e.g., the listing determined by the system as the best matching listing).  The merchant 38 may take one of two actions: (1) the merchant 38 may verify that the probable duplicate matches, which were found by the source
system 32, should be suppressed.  Accordingly, the merchant 38 may transmit one or more suppression requests using the power listings web application 102 and the listing delivery engine 114 of the source system 32; or, (2) the merchant 38 may reject
probable duplicate matches that were detected by the source system 32.  The merchant 38 may instruct the power listings web application 102 to mark the rejected duplicate(s) as non-matches and store this information in the system database 42, so that the
rejected duplicate matches would not be re-submitted for review in future duplicate scans.
<br/><br/> From the human review web application 107, the human operator 40 may confirm the following types of duplicate listings: (1) the source system 32 has identified probable duplicates, but the merchant 38 has not verified or confirmed whether the
subject listings are duplicates within a specified period of time, or (2) the merchant 38 has submitted one or more requests to suppress potential duplicate listings (of a location on a provider site), and these listings need to be reviewed by the human
operator 40.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, the human operator 40 may view the listing identification information, the synchronized listing, and the list of probable duplicates from the human review web application 107.  Accordingly, the human operator 40 may confirm one or
more probable duplicate listings need to be suppressed.  The human operator 40 may employ the listing delivery engine 114 to deliver suppression requests.  In another example, the human operator 40 may reject the one or more probable duplicate listings. 
The human operator may employ the power listings backend coordinator 104 to store one or more indications of rejected probable duplicates as non-matching listings in the system database 42 so as to avoid these listings in subsequent scans for duplicate
listings.  FIG. 10 shows a screen shot for the source system 32 removing duplicate lists associate with a location of a business.
<br/><br/> In one example, the suppression request may be submitted using an application programming interface (e.g., the provider listing update APIs 150).  Accordingly, the power listings backend coordinator 102 may transmit the provider supplied
external identifier of a listing that is to be suppressed and the provider supplied external identifier of the representative listing to the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The provider system (e.g., 34a) may respond with an indication of whether or not
the suppression attempt was successful.
<br/><br/> In another example, the suppression request may be submitted using a feed (e.g., the provider periodic feed receiver 112).  Accordingly, the power listings backend coordinator 102 may transmit the provider supplied external identifier of a
listing that is to be suppressed and the provider supplied external identifier of the representative listing to the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The provider system (e.g., 34a) may respond with an indication of whether or not the suppression attempt was
successful by producing a feed receipt file.
<br/><br/> In one example, a merchant 38 or a human operator 40 may verify whether the source system 32 had suppressed the one or more duplicate listings after receiving confirmation from the source system 32 of a successful suppression of the one or more
duplicate listings by the source system 32.  The merchant 38 or a human operator 40 may attempt to view whether the suppression attempt was successful by initiating a command to retrieve the suppressed listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a) in the
power listings web application 102 or the human review web application 107, respectively.  In one example, the merchant 38 or a human operator 40 may input a universal resource locator (URL) of the suppressed listing if the computing device supports
input of URLs.  In another example, for mobile applications without fields for inputting URLs, the duplicate listing may be removed from a search results page (SERP).
<br/><br/> The power listings web application 102 or the human review web application 107, respectively, may direct the power listings backend coordinator 104 to initiate the suppression verifier 154 to confirm whether the one or more duplicate listings
are suppressed.  How the suppression verifier 154 confirms whether the one or more duplicate listings are suppressed varies depending on the type of suppression behavior that a provider system (e.g., 34a) supports.  In one example, the suppression
verifier 154 may return the appropriate results to the power listings backend coordinator 104 and thence to the power listings web application 102 or the human review web application 107, respectively, for display to the merchant 38 or a human operator
40, respectively.  Table 1 summarizes examples of suppression behavior by the provider system (e.g., 34a), a description of the suppression behavior, and corresponding verification mechanisms.

<br/><br/> Referring to Table 1, one type of suppression behavior supported by the provider system (e.g., 34a) may be to produce an error message.  In one example, when a merchant 38 or a human operator 40 inputs a URL of the duplicate listing, the
provider system (e.g., 34a) may provide a standard 404 error message (e.g., listing not found).  The suppression verifier 154 may call the provider details APIs 152.  The human review web application calls the details API 152 of the provider system
(e.g., 34a) with the provider supplied external identifier of the suppressed listing.  The suppression verifier 154 may receive a 404 listing not found response.
<br/><br/> In another example, an additional URL may be provided.  The content of the duplicate listing may be merged to the representative (synchronized) listing.  The provider system (e.g., 34a) may direct the user (e.g., the merchant 38 or a human
review operator 40) to the representative listing when the consumer inputs the URL of the suppressed listing.  The suppression verifier 154 may call the details API 152 of the provider system (e.g., 34a) with the provider-supplied external identifier of
the suppressed listing.  The suppression verifier 154 may receive a 301 (URL redirected) response.
<br/><br/> In another example, the user (e.g., the merchant 38 or a human operator 40) may be redirected to a URL of the representative listing.  The provider system (e.g., 34a) may direct the user (e.g., the merchant 38 or a human review operator 40) to
the representative listing when the consumer inputs the URL of the suppressed listing.  The duplicate listing URL may be removed, and when reached, the provider system (e.g., 34a) provider may direct the user to the representative (synchronized) listing
directly.  The provider system (e.g., 34a) may direct the user (e.g., the merchant 38 or a human review operator 40) to the representative listing when the consumer inputs the URL of the suppressed listing.  The suppression verifier 154 may call the
details API 152 of the provider system (e.g., 34a) with the provider-supplied external identifier of the suppressed listing.  The suppression verifier 154 may receive a 301 (URL redirected) response.  In another example, the duplicate listing may be
completely removed from a search results page (SERP).
<br/><br/> With mobile apps, wherein a user cannot navigate to the duplicate URL directly, suppression verifier 154 may call the search API 108 of the provider system (e.g., 34a) with the listing identification information of the suppressed listing.  The
search API 108 of the provider system (e.g., 34a) may return an indication that the listing does not exist on the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 shows a screen shot of a search results page provided to the merchant 38 or a human review operator 40.  From the power listings web application 102 or the human review web application 107, respectively, the merchant 38 or a human review
operator 40, respectively, may view all duplicates that have been suppressed (or are being suppressed).  Information provided by the power listings web application 102 or the human review web application 107, may include, for example, listing
identification information, the provider supplied external identifier, a suppression status (which indicates the progress of the suppression attempt), provider suppression behavior, and the suppressed URL.
<br/><br/> Table 2 displays examples of suppression status that the merchant 38 or a human review operator 40, respectively.  One example of a status state is "processing." When the suppression state is "processing," the duplicate listing has been
identified, and suppression attempt has started, but has not yet been completed.  Another example of a suppression state is "suppressed." When the suppression state is "suppressed," the duplicate listing successfully suppressed, and is verified as
suppressed by the suppression verifier 154.  Another example of a suppression state is "unavailable." When the suppression state is "unavailable," the duplicate listing cannot be suppressed (or cannot be verified successfully).  The merchant 38 or a
human review operator 40, respectively, may view an unavailable reason provided by the power listings backend coordinator 104.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 Suppression Status Description Processing Duplicate has been identified, and suppression attempt has started.  Suppressed Duplicate has been successfully suppressed, and is verified by suppression verifier 154. 
Unavailable The duplicate cannot be suppressed (or can't be verified successfully).  The merchant 38 can see an unavailable reason provided by the power listings web application 102.
<br/><br/> Examples of the present disclosure are subject to numerous variations.  For example, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may find more than one potential (good or probable) matches for a listing.  Rather than automatically decide which
listing should be the representative listing (synchronized listing), the power listings backend coordinator 104 may present a whole set of listings returned by the power listings web application 102 or the human review web application 107, respectively,
to the merchant 38 or a human review operator 40, respectively.  The merchant 38 or a human review operator 40, respectively, may decide which potential match should be employed as the representative listing (synchronized listing), and which ones are
duplicates.
<br/><br/> Since duplicate listings can continuously be created, the merchant 38 or a human review operator 40, respectively, may be provided with the ability to initiate subsequent suppression attempts.  In one example, subsequent suppression attempts may
be initiated by the power listings backend coordinator 104.  After an initial setup, and for each location of a listing having a representative (synchronized) listing, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may periodically instruct the provider API
searcher 106 to search for additional duplicates on the provider systems 34a-34n through the provider details API 152 of the provider system (e.g., 34a).  Additional duplicates that are found may be confirmed by merchant 38, the human review operator 40,
or the power listings backend coordinator 104 as described hereinabove.
<br/><br/> In another example, subsequent suppression attempts may be initiated by the merchant 38 or the human review operator 40.  The merchant 38 or the human review operator 40 may direct the provider API searcher 106 to search for additional
duplicates of a listing for a location on a provider site (e.g., 34a).  If duplicates are found, the merchant 38 or the human review operator 40 may confirm the duplicates (as described above).  In another example, the merchant 38 or the human review
operator 40 may manually submit data for a duplicate listing of a location on a provider system (e.g., 34a).  The merchant 38 or the human review operator 40 may enter a URL for a duplicate listing in the power listings web application 102 or the human
review web application 107, respectively.  The power listings backend coordinator 104 may extract the provider-supplied external identifier of the listing from the URL retrieve and display the details of the listing received from the provider details API
152.  The merchant 38 or the human review operator 40 may confirm or deny whether the power listings backend coordinator 104 had provided the correct information that corresponds to the submitted URL.  If so, the power listings web application 102 or the
human review web application 107 may transmit the request to be approved by the merchant 38 or the human review operator 40, respectively (as described hereinabove).  If not, the power listings backend coordinator 104 may discard the submitted URL.  FIG.
12 shows a screen shot illustrating a successful attempt to suppress a duplicate listing manually.
<br/><br/> In another example, duplicates may be suppressed at the business level.  From time to time, merchants may have locations/stores that are closed prior to them signing up with the source system 32.  If so, the merchant 38 may provide the source
system 32 with a list of the closed store listings.  The list may be supplied to the source system 32, which in turn may submit the list to one or more of the provider systems 34a-34n to be suppressed.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 is a flow diagram illustrating an example of a method 1300 for suppressing a duplicate listing given a known representative (synchronized) listing on a provider system (e.g., 34a) from a source system 32.  The method 1300 may be
performed by the source system 32 of FIG. 4 and may comprise hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device), or a combination thereof.  In one example, the method
1300 may be performed by processing logic (not shown) of the source system 32 of FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 13, at block 1305, the source system 32 may select a representative listing of an entity (e.g., a business, an organization, a government agency, etc.) located on a provider system (e.g., 34a).  The representative listing may
comprise first identification data and a first provider-supplied external identifier.  Accordingly, at block 1310, the source system 32 may search the provider system (e.g., 34a) for additional listings having identification data matching the first
identification data.  At block 1315, the source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) a potential matching listing having identification data matching the first identification data and having a second provider-supplied external
identifier that differs from the first provider-supplied external identifier.  At block 1320, the source system 32 may designate the potential matching listing as a duplicate listing.  At block 1325, the source system 32 may transmit a request to the
provider system (e.g., 34a) to suppress the designated duplicate listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The request may comprise the second provider-supplied external identifier.
<br/><br/> In one example, the source system 32 may update in the system database 42 associated with the source system 32, a record associated with the potential matching listing with an indication that the potential matching listing is a duplication
listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  In an example, the indication may comprise the second provider-supplied external identifier.
<br/><br/> In an example, responsive to the source system 32 receiving an acknowledgement from the provider system (e.g., 34a) that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has accepted the request to suppress the designated duplicate listing in view of the second
provider-supplied external identifier, the source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) a confirmation that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the designated duplicate listing.
<br/><br/> In one example, the request by the source system 32 to suppress the designated duplicate listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a) may be transmitted to the provider system using an application programming interface (API).  Using the
application programming interface (API), the source system 32 may receive the acknowledgement and the confirmation from the provider system (e.g., 34a).  In another example, the source system 32 may transmit the request to suppress the designated
duplicate listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a) using a first feed.  The acknowledgement may be received by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a) using the first feed.  The source system 32 may receive the confirmation from the
provider system (e.g., 34a) using a second feed.
<br/><br/> In an example, in response to the source system 32 receiving from the provider system (e.g., 34a) the confirmation that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the designated duplicate listing, the source system 32 may verify that the
designated duplicate listing has been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  In one example, verifying that the designated duplicate listing has been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a) may comprise the source system 32 visiting the
address provided by a universal resource locator (URL) associated with the designated duplicate listing on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  In another example, verifying that the designated duplicate listing has been suppressed on the provider system
(e.g., 34a) may comprise the source system 32 employing an application programming interface (API) to search the provider system (e.g., 34a) for the designated duplicate listing.
<br/><br/> In an example, the source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) an indication from the provider system (e.g., 34a) that the designated duplicate listing no longer exists on the provider system 32.  In one example, the
indication may be a listing not found response.  In another example, the source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) a universal resource locator redirected response comprising a universal resource locator associated with
representative listing.  In another example, the indication may comprise the source system 32 receiving from the provider system (e.g., 34a) a list of entries.  The provider system 32 may determine that the list of entries does not contain the designated
duplicate listing.
<br/><br/> In an example, the source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) a receipt file as a confirmation that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the designated duplicate listing.  The receipt file may comprise a record
corresponding to the designated duplicate listing, the record comprising the second provider-supplied external identifier, a universal resource locator associated with the designated duplicate listing, and an indication that the designated duplicate
listing is not in service on the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> In an example, the source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) the confirmation that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the designated duplicate listing, but the source system 32 verifies that the designated
duplicate listing has not been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  Accordingly, the source system 32 may update a record in the system database 42 associated with the potential matching listing that was designated as a duplicate listing with
an indication that the potential matching listing has not been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The provider system 32 may re-transmit to the provider system (e.g., 34a) the request to suppress the designated duplicate listing on the
provider system (e.g., 34a).  The request may comprise the second provider-supplied external identifier.
<br/><br/> In another example, the source system 32 may update in the database 42 associated with the source system 32, a record associated with the potential matching listing to indicate the request to suppress the designated duplicate listing was
transmitted to the provider system (e.g., 34a), confirmed as suppressed by the provider system (e.g., 34a), but not verified by the source system 32 as suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> In one example, the source system 32 may assign a confidence score to a potential matching listing.  The confidence score may be based the one or more fields of the identification data associated with the potential matching listing.  In one
example, responsive to the source system 32 assigning the confidence score to the potential matching listing equal to or above a first threshold value, the source system may mark the potential matching listing as a confirmed matching listing.  The source
system 32 may perform the designation of the potential matching listing as the duplicate listing.  In one example, responsive to the source system 32 assigning the confidence score to the potential matching listing lower a second threshold value below
the threshold first value, the source system 32 may discard for further consideration the potential matching listing as non-matching listing.  In one example, responsive to the source system 32 assigning the confidence score to the potential matching
listing equal to or above a second threshold value below the first threshold value, the source system 32 may mark the potential matching listing as a probable matching listing.
<br/><br/> In one example, responsive to the source system designating the potential matching listing as probable matching listing, the source system 32 may present the probable matching listing to at least one of a user associated with the entity (e.g.,
the merchant 38) or a human operator 40 associated with the source system 32.  The source system 32 may receive from the at least one of the user associated with the entity (e.g., the merchant 38) or the human operator 40 associated with the source
system 32, a designation of the probable matching listing as a non-matching listing.  The source system 32 may mark in the database 42 associated with the source system 32, a record associated with the potential matching listing with an indication that
the potential matching listing is a non-matching listing.  The source system 32 may be operable to remove the non-matching listing from future consideration in searches for duplicate listings.
<br/><br/> In one example, the source system 32 may receive from at least one of the user associated with the entity (e.g., the merchant 38) or the human operator 40 associated with the source system 32, a designation of the probable matching listing as a
confirmed matching listing.  The source system 32 may mark in the database 42 associated with the source system 32, the record associated with the potential matching listing with an indication that the potential matching listing is a confirmed matching
listing.  The source system 32 may perform the designation of the potential matching listing as the duplicate listing.
<br/><br/> In one example, the source system 32 may periodically repeat the aforementioned searching, receiving a potential matching listing, designating, and transmitting to further identify and suppress duplicate listings on the provider system (e.g.,
34a) in view of the first identification data of the representative listing.  In one example, the periodic repeating may be performed automatically by the source system 32.  In another example, the periodic repeating may be initiated by at least one of
the user associated with the entity (e.g., the merchant 38) or the human operator 40 associated with the source system 32.
<br/><br/> In one example, the provider system (e.g., 34a) may be one of a plurality of provider systems 34a-34n associated with the source system 32.  Accordingly, the provider system 32 may periodically repeat the aforementioned searching, receiving a
potential matching listing, designating, and transmitting to further identify and suppress duplicate listings on the remainder of the plurality of provider systems 34a-34n in view of said extracted identification data of the representative listing.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 is a flow diagram illustrating an example of a method 1400 for suppressing a duplicate listing by first determining a representative (synchronized) listing on a provider system (e.g., 34a) from a source system 32 and then designating any
other corresponding listings for a location as duplicate listings.  The method 1400 may be performed by the source system 32 of FIG. 4 and may comprise hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g.,
instructions run on a processing device), or a combination thereof.  In one example, the method 1400 may be performed by processing logic (not shown) of the source system 32 of FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 14, at block 1405, the source system 32 may receive from a user associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant 38) initial identification data of a listing related to the entity (e.g., a business, an organization, a government
agency, etc.).  At block 1410, the source system may search a provider system (e.g., 34a) for one or more listings having identification data matching the initial identification data.  At block 1415, the source system 32 may receive from the provider
system (e.g., 34a) a plurality of potential matching listings having identification data matching the initial identification data.  Each listing of the plurality of potential matching listings may have a corresponding confidence score assigned by the
source system 32.  Each listing of the plurality of potential matching listings may have a corresponding provider-supplied external identifier assigned by the provider system (e.g., 34a).  At block 1420, the source system 32 may designate a
representative listing of the entity located on a provider system (e.g., 34a) from among the plurality of potential matching listings.  The representative listing may be the listing having the highest confidence score assigned by the source system 32. 
At block 1425, the source system 32 may designate the remaining one or more potential matching listings of the plurality of potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings.  At block 1430, the source system 32 may transmit to the provider
system (e.g., 34a) a request to synchronize the representative listing having the highest confidence score assigned by the source system 32 as the representative listing of the entity on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The request may comprise a first
provider-supplied external identifier.
<br/><br/> At block 1435, responsive to the source system 32 receiving a confirmation from the provider system (e.g., 34a) that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has synchronized the representative listing having the highest confidence score assigned by the
source system 32 as the representative listing of the entity on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the response comprising the first provider-supplied external identifier, the source system 32 may transmit to the provider system (e.g., 34a) a request to
suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings.  The request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings may comprise the remaining one or more provider-supplied external
identifiers.
<br/><br/> In one example, before transmitting the request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings, the source system 32 may verify that a plurality of fields associated with the confirmed representative listing are correct. 
Verifying that the fields of the plurality of fields associated with the confirmed representative listing are correct may comprise the source system 32 transmitting to the provider system (e.g., 34a) identification data associated with the confirmed
representative listing of the entity on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) the fields of the plurality of fields associated with the confirmed representative listing on a display (not
shown).  The source system 32 may obtain a screen shot of the display (not shown).  The source system 32 may extract the fields of the plurality of fields from the screen shot.  The source system may verify that the extracted fields are correct.
<br/><br/> In an example, verifying that the fields of the plurality of fields associated with the confirmed representative listing are correct may comprise the source system 32 transmitting to the provider system (e.g., 34a) identification data associated
with the confirmed representative listing of the entity on the provider system (e.g., 34a) using an application programming interface (API).  The identification data may comprise the first provider-supplied external identifier.  The source system 32 may
receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) the fields of the plurality of fields associated with the confirmed representative listing in a response from the application programming interface.  The source system 32 may verify that the fields in the
response from the application programming interface are correct.
<br/><br/> In an example, before the request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings, the source system 32 may update in the database 42 associated with the source system 32, a record associated with the listing having the highest
confidence score with an indication that the listing having the highest confidence score is the representative listing of the entity located on a provider system (e.g., 34a).  The indication may comprise the first provider-supplied external identifier.
<br/><br/> In an example, the request to synchronize the representative listing having the highest confidence score may be transmitted by the source system 32 to the provider system (e.g., 34a) using an application programming interface.  An
acknowledgement to accept the request to synchronize the representative listing having the highest confidence score may be received by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a) using an application programming interface.  The confirmation
that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has synchronized the representative listing may be received by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a) using the application programming interface.
<br/><br/> In an example, the request to synchronize the representative listing having the highest confidence score may be transmitted by the source system 32 to the provider system (e.g., 34a) using a first feed.  An acknowledgement to accept the request
to synchronize the representative listing having the highest confidence score may be received by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a) using the first feed.  The confirmation that the provider system 32 has synchronized the
representative listing may be received by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a) using a second feed.
<br/><br/> In one example, the source system 32 may update in the database 42 associated with the source system 32, one or more records associated with the one or more remaining potential matching listings with corresponding one or more indications that
the one or more remaining potential matching listings are one or more duplication listings on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The one or more indications may comprise the corresponding remaining one or more provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In an example, responsive to the source system 32 receiving an acknowledgement from the provider system (e.g., 34a) that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has accepted the request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings
as one or more duplicate listings, the source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) at least one confirmation that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more
duplicate listings.  The at least one confirmation may comprise the corresponding remaining one or more provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In one example, the request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings may be transmitted from the source system 32 to the provider system (e.g., 34a) using an application programming
interface.  At least one confirmation that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings may be received by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a)
using the application programming interface.
<br/><br/> In one example, the request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings may be transmitted from the source system 32 to the provider system (e.g., 34a) using a first feed.  The
acknowledgement to accept the request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings may be received by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a) using the first feed.  The confirmation
that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings may be received by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a) using a second feed.
<br/><br/> In one example, responsive to the source system 32 receiving from the provider system (e.g., 34a) the at least one confirmation that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or
more designated duplicate listings, the source system 32 may verify on the provider system (e.g., 34a) that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  In one example, the source system 32
verifying that the remaining one or more potential matching listings have been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a) may comprise, after transmitting the request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings, transmitting to
the provider system (e.g., 34a) the corresponding remaining one or more provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In one example, verifying may comprise visiting, by the source system 32 on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the corresponding one or more universal resource locators (URL) associated with the one or more designated duplicate listings.  In one
example, verifying may comprise the source system 32 employing an application programming interface (API) to search the provider system (e.g., 34a) for the one or more designated duplicate listings.
<br/><br/> In one example, verifying may comprise the source system 32 receiving one or more corresponding indications from the provider system (e.g., 34a) that the one or more designated duplicate listings no longer exist on the provider system (e.g.,
34a).  The one or more corresponding indications may be one or more listing not found responses.  In an example, verifying may comprise the source system 32 receiving from the provider system (e.g., 34a) one or more corresponding universal resource
locator redirected responses comprising one or more universal resource locators associated with representative listing.  In one example, verifying may comprise the source system 32 receiving from the provider system (e.g., 34a) a list of entries
corresponding to a search results page.  The source system may determine that the list of entries does not contain the one or more remaining listings.
<br/><br/> In one example, the source system 32 may assign a confidence score to a potential matching listing.  The confidence score may be based the one or more fields of the identification data associated with the potential matching listing.  In one
example, responsive to the source system 32 assigning the confidence score to the potential matching listing equal to or above a first threshold value, the source system may mark the potential matching listing as a confirmed matching listing.  The source
system 32 may perform the designation of the potential matching listing as the duplicate listing.  In one example, responsive to the source system 32 assigning the confidence score to the potential matching listing lower than a second threshold value
below the threshold first value, the source system 32 may discard for further consideration the potential matching listing as non-matching listing.  In one example, responsive to the source system 32 assigning the confidence score to the potential
matching listing equal to or above a second threshold value below the first threshold value, the source system may mark the potential matching listing as a probable matching listing.
<br/><br/> In one example, responsive to the source system designating the potential matching listing as probable matching listing, the source system 32 may present the probable matching listing to at least one of a user associated with the entity (e.g.,
the merchant 38) or a human operator 40 associated with the source system 32.  The source system 32 may receive from the at least one of the user associated with the entity (e.g., the merchant 38) or the human operator 40 associated with the source
system 32, a designation of the probable matching listing as a non-matching listing.  The source system 32 may mark in the database 42 associated with the source system 32, a record associated with the potential matching listing with an indication that
the potential matching listing is a non-matching listing.  The source system 32 may be operable to remove the non-matching listing from future consideration in searches for duplicate listings.
<br/><br/> In one example, the source system 32 may receive from at least one of the user associated with the entity (e.g., the merchant 38) or the human operator 40 associated with the source system 32, a designation of the probable matching listing as a
confirmed matching listing.  The source system 32 may mark in the database 42 associated with the source system 32, the record associated with the potential matching listing with an indication that the potential matching listing is a confirmed matching
listing.  The source system 32 may perform the designation of the potential matching listing as the duplicate listing.
<br/><br/> In one example, the source system 32 may periodically repeat the aforementioned searching a provider system, receiving a plurality of potential matching listings, designating a representative listing, designating the remaining one or more
potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings, transmitting a request to synchronize the representative listing, and transmitting a request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more duplicate
listings to further identify and suppress duplicate listings on the provider system (e.g., 34a) in view of the first identification data of the representative listing.  In one example, the periodic repeating may be performed automatically by the source
system 32.  In another example, the periodic repeating may be initiated by at least one of the user associated with the entity (e.g., the merchant 38) or the human operator 40 associated with the source system 32.
<br/><br/> In one example, the provider system (e.g., 34a) may be one of a plurality of provider systems 34a-34n associated with the source system 32.  Accordingly, the provider system 32 may periodically repeat the aforementioned searching a provider
system, receiving a plurality of potential matching listings, designating a representative listing, designating the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings, transmitting a request to synchronize the
representative listing, and transmitting a request to suppress the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings to further identify and suppress duplicate listings on the remainder of the plurality of provider
systems 34a-34n in view of said extracted identification data of the representative listing.
<br/><br/> FIG. 15 is a flow diagram illustrating an example of a method 1500 for suppressing a duplicate listing by first determining a representative (synchronized) listing on a provider system (e.g., 34a) and designating any other corresponding listings
for a location as duplicate listings, but the provider system (e.g., 34a) selects a different listing as the synchronized listing rather than the one selected by the source system 32.  The method 1500 may be performed by the source system 32 of FIG. 4
and may comprise hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device), or a combination thereof.  In one example, the method 1500 may be performed by processing logic
(not shown) of the source system 32 of FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 15, at block 1505, the source system 32 may receive initial identification data of a listing related to an entity.  At block 1510, the source system 32 may search a provider system (e.g., 34a) for one or more listings having
identification data matching the initial identification data.  At block 1515, the source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) a plurality of potential matching listings having identification data matching the initial identification
data.  Each listing of the plurality of potential matching listings may have a corresponding confidence score assigned by the source system 32.  Each listing of the plurality of potential matching listings may have a corresponding provider-supplied
external identifier assigned by the provider system (e.g., 34a).  At block 1520, the source system may designate a representative listing of the entity located on a provider system (e.g., 34a) from among the plurality of potential matching listings.  The
representative listing may be the listing having the highest confidence score assigned by the source system 32.  At block 1525, the source system may transmit to the provider system (e.g., 34a) a request to synchronize the representative listing having
the highest confidence score assigned by the source system 32 as the representative listing of the entity on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The request may comprise a first provider-supplied external identifier.  At block 1530, the source system may
receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) an indication that a second listing of the plurality of potential matching listings has been selected by the provider system (e.g., 34a) as the representative listing of the entity on the provider system
(e.g., 34a).  The response may comprise a second provider-supplied external identifier.  At block 1535, the source system may re-designate the second listing as the representative listing of the entity on the provider system (e.g., 34a) and may designate
the remaining one or more remaining listing of the plurality of potential matching listings as one or more duplicate listings on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  At block 1540, the source system 32 may transmit to the provider system (e.g., 34a) a
request to suppress the remaining one or more listings as one or more duplicate listings.  The request to suppress the remaining one or more listings may comprise one or more third provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In one example, the source system 32 may update in a database 42 associated with the source system 32, a record associated with the second listing with an indication that the second listing is the representative listing of the entity located on
a provider system (e.g., 34a), the indication comprising the second provider-supplied external identifier.  The source system 32 may update one or more records associated with one or more indications that the one or more remaining listings of the
plurality of potential matching listings are one or more duplicate listings on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the one or more indications comprising the one or more third provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In an example, responsive to the source system 32 receiving an acknowledgement from the provider system (e.g., 34a) that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has accepted the request to suppress the one or more remaining listings as one or more
duplicate listings, the source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) at least one confirmation that the provider system (E.g., 34a) has suppressed the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings, the at least one
confirmation comprising the corresponding remaining one or more third provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In one example, the request to suppress the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings may be transmitted from the source system 32 to the provider system (e.g., 34a) using an application programming interface.  The at
least one confirmation that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings may be received by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a) using the application programming
interface.
<br/><br/> In one example, the request to suppress the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings may be transmitted from the source system 32 to the provider system (e.g., 34a) using a first feed.  The acknowledgement to accept the
request to suppress the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings may be received by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a) using the first feed.  The at least one confirmation that the provider system (e.g.,
34a) has suppressed the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings may be received by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a) using a second feed.
<br/><br/> In an example, responsive to the source system 32 receiving from the provider system (e.g., 34a), the at least one confirmation that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or
more designated duplicate listings, the source system 32 may verify on the provider system (e.g., 34a) that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  In an example, responsive to the source
system 32 receiving from the provider system (e.g., 34a) the confirmation that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings, the source system 32 may verify on the provider system
(e.g., 34a) that the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> In one example, verifying that the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a) may comprise, after the source system 32 transmits the request to suppress the one or
more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings, transmitting to the provider system (e.g., 34a) the corresponding one or more third provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In one example, verifying that the one or more remaining listings as one or more duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a) may comprise visiting, by the source system 32 on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the
corresponding one or more universal resource locators (URL) associated with the one or more remaining listings.  In one example, the verifying may comprise employing, by the source system 32, an application programming interface (API) to search the
provider system (e.g., 34a) for the one or more remaining listings.  In one example, the verifying may comprise the source system 32 receiving one or more corresponding indications from the provider system (e.g., 34a) that the one or more remaining
listings no longer exist on the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> In one example, the one or more corresponding indications may be one or more listing not found responses.
<br/><br/> In one example, verifying may comprise receiving, by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a), one or more corresponding universal resource locator redirected responses comprising one or more universal resource locators
associated with the representative listing.  In one example, verifying may comprise receiving, by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a), a list of entries corresponding to a search results page.  The source system 32 may determine
that the list of entries does not contain the one or more remaining listings.
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 is a flow diagram illustrating an example of a method 1600 for suppressing a duplicate listing in response to a human triggering a suppression of a list of no longer valid listings on a plurality of provider systems 34a-34n.  The method
1600 may be performed by the source system 32 of FIG. 4 and may comprise hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device), or a combination thereof.  In one
example, the method 1600 may be performed by processing logic (not shown) of the source system 32 of FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 16, at block 1605, the source system 32 may receive from at least one of the user associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant 38) or the human operator 40 associated with the source system 32, an indication to suppress all
listings associated with the entity on one or more provider systems 34a-34n.  The indication may comprise identification data of the entity and an indication that the identification data of the entity is no longer valid.  At block 1610, the source system
32 may retrieve from a database 42 associated with the source system 32, a list of one or more provider systems 34a-34n associated with the source system 32 and having at least one listing corresponding to the entity.
<br/><br/> For each provider system in the list of one or more provider systems: at block 1615, the source system 32 may search the provider system (e.g., 34a) for listings having identification data matching the identification data of the entity.  At
block 1620, the source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a), one or more matching listings having identification data matching the identification data of the entity.  Each listing of the one or more matching listings may have a
corresponding provider-supplied external identifier assigned by the provider system (e.g., 34a).  At block 1625, the source system 32 may transmit to the provider system (e.g., 34a) a request to suppress the one or more matching listings on the provider
system (e.g., 34a).  The request to suppress the one or more matching listings may comprise a list of the one or more corresponding provider-supplied external identifiers.
<br/><br/> In an example, responsive to the source system 32 receiving an acknowledgement from the provider system (e.g., 34a) that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has accepted the request to suppress the one or more matching listings in view of the one or
more corresponding provider-supplied external identifiers, the source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) a confirmation that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the one or more matching listings.
<br/><br/> In one example, the request may be transmitted from the source system 32 to the provider system (e.g., 34a) using an application programming interface.  The acknowledgement and the confirmation may be received by the source system 32 from the
provider system (e.g., 34a) using the application programming interface.
<br/><br/> In an example, the request may be transmitted from the source system 32 to the provider system (e.g., 34a) using a first feed.  The acknowledgement may be received by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a) using the first
feed.  The confirmation may be received by the source system 32 from the provider system (e.g., 34a) using a second feed.
<br/><br/> In an example, responsive to the source system 32 receiving from the provider system (e.g., 34a) the confirmation that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the remaining one or more potential matching listings as one or more designated
duplicate listings, the source system 32 may verify on the provider system (e.g., 34a) that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  In an example, verifying that the one or more designated
duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a) may comprise, after the source system 32 transmits the request to the provider system (e.g., 34a) to suppress the one or more matching listings, transmitting to the provider
system (e.g., 34a) the list of the one or more corresponding provider-supplied external identifiers.  In one example, verifying that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a) may comprise the
source system 34a visiting on the provider system (e.g., 34a), the one or more universal resource locators (URL) associated with the one or more matching listings.  In one example, verifying that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been
suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a) may comprise employing, by the source system 32, an application programming interface (API) to search the provider system (e.g., 34a) for the one or more matching listings.  In an example, verifying that the
one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a) may comprise the source system 32 receiving an indication from the provider system (e.g., 34a) that the one or more matching listings no longer exist on the
provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> In an example, the indication may be one or more listing not found responses.  In one example, verifying that the one or more designated duplicate listings have been suppressed on the provider system (e.g., 34a) may comprise the source system 32
receiving from the provider system (e.g., 34a) a search results page.  The source system 32 may determine that the search results page does not contain the one or more matching listings.
<br/><br/> In an example, the source system 32 receiving a confirmation that the provider system (e.g., 34a) has suppressed the one or more matching listings may comprise receiving a receipt file.  The receipt file may comprise one or more records
corresponding to the one or more matching listings.  Each record of the one or more records may comprise a provider-supplied external identifier associated a corresponding matching listing, a universal resource locator associated with the corresponding
matching listing, and an indication that the corresponding matching listing is not in service on the provider system (e.g., 34a).
<br/><br/> In one example, the source system 32 may receive from at least one of the user associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant 38) or the human operator 40 associated with the source system 32, identification data of a replacement entity for
delivery of an enhanced listing to a plurality of provider systems 34a-34n.  For each provider system (e.g., 34a) of the plurality of provider systems 34a-34n: the source system 32 may transmit to the provider system (e.g., 34a) identification data of
the replacement entity and the enhanced listing to the provider system (e.g., 34a) without a provider-supplied external identifier as an indication to the provider system (e.g., 34a) to create a listing using the enhanced content.
<br/><br/> FIG. 17 is a flow diagram illustrating an example of a method 1700 for suppressing a duplicate listing on a plurality of provider systems 34a-34n.  The method 1700 may be performed by the source system 32 of FIG. 4 and may comprise hardware
(e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device), or a combination thereof.  In one example, the method 1700 may be performed by processing logic (not shown) of the source
system 32 of FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 17, at block 1705, the source system 32 may receive from a user associated with an entity (e.g., a merchant 38), an indication that a listing related to an entity is a duplicate listing of the entity on a provider system (e.g.,
34a).  At block 1710, the source system 32 may search the provider system (e.g., 34a) for the listing, the listing having identification data.  At block 1715, the source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a) the listing having the
identification data.  The listing may not be marked by the source system 32 as a representative listing of the entity located on a provider system (e.g., 34a), nor be marked by the source system 32 as a duplicate listing of the representative listing for
other entities.  At block 1720, the source system may designate the listing as a probable matching listing of the entity on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  At block 1725, the source system may transmit to a human operator 40 associated with the source
system 32, the probable matching listing for review.
<br/><br/> In one example, the human operator 40 may employ the source system 32 to search the provider system (e.g., 34a) for the probable matching listing.  The human operator 40 associated with the source system 32 may receive an indication that the
probable matching listing does not exist on the provider system.  The source system 32 may receive from the human operator 38 associated with the source system 32, an indication of a rejection of the probable matching listing as the listing of the entity
on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The source system 32 may transmit to the user associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant 38) the indication of the rejection.
<br/><br/> In one example, the human operator 40 associated with the source system 32 may search the database 42 associated with the provider system 32 for the probable matching listing.  The human operator 40 associated with the source system 32 may
receive from the source system 32, an indication that the probable matching listing exits on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The probable matching listing may be marked on the provider system (e.g., 34a) as a representative listing or a duplicate
listing associated with another entity on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The source system 32 may receive from the human operator 40 associated with the source system 32, an indication of a rejection of the probable matching listing as the listing of
the entity on a provider system (e.g., 34a).  The source system 32 may transmit to the user associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant 38), the indication of the rejection.
<br/><br/> In one example, the human operator 40 associated with the source system 32 may search the provider system (e.g., 34a) for the probable matching listing.  The human operator 38 associated with the source system 32 may receive from the source
system 32, an indication that the probable matching listing exits on the provider system (e.g. 34a).  The probable matching listing may be neither marked on the provider system (e.g., 34a) as a representative listing nor be marked as duplicate listing
associated with another entity on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The source system 32 may receive from the human operator 40 associated with the source system 32, an indication of a rejection of the probable matching listing as the listing of the
entity on a provider system (e.g., 34a).  The source system 32 may transmit to the user associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant 38), the indication of the rejection.
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 is a flow diagram illustrating an example of a method 1800 for suppressing a duplicate listing on a plurality of provider systems 34a-34n.  The method 1800 may be performed by the source system 32 of FIG. 4 and may comprise hardware
(e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device), or a combination thereof.  In one example, the method 1800 may be performed by processing logic (not shown) of the source
system 32 of FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 18, at block 1805, the source system 32 may receive from a user associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant 38), a listing no longer associated with an entity on a provider system (e.g., 34a).  At block 1810, the source system
32 may search the provider system (e.g., 34a) for the listing, the listing having identification data.  At block 1815, the source system 32 may receive from the provider system (e.g., 34a), the listing having the identification data.  The listing may not
be marked by the source system 32 as a representative listing of the entity located on a provider system (e.g., 34a) nor be marked by the source system 32 as a duplicate listing of the representative listing for other entities.  At block 1820, the source
system may designate the listing as a probable matching listing of the entity on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  At block 1825, the source system 32 may transmit to a human operator 40 associated with the source system 32, the probable matching listing
for review.
<br/><br/> In one example, the human operator 40 associated with the source system 32 may employ the source system 32 to search the provider system (e.g., 34a) for the probable matching listing.  The human operator 40 associated with the source system 32
may receive an indication that the probable matching listing does not exist on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The source system 32 may receive from the human operator 40 associated with the source system 32, an indication of a rejection of the
probable matching listing as the listing of the entity on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The source system 32 may transmit to the user associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant 38), the indication of the rejection.
<br/><br/> In one example, the human operator 40 associated with the source system may employ the source system 32 to search the provider system (e.g., 34a) for the probable matching listing.  The human operator 38 associated with the source system 32 may
receive an indication that the probable matching listing exits on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The probable matching listing may be marked on the provider system (e.g., 34a) as a representative listing or a duplicate listing associated with another
entity on the provider system (e.g., 34a).  The source system 32 may receive from the human operator 40 associated with the source system 32, an indication of a rejection of the probable matching listing as the listing of the entity on a provider system
(e.g., 34a).  The source system 32 may transmit to the user associated with an entity (e.g., the merchant 38), the indication of the rejection.

<br/><br/> FIG. 19 illustrates a diagrammatic representation of a machine in the exemplary form of a computer system 1900 within which a set of instructions, for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein, may be
executed.  In alternative embodiments, the machine may be connected (e.g., networked) to other machines in a local area network (LAN), an intranet, an extranet, or the Internet.  The machine may operate in the capacity of a server or a client machine in
a client-server network environment, or as a peer machine in a peer-to-peer (or distributed) network environment.  The machine may be a personal computer (PC), a tablet PC, a set-top box (STB), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a
web appliance, a server, a network router, switch or bridge, or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions (sequential or otherwise) that specify actions to be taken by that machine.  Further, while only a single machine is illustrated, the
term "machine" shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set (or multiple sets) of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.
<br/><br/> The exemplary computer system 1900 includes a processing device 1902, a main memory 1904 (e.g., read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) (such as synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) or Rambus DRAM (RDRAM), etc.), a static
memory 1906 (e.g., flash memory, static random access memory (SRAM), etc.), and a data storage device 1918, which communicate with each other via a bus 1930.
<br/><br/> Processing device 1902 represents one or more general-purpose processing devices such as a microprocessor, central processing unit, or the like.  More particularly, the processing device may be complex instruction set computing (CISC)
microprocessor, reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microprocessor, very long instruction word (VLIW) microprocessor, or processor implementing other instruction sets, or processors implementing a combination of instruction sets.  Processing device
1902 may also be one or more special-purpose processing devices such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), a digital signal processor (DSP), network processor, or the like.  Processing device 1902
is configured to execute listings manager logic 1922 for performing the operations and steps discussed herein.
<br/><br/> Computer system 1900 may further include a network interface device 1908.  Computer system 1900 also may include a video display unit 1910 (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a cathode ray tube (CRT)), an alphanumeric input device 1912
(e.g., a keyboard), a cursor control device 1914 (e.g., a mouse), and a signal generation device 1916 (e.g., a speaker).
<br/><br/> Data storage device 1918 may include a machine-readable storage medium (or more specifically a computer-readable storage medium) 1920 having one or more sets of instructions (e.g., listing manager logic 1922) embodying any one or more of the
methodologies of functions described herein.  Listings manager logic 1922 may also reside, completely or at least partially, within main memory 1904 and/or within processing device 1902 during execution thereof by computer system 1900; main memory 1904
and processing device 1902 also constituting machine-readable storage media.  Listings manager logic 1922 may further be transmitted or received over a network 1926 via network interface device 1908.
<br/><br/> Machine-readable storage medium 1920 may also be used to store the device queue manager logic persistently.  While machine-readable storage medium 1920 is shown in an exemplary embodiment to be a single medium, the term "machine-readable storage
medium" should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and/or associated caches and servers) that store the one or more sets of instructions.  The term "machine-readable storage medium" shall
also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing or encoding a set of instruction for execution by the machine and that causes the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention.  The term "machine-readable
storage medium" shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, and optical and magnetic media.
<br/><br/> The components and other features described herein can be implemented as discrete hardware components or integrated in the functionality of hardware components such as ASICs, FPGAs, DSPs or similar devices.  In addition, these components can be
implemented as firmware or functional circuitry within hardware devices.  Further, these components can be implemented in any combination of hardware devices and software components.
<br/><br/> Some portions of the detailed descriptions are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory.  These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those
skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art.  An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result.  The steps are
those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities.  Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated.  It has
proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.
<br/><br/> It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities.  Unless specifically stated otherwise, as
apparent from the above discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as "enabling", "transmitting", "requesting", "identifying", "querying", "retrieving", "forwarding", "determining", "passing",
"processing", "disabling", or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's
registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the present invention also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein.  This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or
reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer.  Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs and magnetic-optical
disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, flash memory devices including universal serial bus (USB) storage devices (e.g., USB key devices) or any type of media suitable for storing
electronic instructions, each of which may be coupled to a computer system bus.
<br/><br/> The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus.  Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein or it may prove convenient
to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps.  The required structure for a variety of these systems will be apparent from the description above.  In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any
particular programming language.  It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.
<br/><br/> It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive.  Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading and understanding the above description.  Although the
present invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments, it will be recognized that the invention is not limited to the embodiments described, but can be practiced with modification and alteration within the spirit and scope
of the appended claims.  Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative sense rather than a restrictive sense.  The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along
with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.
