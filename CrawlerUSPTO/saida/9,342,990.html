</font><br/>
       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A learning management system and method displays a learning environment
     for delivery of instructional material to a remote student workstation
     student after authenticating a student at the remote student workstation.
     The learning environment displays a user interface to the student on the
     remote student workstation used to interact with an instructional
     material when the student enters into a learning session associated with
     a course when messages are communicated to and from the student.
     Communicated messages with the student are monitored to determine whether
     a message contains an unauthorized content and upon detection of an
     unauthorized content, an alert message is transmitted, for example, to an
     student associated with the course or to the student.

       <br/><br/>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
<br/><br/> This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application
     Ser. No. 61/677,990, entitled "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR INTERFACING WITH
     STUDENTS OVER A NETWORK", filed Jul. 31, 2012, the contents of which are
     hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>The invention claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A learning management system comprising: a learning system including at least one processor, the learning system being configured to display a learning environment
for delivery of instructional material to a remote student workstation after authenticating a student at the remote student workstation, wherein the learning environment displays a user interface to the student on the remote student workstation;  wherein
the user interface is used to interact with an instructional material when the student enters into a learning session associated with a course;  and a networking service in communication with the learning system configured to communicate messages to and
from the student during the learning session with a network of mandatory contacts from the course and with a network of student-selected contacts outside the course, wherein the communication of messages with the student from both the network of
mandatory contacts and the network of student-selected contacts are monitored to determine whether a message contains an unauthorized content, wherein when it is determined that a message contains unauthorized content based on the monitoring, an alert is
generated, wherein the networking service automatically sanitizes the message when it is determined that the message contains unauthorized content, wherein the automatically sanitizing is removing only the unauthorized content from the message or
otherwise redacting the message prior to being received by the recipient, and wherein said learning system includes a module that is configured to receive a policy stored in a student or social network database, the policy specifying topics or words that
are inappropriate content in the messages.
<br/><br/> 2.  The learning management system of claim 1, wherein the networking service transmits an alert message when the alert is generated, the alert message being transmitted to at least one of an instructor associated with the course, an
administrator, or the student.
<br/><br/> 3.  The learning management system of claim 1, further comprising a chat module that facilitates text chatting from the remote student workstation of the student to others, wherein the messages communicated to and from the student are monitored
for unauthorized content.
<br/><br/> 4.  The learning management system of claim 1, further comprising a connection layer module that is configured to receive communication messages in one language and send the communication messages in another language, wherein the connection
layer module translates a communication message from a first user to a second user based on receiving a first user's communication in a first language and receiving a second user's communication in a second different language, and wherein the networking
service determines whether the translated communication message contains unauthorized content.
<br/><br/> 5.  The learning management system of claim 2, wherein the alert message contains the unauthorized content.
<br/><br/> 6.  The learning management system of claim 1, wherein the unauthorized content is deleted from the message prior to being received by the student.
<br/><br/> 7.  The learning management system of claim 1, wherein the unauthorized content is redacted from the message prior to being received by the student.
<br/><br/> 8.  A computer-implemented method of managing a learning management system comprising: displaying on a learning system comprising at least one processor a learning environment for delivery of instructional material to a remote student

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>FIELD
<br/><br/> The present invention is generally directed to learning systems and methods, and in particular, the present invention relates to preventing communication of unauthorized content during a learning session.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> With developments in the education industry, students seek access to course-related information and their own course work, anywhere, anytime.  Students want current, relevant, interesting and engaging course materials and assignments taught by
teachers, instructors, counselors and advisors who are aware of student's educational and professional path and goals based on a clear map of course progress and degree program.  Enabling and facilitating students' online activities around their campus
is a major consideration in providing the desired student experience.
<br/><br/> Online education now demands providing educational services to a diverse global audience from different cultural backgrounds.  Education providers face the challenge of providing high quality education across a diverse student population. 
Educational programs must provide skills that students can apply in their lives and professions to make a real difference in the real world.  Educators must strive to create a community of learners connected to one another.  A learning management system
(LMS), as referred to in the art, is software for delivering, tracking and managing training of students.  LMSs range from systems for managing student training records to software for distributing courses over the Internet and offering features for
online collaboration.  In many instances, LMSs are used to automate record-keeping as well as to register students for classroom and online courses.  Self-registration, faculty-led learning, learning workflow, the provision of on-line learning (e.g.,
read and understand), on-line assessment, management of continuous professional education (CPE), collaborative learning (e.g., application sharing, discussion threads), and learning resource management (e.g., instructors, facilities,
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 depicts a known LMS 10, including one offered by Blackboard, WebCT, Moodle, eCollege and others, which allows a faculty member to place his or her courses, in whole or in part, online.  As depicted, the faculty 12 plays a central role for
mediating between a student 13, presenting course content 15 and assessing a student 14.  LMSs 10 usually provide all-inclusive learning environments for faculty and students, with the faculty 12 disseminating instructional material specific to a course
of study amongst students.  As such, the faculty member serves as the facilitator, assessor and content developer.
<br/><br/> Conceptually, there is no difference between the role of a teacher in conventional LMSs 10 and the role of a teacher in a bricks and mortar classroom.  In both cases, the students are grouped and assigned a specific teacher.  The teacher
introduces all course content and materials into the classroom and mediates and assesses the learning process of the student.  Thus, under LMS 10, the web is a tool to replicate, as closely as possible, the traditional classroom environment and the LMS
10 is limited by its system boundaries, just as the physical classroom is limited by four walls and doors.
<br/><br/> With advances in content and media delivery technologies, the LMS model has not fully taken advantage of the available features for educating students.  For example, such advances allow students to access educational content not only via laptops
and desktops, but also smart phones, PDA's, iPods, Netbooks and eBooks.  It is, for example, estimated that the majority of prospective student market has a smart phone or PDA, with advances content delivery capabilities via downloadable applications or
by content streaming.  These new devices have enabled users access to podcasting, wikis, blogs, web cams, eBook readers, MP3 players, social networks and virtual learning environments.
<br/><br/> Conventional LMS developers' attempt in incorporating new features into their existing systems in some cases can result in significant developments cost in redesigning their content to incorporate the functionality of these new technologies.  In
other cases, the developers may have to open up their system platform through application programming interfaces (API's) to "bolt on" new technological capabilities.  LMS redesign investment may be expensive, especially when new development work may not
be able to keep up with the proliferation of ever advancing technologies and features.  Opening up platforms through APIs may present a significant competitive disadvantage to LMS vendors and service providers who have invested heavily in their
proprietary instructional material delivery systems.
<br/><br/> Additionally, educational services are increasingly offered over global networks of institutions and universities.  For example, Laureate Education Inc., the assignee of the present application, currently offers accredited campus-based and
online courses in a wide variety of programs, including undergraduate and graduate degree programs and specializations, to nearly a wide range of students in numerous countries.  Such a global educational network requires supporting learning environments
that are tailored to bring to students a global perspective blended with a local point of view, creating a truly multicultural, career-oriented educational experience for students.  For example, the educational experience may be a career-focused or
licensing program, a multi-year undergraduate degree program, or master's and/or doctorate degree program in any one of a number of fields including engineering, education, business, health care, hospitality, architecture, and information technology,
etc.
<br/><br/> The advent of social networking platforms is impacting the way(s) in which learners engage with technology in general.  Curriculum uses of social networking services also can include sharing curriculum-related resources.  Educators tap into
user-generated content to find and discuss curriculum-related content for students.  Responding to the popularity of social networking services among many students, teachers are increasingly using social networks to supplement teaching and learning in
traditional classroom environments as they can provide new opportunities for enriching existing curriculum through creative, authentic and/or flexible, non-linear learning experiences.  Some social networks, such as English, baby! and LiveMocha, are
explicitly education-focused and couple instructional content with an educational peer environment.  The Web 2.0 technologies built into most social networking services promote conferencing, interaction, creation, research on a global scale, enabling
educators to share, remix, and repurpose curriculum resources.  In short, social networking services can become research networks as well as learning network.
<br/><br/> The use of online social networks by school libraries is also increasingly prevalent, and they are being used to communicate with potential library users, as well as extending the services provided by individual school libraries.  Educators and
advocates of new digital literacies are confident that social networking encourages the development of transferable, technical, and social skills of value in formal and informal learning.  In a formal learning environment, goals or objectives are
determined by an outside department or agency.  Tweeting, instant messaging, or blogging enhances student involvement.  Students who would not normally participate in class are more apt to partake through social network services.  Networking allows
participants the opportunity for just-in-time learning and higher levels of engagement.  The use of social networking allows educators to enhance the prescribed curriculum.  When learning experiences are infused into a website that students utilize every
day for fun, students realize that learning can and should be a part of everyday life.
<br/><br/> Social networking services foster learning through what is described as a "Participatory Culture." A participatory culture consists of a space that allows engagement, sharing, mentoring, and an opportunity for social interaction.  Participants
of social network services may avail themselves of this opportunity.  Informal learning, in the forms of participatory and social learning online, is an excellent tool for teachers to sneak in material and ideas that students will identify with, and
therefore, in a secondary manner, students will learn skills that would normally be taught in a formal setting in the more interesting and engaging environment of social learning.  Sites like Twitter provide students with the opportunity to converse and
collaborate with others in real time.  Social networking services provide a virtual "space" for learners.
<br/><br/> Social networks focused on supporting relationships between teachers and their students are now used for learning, educator professional development, and content sharing.  Ning for teachers, TermWiki, Learn Central, TeachStreet and other sites
are being built to foster relationships that include educational blogs, eportfolios, formal and ad hoc communities, as well as communication such as chats, discussion threads, and synchronous forums.  These sites also have content sharing and rating
features.
<br/><br/> Laureate Education Inc.'s U.S.  Patent Publication No. 2009-0311658 A1, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, discloses "System And Method For Collaborative Development Of Online Courses And Programs Of Study" over a
social network.  A database stores an initial framework that defines a sequence of learning units for creating a desired learning environment for students.  The learning units are identified by corresponding learning unit identifiers.  A plurality of
workstations coupled to the network are used for entry of reviewer information by the participants using the learning environment created for the students.  The reviewer information comprise one or more comments entered by one participant about a
learning unit and a rank entered by another participant about the comment, with the rank being correlated with a defined ranking standard.  A processor processes the rank according to a predefined criteria to produce a ranking result that is associated
with a learning unit identifier.  The ranking result is used for associating learning content to the learning unit identified by the learning unit identifier.
<br/><br/> Laureate Education Inc.'s U.S.  Patent Publication No. US 2009-0291426 A1, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, discloses an "Educational System For Presenting One Or More Learning Units To Students In Different
Learning Environments", where each unit is associated with an assessment information relating to students.  A digital rights and asset management application controls access to the content associated with each one of said one or more units according to
corresponding unit identifiers.  An assessment application, e.g., a grade book application, stores assessment information derived from presenting the content to said one or more users in the first and second interactive environments, including social
networks, with the unit identifier correlating the assessment information with the units.
<br/><br/> Social networking sites share a variety of technical features that allow individuals to: construct a public/semi-public profile, articulate a list of other users that they share a connection with, and view their list of connections within the
system.  The most basic of these are visible profiles with a list of "friends" who are also users of the site.  A profile is generated from answers to questions, such as age, location, interests, etc. Some sites allow users to upload pictures, add
multimedia content, or modify the look and feel of the profile.  Others, e.g., <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> allow users to enhance their profile by adding modules or "Applications." Many sites allow users to post blog entries, search for others with similar interests and
compile and share lists of contacts.  User profiles often have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users.  To protect user privacy, social networks typically have controls that allow users to choose who can view their profile, contact
them, add them to their list of contacts, and so on.  Some social networks have additional features, such as the ability to create groups that share common interests or affiliations, upload or stream live videos, and hold discussions in forums.
<br/><br/> Companies have begun to merge business technologies and solutions, such as cloud computing, with social networking concepts.  Instead of connecting individuals based on social interest, companies are developing interactive communities that
connect individuals based on shared business needs or experiences.  Many provide specialized networking tools and applications that can be accessed via their websites, such as LinkedIn.  Others companies, such as Monster.com, have been steadily
developing a more "socialized" feel to their career center sites to harness some of the power of social networking sites.  These more business related sites have their own nomenclature for the most part but the most common naming conventions are
"Vocational Networking Sites" or "Vocational Media Networks", with the former more closely tied to individual networking relationships based on social networking principles.
<br/><br/> An activity stream is a list of recent activities performed by an individual, typically on a single website.  For example, <b><i>Facebook's</i></b> News Feed is an activity stream.  When users are logged into <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> a News Feed presents constantly updated
list of their friends' <b><i>Facebook</i></b> activity.  The News Feed highlights information that includes profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays, among other updates.  The News Feed also shows conversations taking place between the walls of a user's
friends.  An integral part of the News Feed interface is the Mini-Feed, a news stream on the user's profile page that shows updates about that user.  Unlike in the News Feed, the user can delete events from the Mini-Feed after they appear so that they
are no longer visible to profile visitors.  News Feed shows top stories and most recent stories in one feed, and the option to highlight stories to make them top stories, as well as to un-highlight stories.  The News Feed allow users to view recent
stories first.
<br/><br/> Since the proliferation of activity streams on websites, there have been calls to standardize the format so that websites could interact with a stream provided by another website.  The Activity Streams project, for example, is an effort to
develop an activity stream protocol to syndicate activities across social Web applications.  Activity Streams is an open format specification for activity stream protocols, which are used to syndicate activities taken in social web applications and
services, similar to those in <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Newsfeed, FriendFeed, the Movable Type Action Streams plugin, etc. Several major websites with activity stream implementations have already opened up their activity streams to developers to use, including <b><i>Facebook</i></b>
and MySpace.  <b><i>Facebook</i></b> Desktop for Adobe AIR lets users see a running timeline, or stream, of the activities of their friends on a desktop computer or even on a cell phone.  Though activity stream arises from social networking, nowadays it has become an
essential part of business software.  Enterprise social software is used in different types of companies to organize their internal communication and acts as an important addition to traditional corporate intranet.  Such major collaboration software like
Jive Software, Yammer, or Chatter offer activity stream as a separate product.  At the same time other major software providers, such as tibbr, Central Desktop, and Wrike offer activity stream as an integrated part of their collaboration software
solution.
<br/><br/> With advances in information technologies, there exists a need for an educational system that prevents illicit flow of information during learning process.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Briefly, according to the present invention, a learning management system and method displays a learning environment for delivery of instructional material to a remote student workstation student after authenticating a student at the remote
student workstation.  The learning environment displays a user interface to the student on the remote student workstation used to interact with an instructional material when the student enters into a learning session associated with a course when
messages are communicated to and from the student.  Communicated messages with the student are monitored to determine whether a message contains an unauthorized content and upon detection of an unauthorized content, an alert message is transmitted, for
example, to an student associated with the course or to the student.

<br/><br/> Updates Stream
<br/><br/> Interface 700 may include stream button 720, filter bar 725, and stream section 730.  When a user activates the stream button 720, filter bar 725, stream section 730, or any combination thereof may be displayed.  Stream section 730 may display a
stream of updates associated with courses, communities, circles, or any combination thereof.  Updates may include updates on other users' chat statuses or new information associated with other people.  Stream section 730 may display, for each update, the
source of the update, who posted the updated, the time of the update, a message, a content item, or any combination thereof.  Update stream module 440 may provide educational system 200 with updates and information relating to the user's stream.
<br/><br/> Filter bar 725 may provide a drop-down menu that may allow a user to filter the user's stream by various options, including filtering by community, a course, circle, contact, user, status, location, any other filtering option described herein,
or any combination thereof.  When a filtering option is chosen from the filter bar 725, the stream section 730 may be updated to display those stream items that met the filtering options.  Education system 200 may detect that the user has selected a
particular filter, and then only push to the user updates that satisfy the filter.  The update viewing section may be a truncated area in a panel which can be left open while the user browses the system, or may be a full page area that may be navigated
away from.  Update stream module 440 may provide educational system 200 with updates and information relating to the user's stream.
<br/><br/> Education system 200 may filter updates based upon other criteria.  The system may filter updates based on those users currently on-screen.  Filtering may be based upon the focus of the portal.  For example, if a History course is selected, the
user may see a certain group of student status updates for the users in History course.  When the user switches to an English course, the History course updates may be removed.  The filtering described herein allows educational system 200 to avoid
sending updates or buddy lists that are not being used because the updates or users have been filtered out.  As a result, the server may avoid sending extraneous data regarding updates, e.g., updates about people, when the user will not even see the
updates.  Update stream module 440 may provide educational system 200 with updates and information relating to the user's stream.
<br/><br/> Student-Selected Contacts and Mandatory Contacts
<br/><br/> A networked computer system provides various services for assisting users in locating, and establishing contact relationships with, other users.  For example, in one embodiment, users can identify other users based on their affiliations with
particular schools or other organizations.  The system also provides a mechanism for a user to selectively establish contact relationships or connections with other users, and to grant permissions for such other users to view personal information of the
user.  The system may also include features for enabling users to identify contacts of their respective contacts.  In addition, the system may automatically notify users of personal information updates made by their respective contacts.
<br/><br/> A network service comprises a platform that builds a plurality of networks of related users.  Such network service platform may be presented to the users via a website served by servers, such as those disclosed in connection with FIGS. 2-4. 
Network services allow for creation of user profile pages that may include pictures and user information.
<br/><br/> The users may be related based on shared interests in learning a subject.  For example, the related users can be students taking the same course or classes.  The related users can comprise students and faculty responsible for mediating
instructional material for a course of study.  The related users can be students having shared interest in learning about a specific subject that is offered by a learning institution, or various learning activities.  The related users can comprise
students and other users that have real-life connections with the students.  Such real-life connections can be based on friendship, ethnical backgrounds, etc.
<br/><br/> A learning management system may comprise a database, a learning system, and a networking service.  The database, such as any one or more of those depicted in FIGS. 2 and 3 or otherwise described herein, may store electronic addresses for a
plurality of contacts associated with the student.  The student's contacts may be any other system user that is associated with the user.  As discussed above, a user's contact may be in a community with the user, a circle with the user, a course with the
user, or any combination thereof.  A student may be associated with a set of student's contacts, i.e. contacts of the student.  The set of student's contacts may comprise at least one student-selected contact and at least one mandatory contact.  The
student-selected contact may be a contact designated by the student to be in the set of the student's contacts.  For example, the student-selected contact may a member of a circle of the student, another user added by the student to the student's contact
list, or any other contact otherwise identified by the student as the student's contact.  In some embodiments, the student-selected contact may a member of a contact group that is subject to a group approval, such as a community.
<br/><br/> The mandatory contact may be a contact that is not designated by the student to be in the set of the student's contacts, but is still one of the student's contacts.  For example, a mandatory contact may be a classmate that is enrolled in the
same course with the student, a course instructor assigned to the course, an assessor of student performance of the course, a course developer assigned to a course, a member of a contact group that is subject to group approval (e.g. a member of a
community), or any other contact not selected, designated, and/or identified by the student to be in the set of student's contacts.  Courses, as a type of association of contacts, may refer to groups of connected users (e.g. students, teachers, teaching
assistants) that are involved in the same course.  Membership in a course may be mandatory in that any person involved with a course may automatically be included in the course group, and the user may not have the ability to opt-out of the course group. 
Similarly, a mandatory contact, or compulsory contact, of the student may be automatically included in the student's contacts, and the student may not be able to remove the mandatory contact from the student's contacts.  The identification, selection, or
assignment of mandatory contacts of a student, e.g. members of a course group, may be provided by a registrar, another source of course enrollment data, or any other source on the system.
<br/><br/> The learning system may be configured to deliver one or more instructional materials to the student.  The one or more instructional materials may be any of those discussed herein.
<br/><br/> The networking service may be in communication with the learning management system, and the networking service may be configured to provide a user interface that enables the student to communicate messages with the student-selected contact and
the mandatory contact.  The user interface may be any of those depicted herein, e.g. interfaces provided for chatting, posting updates, etc.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the user interface may enable the student to selectively communicate messages with the student-selected contact and mandatory contact during a learning session.  For example, a user may send or receive messages, updates,
chats, feed information, status updates, presence updates, or any other communication from the student-selected contact and/or the mandatory contact during a learning session.  For example, the communications could be the updates depicted in FIG. 7.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the one or more instructional materials are associated with a course of study, and the mandatory contact is associated with a course contact.  For example, the mandatory contact may be associated with another student taking
the course, a course instructor assigned to the course, an assessor of student performance in the course, a course developer assigned to the course, or any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> Streams
<br/><br/> A network computer system, such as the ones described herein, may include social networking features that allow students, faculty, or other users to communicate with one other while using other features provided by the system.  When using the
social networking services, a user may receive updates about social networking contacts.  Updates may include updates on other users' chat statuses or new information associated with other people.  The updates may be displayed as a stream.  In some
embodiments, the updates may appear as a live stream, i.e., in which new updates are displayed as they occur on a real-time basis, or, where users' activities are streamed as soon as they happen.  A stream may display, for each update, the source of the
update, who posted the updated, the time of the update, a message, a content item, or any combination thereof.  The stream may be displayed while users are interacting with other parts of the system.
<br/><br/> Because a stream may include an overwhelming amount of information, the items of a stream may be filtered.  As discussed herein, a user may have the option of filtering updates in the stream to include only those updates meeting specified
criteria, such as membership in one or more courses, circles, communities.
<br/><br/> Additionally or alternatively, smart filtering may also be used, in which filtering is performed automatically by the system based on a user's interactions.
<br/><br/> In the learning management system, a server configured to create a learning environment on a remote student workstation or accessible by a remote workstation for delivery of instructional material to a student after the server authenticates a
student log-in. The created learning environment displays a user interface to the student on the remote student workstation, such as the interfaces described herein.  The user interface may also be used to interact with an instructional material when the
student enters into a learning session associated with a course.  The learning session may refer to when a student interacts with an instructional material.  If the student does not interact with instructional material, then there is no learning session. FIG. 14, which will be described in more detail below, depicts an example of a learning session in which instructional materials are presented to a student and the student interacts with the instructional material.
<br/><br/> A database, such as any of those discussed herein, may store electronic addresses for a plurality of contacts associated with the student.  The plurality of contacts may comprise any of the contact types disclosed herein.  The student may be
associated with a set of student's contacts comprising a first contact associated with the first course and a second contact.
<br/><br/> A networking service in communication with the server may be configured to display to the student, within the learning environment, a first activity stream associated with the first contact and a second activity stream associated with the second
contact, wherein upon detection of student's entry into the learning session, the first activity stream is displayed without displaying the second activity stream.  For example, a user may be enrolled in and receive activity stream updates from contacts
in four classes.  The system may detect that a user is currently working on a lessons for a first class, and based on that information, remove from the activity stream updates from the other three classes.  When the user later switches to working on
lessons for a second class, updates from the first class may be removed from being displayed, and the activity stream updates from the second class may be displayed to the user.  Although in this example the second activity stream is associated with a
second class, the second activity stream may be any activity stream.  For example, the activity stream may correspond to updates from a community, a circle, or any other organizational structure recognized by the system.
<br/><br/> Many possible configurations for displaying the activity streams are possible.  For example, upon detection of the student's exit from the learning session (e.g. the student leaves the instructional material to visit a different class or group),
the second activity stream may be displayed.  The second activity stream may be displayed concurrently with the displaying of the first activity stream, e.g. after the user exited the learning session, the user's contacts associated with learning session
may be displayed with all of the other contacts of the student.  Alternatively, the second activity stream may displayed without displaying the first activity stream.  The first activity stream may comprises a first message from the first contact, the
second activity stream may comprises a second message from the second contact, or any combination thereof.  At least one of the first activity stream or second activity stream may comprises a message transmitted from the student.  The first activity
stream may comprise a first status update from the first contact, the second activity stream may comprise a second status update from the second contact, or any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> The instructional material may be concurrently displayed with the first activity stream.  For example, the user may view the activity stream of updates from classmates displayed on an interface while interacting with instructional materials,
e.g. a lecture, presentation, etc., that are also displayed on the interface.
<br/><br/> The first contact may be associated with another course student, a course instructor, a course performance assessor, a course developer, or a course administrator.  The second contact may be associated with a student-selected contact.  At least
one of the first or second activity streams may comprise a live stream, in which updates are received in a real-time basis as they occur.  A message corresponding to the second activity stream is transmitted to the student upon detection of student's
exit from the learning session.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a server, such as any of those discussed herein, may be configured to create a first learning environment on a remote student workstation or accessible by a remote student workstation for delivery of a first instructional
material to a student after the server authenticates a student log-in and a second learning environment on the remote student workstation or accessible on the remote student workstation for delivery of a second instructional material to the student after
the server authenticates the student log-in. The created first learning environment may display a first user interface to the student on the remote student workstation.  The first user interface may be used to interact with the first instructional
material when the student enters into a first learning session associated with the first course.  The created second learning environment may display a second user interface to the student on the remote student workstation.  The second user interface may
be used to interact with the second instructional material when the student enters into a second learning session associated with a second course.
<br/><br/> A database, such as any of those discussed herein, may store electronic addresses for a plurality of contacts associated with the student.  The student may be associated with a set of student's contacts comprising a first contact associated with
the first course and a second contact associated with the second course.  For example, the first contact may be a classmate of the student in the first course, and the second contact may be an instructor of the student in the second course.  However, the
first and second contacts could be any type of contact associated with the first and second courses, respectively.
<br/><br/> A networking service in communication with the server may be configured to display to the student, within the first learning environment, a first activity stream associated with the first contact, and configured to display to the student, within
the second learning environment, a second activity stream associated with the second contact.  Upon detection of student's entry into the first learning session, the first activity stream may be displayed without displaying the second activity stream,
and upon detection of student's entry into the second learning session, the second activity stream may be displayed without displaying the first activity stream.
<br/><br/> This type of filtering may be implemented according to one or more of the following configurations.  In some embodiments, the first activity stream may comprise a first message transmitted from the first contact, the second activity streams
comprises a second message transmitted from the second contact, or any combination thereof.  The first message may be transmitted from the first contact to the student, the second message may be transmitted from the second contact to the student, or any
combination thereof.  A message corresponding to the second activity stream may be transmitted to the student upon detection of student's exit from the learning session.  At least one of the first activity stream or second activity stream may comprise a
message transmitted from the student.  The first activity stream may comprise a first status update from the first contact, the second activity stream comprises a second status update from the second contact, or any combination thereof.  The first
instructional material may be concurrently displayed with the first activity stream, the second instructional material may be concurrently displayed with the second activity stream, or any combination thereof.  The first contact may be associated with
another first course student, a first course instructor, a first course performance assessor, a first course developer, or a first course administrator.  The second contact may be associated with a second course student, a second course instructor, a
second course performance assessor, a second course developer, or a second course administrator.  The first activity stream may comprise a live stream, the second activity stream or comprise a live stream, or any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> Either type of filtering, i.e. filtering by the student or filtering by the system, may allow the system to avoid sending updates or buddy lists that are not being used because the updates or users have been filtered out.  As a result, the
system may avoid sending extraneous data regarding updates that the user will not even see.

changing the user's preferences and settings.  Managing the user's preferences and settings will be discussed in conjunction with FIGS. 10-13.  Interface 800 may include a taskbar item 855 and a window control widget 860.
<br/><br/> Taskbar item 855 may be displayed in the taskbar of interface 800 and is a method for easily returning to the "My Info" section.  Window control widget 860 may be used to close the "My Info" section, minimize the "My Info" section such that
taskbar item 855 is the only on-screen representation of the "My Info" section, or scale the "My Info" section into a window size smaller than the portion it is currently shown to occupy.  Additional taskbar items may be used for other interface elements
of educational system 200.  For example, when a course is open, the course may have a taskbar item associated with it.  An example is disclosed in FIG. 14, taskbar item 1415.  As more content pages are open, additional taskbar items may be added to the
taskbar.  Similarly, window control widget 860 may be used with other content pages in the manner disclosed herein.
<br/><br/> Public Profile
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 depicts an exemplary interface 900 in accordance with one or more embodiments.  Interface 900 may include content section 905 and contact widget 970.  Content section 905 may display the public profile for a user of the system.  The
public profile for a user may include any combination information viewable by other members of the system.  In one embodiment, the public profile may include a user's name, email address, track or tracks of study, course year, location, description,
"about me," activities, interests, and communities.  The public profile for a user may be displayed when a user clicks on the user in the social pane or update stream.  For example, clicking on user 920 may cause that user's public profile to be
displayed in content section 905.
<br/><br/> Contact widget 970 may provide links to different ways of contacting the person associated with the contact widget 970.  Contact widget 970 may include links to initiate sending an email to the user, starting a chat with the user, or adding the

<br/><br/> In other embodiments, a user may be restricted in a manner from communicating with another user.  The restrictions may be based on rules or flags set store in student database 225, social network database 235, or security database 240.  The
rules or flags may include prohibiting interactions, chatting, viewing profiles, viewing stream updates, any other interaction made possible by education system 200, or any combination thereof.  The restriction may be based on a user's age, location,
nationality, course of study, progress, institutional policy, any information stored in the databases of the system, or any combination thereof.  For example, connection layer module 450 may prevent users from two separate countries from seeing each
other's' presence on educational system 200.  In another example, the connection layer module 450 may prevent users over a certain age from chatting with users under the certain age.
<br/><br/> Connection layer module 450 may translate communications from a first user in a first language into second language for a second user.  Connection layer module 450 may review any or all of the communications in educational system 200. 
Connection layer module 450 may determine that the first user is communicating in a first language based on the communications coming from the first user or from language settings associated with the second user.  Connection layer module 450 may
determine that the second user is communicating in a second language based on the communications coming from the second user or from language settings associated with the second user.  If the connection layer module 450 determines that the first and
second languages are different, the connection layer module 450 may use machine translation techniques to transfer messages from the first user into the second language for the second user, to transfer messages from the second user into the first
language for the first user, or any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> An online learning management system, such as any of those described herein, may provide courses to users that speak different languages or are located in different countries around the world.  Based on differences between laws in different
regions, business reasons, or other considerations, a user may be restricted in a manner from communicating with another user.  The restrictions may be based on rules or flags stored by the system.  The rules or flags may include prohibiting
interactions, chatting, viewing profiles, viewing stream updates, any other interaction made possible by the system.  The restriction may be based on a user's age, location, nationality, course of study, progress, institutional policy, or any other
information stored in the databases of the system.  For example, the system may prevent users from two separate countries from seeing each other's presence on the educational system.  In another example, the system may prevent users over a certain age
from chatting with users under the certain age.
<br/><br/> The educational system may also translate course materials or communications from a first user in a first language into second language for a second user.  The system may review any or all of the communications in system and may determine that
the first user is communicating in a first language based on the communications coming from the first user or from language settings associated with the first user.  The system may also determine that the second user is communicating in a second language
based on the communications coming from the second user or from language settings associated with the second user.  If the system determines that the first and second languages are different, the system may use machine translation techniques to translate
messages from the first user into the second language for the second user, to translate messages from the second user into the first language for the first user, or any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> The education system may comprise a server, a database, and a networking service.  The server may be configured to create corresponding learning environments on a plurality of geographically dispersed remote student workstations located in a
plurality of regions for delivery of instructional material from the server to a corresponding plurality of students after the server authenticates student log-ins.  For example, a first student may be located in a first region, e.g. USA, a second
student may be located in a second region, e.g. Russia, a third student may be located in a third region, e.g. Chile, and so on.  The region may be any of a country, nation, state, region, province, any geographically identifiable area, or any
combination thereof.  A region may also be an area defined by a language spoken in the region, by religion, by ethnicity, etc. Each of the created learning environments may display a user interface on a remote student workstation located in a region of
the plurality of regions.
<br/><br/> The database may store a plurality of region profiles.  Each region profile may contain information specifying rules associated with communication of information between a first region and another second region.
<br/><br/> The networking service may be in communication with the server and may be configured to communicate messages amongst the geographically dispersed remote student workstations located in the plurality of regions in accordance with the plurality of
region profiles.  The message may be any type of message or communication, including any of those discussed herein.  For example, the messages may include at least one of a message from a student, a message to a student, a student profile, a status of a
student, a stream update, or an instructional material.
<br/><br/> The profiles provide flexibility in being able to craft policies specific to various regions, and several possible configurations are possible.  A rule of at least one region profile may prevent communication of messages between a first student
in a first course and a second student in a second course.  A rules of at least one region profile may prevent communication of messages between a first student in a first region and a second student in a second region.  A rule of at least one region
profile may prevent communication of messages between a first student of a first educational institution and a second student of a second educational institution.  For example, students from a first college may be prevented from interacting with students
in a second college.  A rule of at least one region profile may prevent communication of messages between a student over a certain age and a student under the certain age.  A rule of at least one region profile may prevent communication of messages
between a first country and a second country.
<br/><br/> A rule of at least one region profile may cause a message in a first language of a first region to be translated into a second language of a second region.  The message may be translated using a machine translation technique, and may occur in
real-time.  For example, messages of a chat session between two users speaking different languages may be translated by the system during the chat session.  Similarly, updates to a stream or activity stream may be translated so that the stream displays
the translated messages.  Language settings for the user may be set in the user profile.
<br/><br/> Policies for Filtering or Analyzing Communications
<br/><br/> Policies module 445 may implement policies to filter information that is posted or groups that are created for inappropriate content.  Policies module 445 may receive a policy that is stored in student database 225, social network database 235,
or security database 240.  The policy may specify topics or words that are inappropriate content.  Policies module 445 may review any or all of the communications in educational system 200, and if the communication contains inappropriate content as
defined by the policy, policies module 445 may alter, redact, remove, replace, or delete the communication.
<br/><br/> Policies module 445 may analyze communications to identify topics that students are confused out.  In some embodiments, policies module 445 may receive a topic that is stored in student database 225, social network database 235, or security
database 240.  Policies module 445 may review any or all of the communications in educational system 200, and if a number of communications exceeds a threshold, the policies module 445 may identify the topic as a topic of confusion.
<br/><br/> In other embodiments, policies module may determine topics by summarizing content provided one or more users.  If a number of instances of topics exceeds a threshold, the policies module 445 may identify the topic as a topic of confusion. 
Alternatively, the content of the system may also be analyzed by using the summarization techniques described herein.  All or portions of the content of educational system 200, including but not limited to course materials, posts, contacts, and emails,
may be summarized to provide a number of instances of topics of the educational system 200.  If the number of topics exceeds a threshold, and the threshold is given as a different between the number of instances of a topic detected content provided by
one or more users and the number of instances of a topic detected when summarizing content of the system, the policies module 445 may identify the topic as a topic of confusion.
<br/><br/> If a topic of confusion is identified, policies module 445 my send a communication through educational system 200.  The communication may include an email, a post to a stream, a post to a community, a chat with a user, any communication type
available for users of the system, or any combination thereof.  The communication may be received by a user, an instructor, or educational system 200.
<br/><br/> Policies module 445 may discover unauthorized communication between students.  The unauthorized communication may include cheating, sharing answers, sharing assignments, sharing other course materials, or any combination thereof.  Policies
module 445 may receive a policy that is stored in student database 225, social network database 235, or security database 240.  The policy may specify objects that are unauthorized content.  Unauthorized content may include test answers, tests, course
materials, assignments, or any combination thereof.  Policies module 445 may review any or all of the communications in educational system 200, and if the communication contains objects that are unauthorized content, policies module 445 may alter,
redact, remove, replace, or delete the communication.  Further, policies module 445 may send a communication to an instructor or user that the unauthorized communication has been detected.  The sent communication may also include an indication of the
unauthorized object that had been shared.
<br/><br/> Cheating Prevention
<br/><br/> An online learning management system, such as any of those described herein, may include social networking features that allow students, faculty, or other users to communicate with one other while using other features provided by the system. 
The system may include a policy that specifies objects that are unauthorized content.  Unauthorized content may include test answers, tests, course materials, or assignments.  The system may monitor any or all of the communications in the system, and if
the communication contains objects that are unauthorized content, the system may alter, redact, remove, replace, or delete the communication.  Further, the system may send a communication to an instructor or user that the unauthorized communication has
been detected.  The sent communication may also include an indication of the unauthorized object that had been shared.
<br/><br/> The learning management system may comprise a server, such as any of those described herein, configured to create a learning environment on a remote student workstation or accessible by a remote station for delivery of instructional material to
a student after the server authenticates a student log-in. The created learning environment may display a user interface, such as any of those described herein, to the student on the remote student workstation.  The user interface may be used to interact
with an instructional material when the student enters into a learning session associated with a course.
<br/><br/> A networking service in communication with the server may communicate messages to or from the student from within the learning environment.  The messages may comprise any type of communication or message, include any of those or any combination
of those described herein.  The communication of messages with the student may be monitored to determine whether a message contains an unauthorized content.  Unauthorized content may be any item specified by the system as content that is not authorized
to be transmitted.  Not being authorized may be depended on the content itself, the potential recipient of the content or message, the transmitter of the content or message, or any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> Several possible actions may be taken by the system after detecting unauthorized content in messages.  The message containing the unauthorized content may be deleted, the message containing the unauthorized content may be redacted, the
unauthorized content may be deleted from the message prior to being received by the recipient, the unauthorized content may be redacted from the message prior to being received by the recipient, or any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> Upon detection of an unauthorized content, an alert message may be transmitted.  For example, an alert message may be transmitted to an instructor associated with the course, an assessor associated with the course, a faculty member associated
with the course, a course developer associated with the course, a or any combination thereof.  Additionally or alternatively, the alert may be transmitted to the student.
<br/><br/> The alert may contain one or more of the following: the unauthorized content, the identity of the sender, the identity of the intended recipient, the identity of any user that may have been exposed to the message and/or unauthorized content, or
time and/or date of the communication.
<br/><br/> Calendaring Based on Reference Date
<br/><br/> An online learning management system, such as any of those described herein, may provide courses to users.  The courses may be structured to have particular learning activities performed by the users by particular deadlines, e.g. turning in
homework by a certain time, taking a test before a certain date, completing reading assignments, etc. In order to provide flexibility in implementing courses with potentially varying start dates, the system may include a course framework that includes
relative deadlines for when tasks are due.  The course frameworks may resemble those used in the master course model of developing courses.  For example, a relative deadline may specify that a particular homework assignment is due on the third day of the
second week of the course.  When a user begins a course or a course start date is otherwise determined, the system may transform the relative dates into specific dates.  For example, given a course start date of Jan.  6, 2013, the system may translate
the relative date mentioned above into Jan.  15, 2013.  The system may then provide the course using the specific dates.  Course materials with specific dates may also be provided to users as a calendar, e.g. an .ics calendar file.  When transforming
relative dates into specific dates, the system may schedule around potential conflicts, such as holidays, weekends, breaks, designated reading periods, or any other date specified.  For example, the framework may recognize that certain dates fall on or
after July 4, and then move each of those dates on or after July 4 ahead one day.
<br/><br/> For example, when an individual instructor creates an online course, he/she can specify exact dates when assignments are due.  When online courses are centrally created and used for up to 5 years, and when those courses are re-used in multiple
classrooms over multiple terms, due-dates become far more complicated.  The system may be able to calculate learning activity due dates based on the following values: term-start date, the number of weeks after term-start on which the learning activity is
due, the number of days after the beginning of the week on which the learning activity is due, or any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> The system may be capable of displaying the learning activity--due dates in a calendar format within the Learning Management System.  This system may also be capable of generating calendar files that could be exported to the student's preferred
calendaring system, such as Microsoft Outlook or Google Calendar.
<br/><br/> When an individual instructor creates an online course, he/she can specify exact dates when learning activities are due.  When online courses are centrally created and used for up to years, and when those courses are re-used in multiple
classrooms over multiple terms, due-dates become far more complicated.  The system is be able to calculate learning activity due dates, e.g. based on the following values: term-start date, the number of weeks after term-start on which the assignment is
due, the number of days after the beginning of the week on which the assignment is due, or any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> This system would be capable of displaying the learning activity due dates in a calendar format within the Learning Management System.  This system would also be capable of generating calendar files that could be exported to the student's
preferred calendaring system such as Microsoft Outlook or Google Calendar
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a learning management system may comprise a database and a learning system, such as those discussed herein.  The database may store a framework, e.g. a course framework.  The framework may comprise a sequence of learning
units that are associated with a reference calendar for completion of the learning activity relative to a reference date.  The reference calendar may specify a reference due date for completing a learning activity associated with a learning unit of the
sequence of learning units, in which the reference due date is relative to the reference date.  For example, as discussed above, a learning activity may be associated with a reference due date of the second week of a course.  A learning activity may be
an assignment associated with a learning unit.
<br/><br/> FIG. 28 depicts exemplary calendars in accordance with one or more embodiments.  FIG. 28 may include reference calendar 2810 and actual calendar 2830.  Reference calendar may include a plurality of dates, including reference date 2815, reference
due date 2820, reference due date 2825, and reference date 2830.  Reference date 2815 may provide a frame of reference from which other dates, e.g. reference due dates 2820 and 2825 may be measured.  Reference due dates 2820 and 2825 may be dates on
which a learning activity is associated.  For example, a quiz may be due on reference due date 2820, and an assignment may be due on reference due date 2825.  For example, reference due date 2820 may be 8 days after reference due date 2815.
<br/><br/> The learning system may be configured to display a learning environment for delivery of instructional material associated with the sequence of learning units to a remote student workstation after the learning system authenticates a student at
the remote student workstation.  The displayed learning environment comprises a user interface displayed to the student, e.g. any of the user interfaces described herein.  The user interface may display an actual due date for completing the learning
activity, in which the actual due date is derived from the reference due date.
<br/><br/> Deriving the actual due date from the reference due date may be determined in various ways.  The actual due date may be determined by adding or subtracting the period of time between the reference due date from the reference date of the
reference calendar to the reference date of the actual calendar to arrive at the actual date.  Referring to FIG. 28, actual calendar 2830 may include a plurality of dates, including reference date 2815, actual due date 2840, date 2845, actual due date
2850, and date 2855.  The dates of actual calendar 2830 may be real calendar dates.  For example, date 2845 may correspond to Jul.  4, 2013, date 2850 may correspond to Jul.  5, 2013, and so on.  Reference date 2835 may correspond to the beginning of
reference calendar 2810, i.e. 2815.  Actual due date 2840 may be determined to be the date that is the same amount of time from reference date 2815 as reference due date 2820 is away from date 2815.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the determined actual due date may be modified based on a an adjustment date.  The actual due date may be based on an adjustment date on an actual calendar.  For example, the adjustment date may be based on a least one of a
day of a week, a day of a month, or a day of the year.  For example, the day of a week may be the fifth day of the week, a Tuesday, etc. A day of a month may be the fifth day of the month, the second Tuesday of the month, the first day of the second week
of the month, etc. Similarly, a day of the year may be specified using any technique for identifying a day during the year.
<br/><br/> The adjustment date may be used in various ways.  An adjustment date may specify that a particular day is not to available for scheduling an actual due date.  For example, if a relative due date, after being paired with a starting date, would
result in the actual due date landing on a holiday, e.g. July 4, then specifying July 4 as an adjustment date may result in the actual date being scheduled on a different day, e.g. July 3 or July 5.  In one or more embodiments, an adjustment date may be
removed consideration as an actual due date when determining the actual due date.
<br/><br/> Referring again to FIG. 28, date 2845 may be an adjustment date.  Adjustment date 2845 may be a holiday, e.g. July 4.  Adjustment date 2845 may be determined to be the date that is the same amount of time from reference date 2815 as reference
due date 2825 is away from date 2815.  However, because adjustment date 2845 is a holiday, and is specified as an adjustment date, the assignment corresponding to reference due date 2825 will not be assigned to 2845.  Instead, the learning activity
corresponding to reference due date 2825 may be mapped to actual due date 2850.
<br/><br/> The adjustment date may comprise a holiday on the actual calendar, a weekend day, or any other date specified as such.  The adjustment date may be based on at least one of a day of a week, a day of a month or a day of the year.  The adjustment
date may be specified by a system administrator, a course instructor, a course developer, or any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> FIG. 25 depicts an exemplary user interface displaying an actual due date for completing the learning activity, wherein the actual due date is derived from the reference due date.  For example, the actual due date may be displayed as the date on
which assignment icon 2520 is displayed.  Alternatively or additionally, the actual due date may be stored in a calendar file.
<br/><br/> In the learning management system, the set of learning activities may be associated with a course, in which the reference calendar defines a reference course completion time period, and in which the user interface displays an actual course
completion time period derived from the reference course completion time period.  For example, the reference course completion period may be the period on reference calendar 2810 from reference date 2815 to reference due date 2820, and the actual course
completion time period may be the period on actual calendar 2830 from reference date 2815 to actual due date 2840.
<br/><br/> Further, the course completion time period may be between a reference course start date and a reference course end date, in which the user interface displays at least one of an actual course start date or an actual course end date derived from a
respective one of the reference course start date and the reference course end date.  For example, the reference course start date may be 2815, the reference course end date may be reference date 2830, the actual course start date may be reference date
2815 on actual calendar 2830, and the actual course completion end date may be date 2855.
<br/><br/> Moreover, the course completion time period may be divided into a temporal sequence of reference learning unit completion sub-periods.  Each reference learning unit sub-period in the temporal sequence may be associated with a corresponding
learning unit in the sequence of learning units.  The user interface may display an actual learning unit sub-period derived from a reference learning unit sub-period.  For example, the period from reference due date 2825 to reference date 2830 may be
reference learning unit sub-period.  The period from actual due date 2850 to date 2855 of actual calendar 2830 may be an actual learning unit sub-period derived from the reference learning unit sub-period.
<br/><br/> Deriving the actual learning unit sub-period from the reference learning unit sub-period or the actual course completion time period from the reference course completion time period may be performed in various ways, including any of the
techniques discussed herein, such as those discussed in reference to deriving an actual due date from a reference due date.
<br/><br/> FIG. 29 depicts an exemplary logic flow for a method of managing learning in accordance with one or more embodiments.  In block 2910, electronic addresses for a plurality of contacts associated with a student may be stored.  In block 2920, the
student may be associated with a set of student's contacts comprising at least one student-selected contact and at least one mandatory contact, wherein a student-selected contact comprises a contact designated by the student to be in the set of student's
contacts and a mandatory contact comprises a contact that is not designated by the student to be in the set of student's contacts.  In block 2930, one or more instructional materials may be delivered to the student.  In block 2940, a user interface that
enables the student to communicate messages with the student-selected contact and the mandatory contact may be provided.

a second electronic address may be associated with a second contact.  The first contact may be associated with the learning session and the second contact may not be associated with the learning session.  In block 3030, a first activity stream associated
with the first contact and a second activity stream associated with the second contact may be displayed to the student.  Upon detection of student's entry into the learning session, the first activity stream may be displayed without displaying the second
activity stream.  Upon detection of student's exit from the learning session, the second activity stream may be displayed either with displaying the first activity stream or without displaying the first activity stream.
<br/><br/> FIG. 30B depicts an exemplary logic flow for a method of managing learning in accordance with one or more embodiments.  In block 3040, a first instructional material may be delivered to a student when the student enters into a first learning
session associated with a first course.  In block 3050, a second instructional material may be delivered to the student when the student enters a second learning session associated with a second course.  In block 3060, electronic addresses for a
plurality of contacts associated with the student may be stored.  The student may be associated with a set of student's contacts comprising a first contact associated with the first course and a second contact associated with the second course.  In block
3070, a first activity stream associated with the first contact and a second activity stream associated with the second contact may be displayed to the student.  Upon detection of student's entry into the first learning session, the first activity stream
may be displayed without displaying the second activity stream.  Upon detection of student's entry into the second learning session, the second activity stream may be displayed without displaying the first activity stream.
