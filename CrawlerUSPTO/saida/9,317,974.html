<br/><br/> Rendering a digital element associated with a physical region is disclosed.  For example, a digital element such as a message, a record, a digital file, or a coupon is placed by a user for a specific geographical location.  The digital element
may be retrieved by one or more users by visiting the geographical location and using a computing device application to retrieve the digital element.  In some embodiments, an augmented reality is displayed using the computing device and a user desiring
to retrieve the digital element may view a visual representation of the digital element at the physical location where the digital element was placed.  For example, the user may explore a physical location using a mobile device application as a viewer. 
If any digital element of interest exists in the physical location shown in the viewer, an icon representing the digital element is superimposed on the view of the physical location to create an augmented reality view of the digital element being located
at the physical location.  In some embodiments, the representation of the digital element is associated with an audio and/or tactile feedback.  For example, an audio and/or tactile feedback may be provided via the device to indicate the digital element. 
If a user desires to obtain the digital element, the user may indicate that the user desires to obtain the digital element shown in the viewer of the mobile device application.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a system for rendering a digital element.  Device 102 is connected to server 106 via network 104.  Device 102 may include one or more of the following: a smartphone, a tablet computer, a
mobile device, a media player, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, and any other computing device.  Device 102 includes application 108, sensor 110, and storage 112.  In some embodiments, device 102 is used by a user to place and/or retrieve a digital
element.  Application 108 may include a software application that can be utilized to place, retrieve, and/or open a digital element.  In some embodiments, application 108 includes a web browser.  In some embodiments, application 108 includes a native
application (e.g., Apple iOS application or Google Android application) for placing and/or retrieving a digital element.  Sensor 110 may include one or more sensors: a location sensor, a Global Positioning System (GPS) sensor, a wireless local area
(Wifi) network sensor, accelerometer, a gyroscope sensor, a device orientation sensor, a light sensor, a camera (e.g, visual pattern matching of location), a proximity sensor, and a microphone.  In some embodiments, information from the sensor is used to
place, retrieve, and/or display a digital element.  For example, a current location and orientation of device 102 is obtained from sensor 110 and this information is used to determine which digital element to render on a screen of device 110.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, storage 112 stores configuration information, preferences, content, cached information, a list/database, and/or other information associated with one or more digital elements.  For example, storage 112 includes user
configuration information and a cached database of digital elements located near device 102.  In some embodiments, device 102 provides an augmented reality view displayed on a screen of device 102.  For example, an environment such as an image captured
by a camera (e.g., sensor 110) of device 102 is modified to include a visual, sonic (e.g., audio) and/or somatic (e.g., tactile) representation of a digital element placed at a physical location depicted in the captured image.  A user may navigate the
augmented reality view by moving device 102 in the physical world and a corresponding view of the physical world captured by the camera of device 102 is augmented with visual, audio and tactile (e.g., haptic feedback) representations of digital elements
at appropriate locations and displayed on a screen of device 102.  In some embodiments, rather than using images from a camera of device 102 to display the augmented reality world, a previously captured image and/or a virtual image may be utilized.  In
some embodiments, a user may retrieve/capture a digital element by performing a gesture with device 102 at an appropriate physical location by performing an input movement (e.g., touch detected on a touch screen of device 102 or a specific physical
movement of device 102 detected by sensor 110).
<br/><br/> Server 106 may include a web server, a virtual server, and/or any other server that can provide information to device 102.  In some embodiments, device 102 obtains information from server 106 via network 104.  In some embodiments, application
108 communicates with server 106 to obtain one or more digital elements located near a location detected by sensor 110.  For example, a location detected by sensor 110 is provided to server 106 and server 106 provides a list of digital elements (e.g.,
obtained from storage 114) that are located near the location and allowed to be accessed by a user of device 102.  Device 102 renders a visual representation of the digital elements at appropriate locations within an augmented reality world view.  When a
user of device 102 selects a specific digital element, device 102 requests the specific digital element and the requested digital element is provided by server 106 from storage 114 and/or from a cached or local storage such as storage 112.  Storage 114
is connected to server 106.  Storage 114 may store user account information, digital elements, metadata associated with digital elements, and/or any other information associated with digital elements.  For example, storage 114 includes a database
repository of digital elements.  In some embodiments, when a digital element is placed at a physical location using device 102, the digital element is provided to server 106 for storage in storage 114.  In some embodiments, one or more placed digital
elements may be private (e.g., only stored in storage 112) to device 102 and not provided to server 106 for storage.  In some embodiments, storage 114 is directly connected to network 104 and server 106 may access storage 114 via network 104.
<br/><br/> Examples of network 104 include one or more of the following: a direct or indirect physical communication connection, mobile communication network, Internet, intranet, Local Area Network, Wide Area Network, Storage Area Network, and any other
form of connecting two or more systems, components, or storage devices together.  In various embodiments, the components shown in FIG. 1 may exist in various combinations of hardware machines.  One or more of the components shown in FIG. 1 may be
included in the same machine.  Other communication paths may exist and the example of FIG. 1 has been simplified to illustrate the example clearly.  Although single instances of components have been shown to simplify the diagram, additional instances of
any of the components shown in FIG. 1 may exist.  For example, multiple devices may be communicating with multiple servers that may be utilizing a cluster of server storage.  Additional applications may be hosted by client 102.  Components not shown in
FIG. 1 may also exist.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating an embodiment of a rendered visual representation of a digital element.  Device 202 is a smartphone device.  In some embodiments, device 202 is included in device 102 of FIG. 1.  Device 202 includes screen 204
showing an augmented reality view of environment 200.  Specifically, screen 204 is showing a train station platform and the view of the train station platform has been augmented with a display of a visual representation of digital element 206 placed at a
physical location of the train station platform.  A user may have discovered digital element 206 by moving device 202 around environment 200.  As device 202 is moved around environment 200, display 204 displays a view of environment 200.  The view of
environment 200 may have been obtained from a camera of device 202 and/or a previously captured/generated visual image.  Digital element 206 was placed at the physical location by a user.  The same or different user may obtain digital element 206 by
visiting the physical location and finding the device through a display of a device, as shown in FIG. 2.  Digital element 206 is represented by a graphical "kiss" icon.
<br/><br/> In order to obtain the digital element 206 displayed on screen 204, a user may perform a gesture with device 202.  For example, a user may be required to swing device 202 in a semicircular motion to act out capturing digital element 206
displayed on screen 204.  In some embodiments, when digital element 206 is obtained, a message associated with digital element 206 may be obtained.  For example, digital element 206 represents a text message left for a user of device 202 by another user
that has previously visited the physical location of digital element 206.  In some embodiments, although a visual representation of a digital element can be seen on a display viewer screen, the digital element may not be able to be obtained until the
device is closer to a location of the digital element.  For example, as the device is moved closer to the location of the digital element, a visual representation of the digital element becomes larger.  In some embodiments, when the digital element is
able to be obtained, an indication is provided.  For example, the visual representation may blink, move, wiggle, glow, pulsate, and/or change color to indicate that the element can be obtained.  In some embodiments, device 202 may vibrate and/or emit a
sound to indicate that the element can be obtained.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a process for placing a digital element.  The process of FIG. 3 may be implemented on device 102 and/or server 106 of FIG. 1.  At 302, a selection of a digital element is received.  In some
embodiments, receiving the selection of the digital element includes receiving an indication of a digital element to be placed.  Examples of the digital element include one or more of the following: a text, a message, an image, an audio, a video, a
route, a location identifier, a link, an icon, a coupon, a key, a geographical reference, a file, a promotion, an advertisement, a monetary object, and an interactive element.  For example, a user may select to leave a message for another user.  In
another example, a user may select to leave a personal record to remember about a particular location.  In another example, a user may select to leave a clue and/or a digital key that can be used to determine/access content in a scavenger hunt.  In
another example, a user may select to leave a coupon that can be redeemed to obtain a specified item from a merchant.  In another example, a user may select to leave an interactive element that guides a receiver of the digital element to one or more
locations (e.g., tour, on screen guidance, an arrow, on screen bird that a user can follow by physically moving to a location on a flight path of the on screen bird, etc.).  In various embodiments, a digital element may be utilized to provide one or more
of the following: a guided tour, a game, a gift, record a memory, record an event at a physical location, a coupon, a promotion, an advertisement, an event, an educational experience, an exercise, a checkpoint, a waypoint, and a social experience.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a user may select a type of digital content from a list of possible digital elements to place.  In some embodiments, a user may generate a new type of digital element to place.  In some embodiments, a type of digital element
that can be left is determined based on one or more factors.  For example, only certain type(s) of digital content may be placed at a particular location.  Examples of the factors used to determine the type of digital content that can be left include one
or more of the following: information obtained from one or more sensors of a user device (e.g., information from sensor 110 of FIG. 1), a status associated with a physical location, a time value, a temperature, a location where the digital content is to
be placed, a user preference, a user account setting, a user privilege, a user status, information associated with a user placing the digital element, information associated with an intended recipient of the digital element, other digital elements at or
near the physical location, information obtained from an Internet source, and information obtained from a server (e.g., information from server 106 of FIG. 1).
<br/><br/> At 304, a configuration of the digital element is received.  In some embodiments, the configuration includes a specification of a visual representation of the digital element to be placed.  For example, an icon, a color and a size to be used to
represent the digital element may be received.  In some embodiments, the configuration includes a specification of one or more configuration parameters specific to the type of digital content to be placed.  For example, a text content of a message to be
left is received.  In another example, a file to be left is received.  In another example, a specification of an item, a quantity, and a merchant of a redeemable coupon are received.  In some embodiments, the configuration includes a specification of
which user(s) may retrieve the digital content to be placed.  In some embodiments, a user may specify that the digital content can be retrieved by everyone (i.e., public), only by the user placing the digital content (i.e., private), only by members
belonging to one or more specified groups, or only by specified users.  In some embodiments, the configuration includes one or more time parameters associated with the digital element.  For example, a user may provide a time period when the digital
content can be retrieved.  In some embodiments, the configuration includes a specification of a restriction on the number of times the digital element can be retrieved.  In some embodiments, the configuration includes a specification of how to notify
potential receiver(s) of the digital element to be placed.  For example, a user is able to send a notification (e.g., email, instant message, SMS, Twitter Tweet, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> posting, etc.) of the existence of the digital element to one or more users and
configure whether an alert (e.g., vibration, sound, visual alert, etc.) will be provided when a user who is able to retrieve the digital element is near the physical location of the digital element.
<br/><br/> At 306, a location associated with the digital element is determined.  In some embodiments, the location is at least in part determined to be a current physical location of a device being used to place the digital element.  In some embodiments,
at least a portion of the location of the digital element to be placed is automatically determined using one or more of the following associated with the device being used to place the digital element: GPS data, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a Wifi
positioning data, a cellular signal positioning data, a captured image (e.g., machine vision utilizing visual pattern matching to determine location), a captured audio, and a user provided location identifier.  In some embodiments, the digital element is
only allowed to be placed at the physical location of the device being used to place the digital element.  In some embodiments, the digital element may be placed within a geographical boundary associated with the device being used to place the digital
element.  For example, the digital element may be placed within a specified distance from the location of the device.  In some embodiments, the digital element may be placed in any location regardless of the device location.  In some embodiments, the
digital element may be placed at a location specified by a user.  For example, a user may select a location from a map where the digital element is to be placed.  In some embodiments, a user may specify a location within an environment view displayed on
the device.  For example, a user may select a location in an image captured by a camera on the device.  In some embodiments, the location of the digital element includes a location point.  In some embodiments, the location of the digital element includes
a region.  In some embodiments, the location associated with digital element is dynamically modified.  For example, a region associated with the digital element becomes smaller and/or larger based at least in part on a time value, an elapsed time, a
number of times the digital element has been obtained, and/or any other changing factor.  In some embodiments, the location of the digital element includes a specification of one or more of the following: a latitude, a longitude, an elevation, a region
shape, and a region.
<br/><br/> At 308, the digital element is finalized for placement.  In some embodiments, finalizing the digital element includes associating the provided digital element with the determined location to enable one or more users to retrieve the digital
element from the location.  In some embodiments, finalizing the digital element for placement includes storing the digital element and/or metadata associated with the digital element in a storage such as storage 112 and/or 114 of FIG. 1.  In some
embodiments, finalizing the digital element for placement includes receiving at a server from a user device the digital element and/or metadata associated with the digital element.  In some embodiments, finalizing the digital element for placement
includes associating the digital element with one or more user accounts.  For example, the digital element is associated with an identifier that identifies a user account of a user that created the digital element and one or more other identifiers
identify user account(s) of one or more other users that are able to access the digital element.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 4A-4E are diagrams illustrating an example user interface used to place a digital element.  In some embodiments, FIGS. 4A-4E illustrate at least a portion of the process of FIG. 3.  FIG. 4A shows a user holding device 402 that is running
an application that can be used to place a digital element.  In some embodiments, device 402 is device 102 of FIG. 1.  Screen 404 is displaying a list of types of digital elements that can be placed.  FIG. 4B shows screen 406 that is displaying a
configuration screen after a "KISS" type of digital element has been selected by a user on screen 404 of FIG. 4A.  The "KISS" type of digital element may be configured to be sent to one or more selected users by selecting the "Send to friend" option on
screen 406.  The "KISS" type of digital element may be configured to be publicly available to any user by selecting the "Broadcast publicly" option on screen 406.  The "KISS" type of digital element may be personalized by selecting the "Personalise"
option on screen 406.  FIG. 4C shows screen 408 that is displaying personalization options after the "Personalise" option was selected on screen 406 of FIG. 4B.  The "KISS" digital element may be personalized by adding a personal text message (e.g., by
selecting the "Add message" option), changing the color of the visual representation of the digital element (e.g., by selecting the "Colour" option), changing the shading pattern of the visual representation of the digital element (e.g., by selecting the
"Pattern" option), and a personal photograph may be attached to the "KISS" digital element (e.g., by selecting the "Attach photo" option).  After the digital element has been configured and personalized, FIG. 4D shows screen 410 that is displaying
options to determine a physical location associated with the digital element.  By selecting the "Here" option, a geographical location of the device may be automatically determined (e.g., using GPS, Wifi and/or Cellular signal location data) and
associated with the digital element.  By selecting the "Use google maps" option, a geographical location of the device may be provided by a user by selecting a location on a displayed map.  FIG. 4E shows screen 412 confirming the placement of the digital
element after the location of the digital element has been determined.  Screen 412 confirms that the "KISS" digital element has been placed at "Baker Street Station" by user "Sarah Roberts."
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a process for retrieving a digital element.  In some embodiments, at least a portion of FIG. 5 is used to retrieve a digital element left using at least a portion of the process of FIG. 3.  The
process of FIG. 5 may be implemented on device 102 of FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> At 502, a user is authenticated.  In some embodiments, authenticating the user includes verifying a user account identifier and a password.  For example, a user executes application 108 and provides a user identifier and a password to log into
one or more services of server 106 of FIG. 1.  In some embodiments, authenticating the user includes sending a user account identifier and password to a server and receiving a verification that the user account has been authenticated.  In some
embodiments, the user account is associated with one or more preferences/configurations and the preferences/configurations associated with the authenticated user are obtained from a storage such as storage 112 and/or storage 114 of FIG. 1.  For example,
the user account is associated with user configuration of desired digital elements (e.g., desired digital elements to be notified when physically near the digital elements), allowed digital elements (e.g., digital elements allowed to be obtained by the
user of the user account), and/or one or more other associated users (e.g., user has access to one or more digital elements placed by friend users or other allowed users).  In some embodiments, a user may subscribe to digital elements of another user. 
For example, a celebrity user may make the celebrity user's digital element public and allow a subscribing user access to the celebrity user's digital elements and is notified of the celebrity user's digital elements.
<br/><br/> At 504, a location associated with the user is determined.  In some embodiments, determining the location includes determining a physical location of a device that is to be used to obtain a digital element.  For example, determining the physical
location includes determining the physical location of device 102 of FIG. 1.  In some embodiments, determining the location includes automatically determining a location using one or more of the following: GPS data, an IP address, a WiFi positioning
data, a cellular signal positioning data, a captured image (e.g., machine vision utilizing visual pattern matching to determine location), a captured audio, and a user provided location identifier.  In some embodiments, a user may specify a location
identifier.  For example, a user may select a location from a map.  In some embodiments, the location cannot be specified by a user and must be determined using detected information.  In some embodiments, determining the location includes at least in
part detecting a location and at least in part receiving a user provided location identification.  For example, a general location is detected using one or more location sensors and a user is provided a plurality of possible locations within the general
location for selection.  In some embodiments, determining the location includes using information from sensor 110 of FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> At 506, based on the determined location and user configuration, matching digital elements are requested.  In some embodiments, using the user configuration associated with the authenticated user in 502 and location determined in 504, a request
is made to obtain a list of digital elements that match a desired criteria.  For example, the user configuration includes an identification of one or more types, users, distance values, and/or other filters/preferences associated with digital elements
desired by a user.  The determined location may be used to identify relevant digital elements that are near the determined location (e.g., within a predetermined, user configured, and/or dynamically determined distance from the determined location).  In
some embodiments, requesting the matching digital elements includes sending the request to a server such as server 106 of FIG. 1.  In some embodiments, requesting the matching digital elements includes obtaining a list of matching digital elements from a
storage such as storage 112 and/or storage 114 of FIG. 1.  In some embodiments, matching digital elements are requested based on the determined location and a user identifier.  For example, any digital element within a predetermined, configured and/or
dynamically determined distance from the determined location that are allowed to be received by a user of the user identifier is requested.
<br/><br/> At 508, an identification of one or more elements is received.  In some embodiments, receiving the identification includes receiving a list of one or more elements that match a criteria.  In some embodiments, the identification identifies
digital elements that match information provided in 506.  For example, the identification includes a list of obtainable digital elements that are located within a predetermined, configurable and/or dynamically determined distance from the provided
location.  In some embodiments, the identification only identifies digital elements that are allowed to be obtained by an identified user.  For example, a provided user identifier is used to obtain user account information and the user account
information (e.g., user preferences, associated users, other/previous digital elements placed/obtained by the user, etc.) is used (e.g., by a server) to determine a list of digital elements allowed to be accessed by the user.  In some embodiments, the
identification identifies digital elements based at least in part on a status associated with a determined location and/or a digital element.  For example, one or more elements may be obtained a predetermined amount of times and an element may have
reached the predetermined limit.  In another example, one or more elements may only be obtained at a specified time and the element(s) are identified in the identification if a current time matches the specified time.  In another example, one or more
elements may only be obtained at a specified weather condition (e.g., specified temperature, precipitation, etc.) and the element(s) are identified in the identification if a current weather of the determined location matches the specified weather
condition.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, one or more elements may only be obtained by one or more allowed users and the element(s) are identified in the identification if a user is included in the allowed users.  In some embodiments, the identification is received
from a storage such as storage 112 and/or storage 114 of FIG. 1.  In some embodiments, the identification is received from a server such as server 106 of FIG. 1.  In some embodiments, the identification includes contents of digital element(s) identified
by the identification.  In some embodiments, the identification includes metadata associated with the digital element(s) identified by the identification.  Examples of the metadata include information about a digital element, a rule defining how and/or
when a digital element can be obtained (e.g., time restriction associated with a digital element), information about a visual representation of a digital element (e.g., image/animation to be rendered to display a visual representation of a digital
element in an augmented reality view), information about a sonic representation of a digital element (e.g., sound to be rendered to indicate a representation of a digital element in an augmented reality world), information about a somatic representation
of a digital element (e.g., tactile/haptic feedback to be rendered to indicate a representation of a digital element in an augmented reality world) and information about a notification associated with a digital element (e.g., vibration or sound
notification, if any, when near a digital element).  In some embodiments, one or more digital elements identified in the received identification are selected using one or more user preferences.  For example, a user may be only interested in a specified
type of digital element.  In another example, a user may be only interested in digital element(s) placed by a specific user.  In some embodiments, the identification of one or more elements is periodically and/or dynamically received.  For example, as a
physical location of a device receiving the identification changes and/or as digital elements are updated, updated identification is received as updated and/or at a periodic interval.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, one or more digital elements identified in the identification are associated with a notification.  For example, a user of a device may not be actively paying attention to the device and/or an application such as application
108 of FIG. 1 that can be used to obtain digital elements.  When the device is physically located within a distance (e.g., a predetermined, configurable, and/or dynamically determined distance) from a location where a digital element identified in the
identification is placed, a notification may be provided using the device to alert a user that a digital element of interest is located near the device.  Examples of the notification include audio, tactile (e.g., vibration), and visual notifications.  In
some embodiments, at least a portion of a configuration on whether and/or how to provide the notification for a particular digital element may be included in the identification received in 508.  In some embodiments, at least a portion of a configuration
on whether and/or how to provide the notification for a particular digital element may be obtained from a user preference and/or user account information.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a process for rendering a digital element.  In some embodiments, the process of FIG. 6 is at least in part included in step 508 of FIG. 5.  The process of FIG. 6 may be at least in part
implemented in device 102 of FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> At 602, a digital element to render is selected.  In some embodiments, selecting the digital element includes receiving at least a portion of the identification received in 508 of FIG. 5.  For example, an obtainable digital element within a
preconfigured distance is selected.  In some embodiments, the digital element to be rendered is associated with an augmented reality view to be displayed on a screen of a device such as device 102 of FIG. 1.  For example, an identification of digital
element(s) physically located near the device was received in step 508 of FIG. 5 and stored in a storage such as storage 112 of FIG. 1.  A user may utilize the device to display an augmented reality view of the surrounding physical location, and if a
digital element identified in the identification is physically located in the location to be displayed in the augmented reality view, the digital element is selected to be rendered.  In some embodiments, selecting the digital element includes comparing a
detected physical location and orientation of a device with placement locations associated with identified digital elements and selecting one or more digital elements that are within physical view of the device (e.g., located at a location depicted in an
image captured with a camera of the device).
<br/><br/> At 604, a visual representation associated with the selected digital element is determined.  In some embodiments, determining the visual representation includes determining an image and/or animation to be displayed in an augmented reality view
to indicate a presence of a digital element at a location.  In some embodiments, at least a portion of the specification of the visual representation is included in data selected in 602.  In some embodiments, at least a portion of the specification of
the visual representation is included in data received from a server, such as identification data received in step 508 of FIG. 5.  The visual representation may include an image, an animation, an icon, a color specification, a size specification, and a
notification to provide to indicate the digital element may be obtained.  In some embodiments, determining the visual representation includes scaling and/or modifying (e.g., using visual perspective rules) an image/animation representation of the
selected digital element based on a relative location of the digital element with respect to a distance and/or orientation of a device to render the visual representation.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a sonic representation associated with the selected digital element is determined.  In some embodiments, determining the sonic representation includes determining an audio to be produced in an augmented reality world to
indicate a presence of a digital element at a location.  In some embodiments, determining the sonic representation includes scaling and/or modifying an audio representation of the selected digital element based on a relative location of the digital
element with respect to a distance and/or orientation of a device to render the audio representation.  For example, a volume and/or tone of the audio representation may be increased as the digital element is located relatively closer to the device, and
the volume and/or tone of the audio representation may be decreased as the digital element is located relatively further away from the device.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a somatic representation associated with the selected digital element is determined.  In some embodiments, determining the somatic representation includes determining a tactile/haptic feedback to be produced in an augmented
reality world to indicate a presence of a digital element at a location.  In some embodiments, determining the somatic representation includes scaling and/or modifying a tactile/haptic representation of the selected digital element based on a relative
location of the digital element with respect to a distance and/or orientation of a device to render the somatic representation.  For example, an intensity and/or pattern of the tactile/haptic representation may be increased as the digital element is
located relatively closer to the device, and the intensity and/or pattern of the tactile/haptic representation may be decreased as the digital element is located relatively further away from the device.
<br/><br/> At 606, a rendering location associated with the selected digital element is determined.  In some embodiments, determining the rendering location includes determining the placement location of the selected digital element.  In some embodiments,
at least a portion of the rendering location is included in data selected in 602.  In some embodiments, at least a portion of the rendering location is included in data received from a server, such as identification data received at step 508 of FIG. 5. 
In some embodiments, the rendering location includes one or more of the following: a latitude, a longitude, an elevation, a region shape, and a region.  In some embodiments, a default elevation value is utilized.  In some embodiments, determining the
location includes determining a location within an augmented reality view that corresponds to the placement location of the digital element.  In some embodiments, the location associated with digital element is dynamically modified.  For example, a
region associated with the digital element becomes smaller and/or larger based at least in part on a time value, an elapsed time, a number of times the digital element has been obtained, and/or any other changing factor.
<br/><br/> At 608, a world view associated with a location and an orientation of a device is determined.  In some embodiments, the world view is to be augmented to provide the augmented reality view with a rendered visual, sonic and/or somatic
representation of a digital element.  In some embodiments, an image captured by a camera (e.g., sensor 110 of FIG. 1) of the device is to be modified to include a visual representation of the digital element placed at a location depicted in the captured
image.  A user may navigate the augmented reality world by moving the device in the physical world and a corresponding view of the physical world captured by the camera of the device is augmented with visual, sonic and/or somatic representations of
digital elements at appropriate locations and displayed on a screen of the device.  In some embodiments, rather than using images from a camera of the device to display the augmented reality world, determining the world view that includes obtaining a
previously captured image and/or a virtual image may be utilized (e.g., an image matching a current location and orientation of the device).
<br/><br/> At 610, the determined visual representation of the digital element is rendered over the determined world view.  In some embodiments, rendering the visual representation includes superimposing the visual representation of the digital element
(e.g., appropriately scaled/skewed following visual perspective rules) based on a distance between a viewing device and digital element location at the appropriate location on the determined world view corresponding to the location of the digital
element.  The created augmented reality view displays the digital element as being placed within the augmented reality world.  As the device moves closer to the location of the digital element, the visual representation of the digital element may be
scaled (e.g., to become larger) to follow visual perspective rules in creating an illusion that the user approaching closer to the digital element.  In some embodiments, the rendering of the digital element is associated with an audio and/or tactile
feedback.  For example, an audio and/or tactile feedback may be provided via the device to indicate the digital element.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a process for retrieving a rendered digital element.  The process of FIG. 7 may be at least in part implemented in device 102 and/or sever 106 of FIG. 1.  In some embodiments, the process of
FIG. 7 is used at least in part to obtain content of a digital element rendered in an augmented reality view.  For example, the process of FIG. 6 is used to provide a rendered view of a digital element that may be obtained.  In some embodiments, although
a visual representation of a digital element can be seen on a display screen, the digital element may not be able to be obtained until the device is closer to a location of the digital element.  For example, as the device is moved closer to the location
of the digital element, a visual, sonic and/or somatic representation of the digital element becomes larger.  In some embodiments, when the digital element is able to be obtained, an indication is provided.  For example, the visual representation may
blink, glow, pulsate, and/or change color to indicate that the element can be obtained.  In some embodiments, the device may vibrate and/or emit a sound to indicate that the element can be obtained.
<br/><br/> At 702, an indication of a selected digital element is received.  In some embodiments, a displayed digital element that is able to be obtained may be selected to be obtained by providing a gesture input.  For example, a visual representation of
a digital element that is displayed in an augmented reality view may be selected by a user to be obtained at least in part by touching the visual representation on a touch screen display.  In some embodiments, a user may perform a movement/gesture (e.g.,
detected using an accelerometer, orientation sensor, compass, and/or gyroscope) with a device rendering the digital element to select a digital element to be obtained.  For example, a user may be required to swing the device in a semicircular motion to
act out capturing the rendered digital element.  In another example, a user may be required to rub the visual representation of the desired digital element displayed on a touchscreen surface to act out scratching a scratch card to reveal the digital
element contents.
<br/><br/> At 704, the indication is processed.  In some embodiments, processing the indication includes determining an identifier of the selected digital element.  In some embodiments, processing the indication includes determining how and/or where to
obtain contents of the selected digital element.  In some embodiments, processing the digital element includes modifying and/or storing data associated with the digital element to indicate that the digital element has been retrieved by a specified user. 
In some embodiments, processing the digital element includes verifying that the selected digital element is allowed to be obtained by the user.  In some embodiments, processing the indication includes obtaining contents of the selected digital element. 
In some embodiments, the contents may be obtained from a storage such as storage 112 and/or storage 114 of FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> At 706, contents of the selected digital element are provided.  In some embodiments, providing the contents includes displaying text, image, video, and/or other content associated with the digital element.  In some embodiments, providing the
contents includes displaying the contents using the application used to render the visual representation of the selected digital element.  In some embodiments, providing the contents includes opening the contents using a different application than the
application used to render the visual representation of the selected digital element.  For example, the contents include a spreadsheet file and the spreadsheet file is opened using a spreadsheet application.
<br/><br/> At 708, data associated with the selected digital element is received.  In some embodiments, data such as utilization statistics, utilization behavior, and other utilization metric associated with provided contents of the digital element and/or
other data of the digital element is received at a server such as server 106 of FIG. 1.  In some embodiments, the received data may be used to research utilization behavior.  In some embodiments, the provided data is used to update configurations
associated with the selected digital element.  For example, the selected digital element can be accessed a limited number of times and the configuration that tracks the number of times the digital element has been accessed is updated using the received
data.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 8A-8C are diagrams illustrating an example user interface used to retrieve a digital element.  In some embodiments, FIGS. 8A-C illustrate at least a portion of the process of FIGS. 5-7.  FIG. 8A shows a user holding device 802 that is
running an application that can be used to render and retrieve a digital element.  In some embodiments, device 802 is device 102 of FIG. 1.  Screen 804 is displaying a notification that another person has placed a "KISS" digital element (e.g., trace) at
the "Baker Street Station" location for the user of device 802.  In some embodiments, the notification shown in screen 804 is provided with an audio and/or tactile notification.  In some embodiments, the notification shown in screen 804 was provided when
