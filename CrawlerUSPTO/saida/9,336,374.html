<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> To allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs to further understand the present invention, content and efficacy to achieve of the present invention are described in detail below by using preferred
embodiments of the present invention with reference to accompanying drawings.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a block diagram of operations for authenticating a user of a smart phone according to the present invention.  In FIG. 1, a smart phone 10 used as a mobile device includes an orientation sensor 12, a touch screen sensor 14, and a touch
screen 22, and an authentication module 16 used for authenticating a user of the smart phone 10 includes a behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 and an authentication mechanism core element 20.
<br/><br/> If an operation mechanism and a module for authenticating a user of a smart phone of the present invention are embedded in an app (such as a <b><i>Facebook</i></b> app and a Gmail app), when a user uses the app, the smart phone 10 may sense all behavioral
information about holding of and operations on the mobile phone, where the holding and operations are executed for the app, so as to protect the app from being opened or operated by people other than a holder of the smart phone.  If the operation
mechanism and the module for authenticating a user of a smart phone are embedded in an operating system, the smart phone 10 may sense all behavioral information about holding and operations in the mobile phone, so as to protect a designated app or an
entire system from being opened or operated by people other than the holder of the smart phone.
<br/><br/> The authentication module 16 is built in an operating system or an application (app) of the smart phone 10, or is built in a server (not shown).  When the authentication module 16 is built in a server, several magnetic-axis azimuth angles, pitch
angles, left-right roll angles, and timestamps sensed by the orientation sensor 12 as well as several screen touch positions, screen touch areas, force values, and timestamps sensed by the touch screen sensor 14 are transferred to the behavioral
biometrics conversion element 18 through a network, and a result of classification and determination by the authentication mechanism core element 20 is transferred to the smart phone 10 through the network.
<br/><br/> The touch screen 22 may display various pages (pages such as information browsing or functional operations), a processor (not shown) of the smart phone 10 transfers information on a page to be displayed to the touch screen 22, and the touch
screen 22 displays the page.  A user may perform operations of inputting information or sliding a page and the like on the touch screen 22, and the touch screen 22 transfers input information or an operation signal to the processor.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 2A, FIG. 2B, and FIG. 2C, FIG. 2A is a schematic diagram of sensing a magnetic-axis azimuth angle of a smart phone according to the present invention, FIG. 2B is a schematic diagram of sensing a pitch angle of a smart phone
according to the present invention, and FIG. 2C is a schematic diagram of sensing a left-right roll angle of a smart phone according to the present invention.  When a user is operating the smart phone 10, in one operation action of the user, the
orientation sensor 12 senses numerical values such as a magnetic-axis azimuth angle, a pitch angle, a left-right roll angle, and a timestamp of the smart phone 10.  The orientation sensor 12 transfers the numerical values sensed to the behavioral
biometrics conversion element 18.  Each set of numerical values, for example, a set of a magnetic-axis azimuth angle, a pitch angle, a left-right roll angle of the smart phone 10 corresponds to a timestamp, and the timestamp is the system time of the
smart phone 10.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B are schematic diagrams of sliding trajectories on a touch screen according to the present invention.  When a user performs an operation by sliding on the touch screen 22 (as shown in FIG. 1), the touch screen sensor 14 senses
numerical values such as several screen touch positions (X-axis positions and of Y-axis positions), several screen touch areas (sizes of areas), several force values (magnitudes of pressures), and timestamps, as shown in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B.  The touch
screen sensor 14 transfers the sensed numerical values to the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18.  Each set of a screen touch position, a screen touch area, and a force value corresponds to a timestamp, and the timestamp is the system time of
the smart phone 10.
<br/><br/> In this embodiment, the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 performs calculation on the numerical values such as a magnetic-axis azimuth angle, a pitch angle, a left-right roll angle, and a timestamp sensed by the orientation sensor 12
to convert the numerical values into 33 behavioral biometrics quantities of the user.  The touch screen sensor 14 senses numerical values such as several screen touch positions, screen touch areas, force values, and timestamps, and the behavioral
biometrics conversion element 18 performs calculation to convert the numerical values into 16 behavioral biometrics quantities of the user.  However, the number of the behavioral biometrics quantities converted in this embodiment is not used to limit the
present invention, and the number of the behavioral biometrics quantities may be determined according to a design of an application.
<br/><br/> Holding behavioral biometrics, sensed by the orientation sensor 12, of the user, is a range of a variation of an absolute angle or a relative angle, a range of a variation of an average value, and a range of a variation of a standard deviation,
that are separately based on a variation of an angle, a variation of an angular velocity, and a variation of an angular acceleration and are obtained by the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 through calculation on numerical values of three axes
(that is, a magnetic-axis azimuth angle, a pitch angle, and a left-right roll angle) of the smart phone 10, and biometric quantization and conversion of a histogram are performed on the behavioral biometrics quantities, obtained through the calculation,
of the user.  After the conversion, the number of the behavioral biometrics quantities, of the numerical values of the three axes of the smart phone 10, sensed by the orientation sensor 12, is 33.

<br/><br/> When a user operates the smart phone 10, the touch screen sensor 14 can sense a position touched by the user on a two-dimensional plane of the touch screen 22, and an area and the magnitude of a force (a pressure) of the touch on the touch
screen 22.  Therefore, the behavioral biometrics of the operation by the user on the smart phone 10 may be classified into three types according to features: a touch trajectory, an action (velocity and acceleration) of a touch trajectory, and a specific
characteristic (a touch area and a pressure) of the touch on the touch screen 22, and altogether there are 16 behavioral biometrics quantities calculated and converted by the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 based on the numerical values
sensed by the touch screen sensor 14.
<br/><br/> Definitions and calculation formulas of the behavioral biometrics based on the numerical values such as several screen touch positions, screen touch areas, force values, and timestamps sensed by the touch screen sensor 14 are as follows:
<br/><br/> 1.  a start position X.sub.start of an X-axis absolute coordinate of an operating trajectory of the smart phone 10,

<br/><br/> 9.  a path length Path of an operating trajectory of the smart phone 10, using a sample as a reference,
<br/><br/> a path distance between a start coordinate (X.sub.start, Y.sub.start) and an end coordinate (X.sub.end, Y.sub.end): Path=.SIGMA..sub.k=1.sup.n {square root over ((X.sub.k-X.sub.k-1).sup.2+(Y.sub.k-Y.sub.k-1).sup.2)}{square root over
((X.sub.k-X.sub.k-1).sup.2+(Y.sub.k-Y.sub.k-1).sup.2)},
<br/><br/> 10.  a tangential angle .theta..sub.k of an operating trajectory of the smart phone 10, using a sample as a reference,
<br/><br/> a vertical distance D.sub.v.sub._.sub.k=Y.sub.k-Y.sub.k-1;
<br/><br/> a horizontal distance D.sub.h.sub._.sub.k=X.sub.k-X.sub.k-1; and .theta..sub.k=tan.sup.-1(D.sub.v.sub._.sub.k/D.sub.h.sub._.sub.k),
<br/><br/> 11.  a curvature Ck of an operating trajectory of the smart phone 10, using a sample as a reference,

<br/><br/> 12.  a timestamp t (ms) of an operating trajectory of the smart phone 10 is a period of time of each slide on the touch screen 22,
<br/><br/> 13.  a variation v.sub.k of a velocity of an operating trajectory of a smart phone 10, using a sample as a reference, v.sub.k=Path.sub.k/t.sub.k,
<br/><br/> 14.  a variation a.sub.k of an acceleration of an operating trajectory of the smart phone 10, using a sample as a reference,
<br/><br/> ##EQU00007##
<br/><br/> 15.  a variation of a screen touch area of a screen operating trajectory of the smart phone 10, a standardized setting value (0-1) when a smart phone is delivered from a factory is directly used, and
<br/><br/> 16.  a variation of a force value (the magnitude of a pressure) on the screen operating trajectory of the smart phone 10, a standardized setting value (0-1) when a smart phone is delivered from a factory is directly used.
<br/><br/> When a user slides once on the touch screen 22, the smart phone 10 generates a set of numerical values such as several magnetic-axis azimuth angles, pitch angles, left-right roll angles, and timestamps sensed by the orientation sensor 12 as well
as several screen touch positions, screen touch areas, force values, and timestamps sensed by the touch screen sensor 14.  After the orientation sensor 12 and the touch screen sensor 14 transfer a set of the numerical values to the behavioral biometrics
conversion element 18, the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 performs calculation on the set of numerical values and converts the set of values into a set of 33 behavioral biometrics quantities of the holding behavioral biometrics and 16
behavioral biometrics quantities of the operating behavioral biometrics.  The user slides on the touch screen multiple times and the foregoing sensing, calculation, and conversion are performed, so that the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18
generates multiple sets of the foregoing 33 behavioral biometrics quantities of the holding behavioral biometrics and 16 behavioral biometrics quantities of the operating behavioral biometrics.
<br/><br/> After generating multiple sets of the 33 behavioral biometrics quantities of the holding behavioral biometrics and 16 behavioral biometrics quantities of the operating behavioral biometrics, the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18
statistically constructs the multiple sets of the 33 behavioral biometrics quantities of the holding behavioral biometrics and 16 behavioral biometrics quantities of the operating behavioral biometrics into several behavioral biometrics patterns in a
histogram constructing manner.  A histogram of relationships between positions and occurrence proportions of operating trajectories in the present invention in FIG. 4 is used as an example.  For a user 1, a high occurrence proportion of positions of an
operating trajectory in the 33 behavioral biometrics quantities is mainly between 170 and 220; for a user 2, a high occurrence proportion of positions of an operating trajectory in the 33 behavioral biometrics quantities of a user 2 is mainly between 90
and 180, so that it can be found that different users have different habits in operating the smart phone 10.
<br/><br/> The behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 intends to establish a behavioral biometrics model pattern (similar to the pattern on the histogram in FIG. 4) corresponding to a user of the smart phone 10, so that more sets of 33 behavioral
biometrics quantities of the holding behavioral biometrics and 16 behavioral biometrics quantities of the operating behavioral biometrics are needed to statistically construct several behavioral biometrics model patterns on a histogram.  If a behavioral
biometrics model pattern is established from more sets of 33 behavioral biometrics quantities of the holding behavioral biometrics and 16 behavioral biometrics quantities of the operating behavioral biometrics, a result generated by the authentication
mechanism core element 20 through classification and determination performed on the behavioral biometrics model pattern and the behavioral biometrics pattern is more accurate.
<br/><br/> The authentication mechanism core element 20 uses a classifier algorithm to perform classification and determination on the behavioral biometrics model pattern and the behavioral biometrics pattern.  If the behavioral biometrics model pattern
conforms to the behavioral biometrics pattern, the result of the determination is true, which represents that an operation and action behavior of a user on the smart phone 10 conforms to a behavioral biometrics model established in advance, that is, the
user who operates the smart phone 10 is the holder of the smart phone 10; otherwise, the result of the classification and determination is false.
<br/><br/> The authentication mechanism core element 20 may perform the construction by using an existing common classifier algorithm, which is not specifically limited, for example, a weighted k-nearest-neighbor (W-KNN) algorithm, a support vector machine
(SVM) algorithm, an artificial neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron, MLP) algorithm, a Bayes algorithm, a decision tree algorithm, among other algorithms.
<br/><br/> The authentication mechanism core element 20 is trained by using the behavioral biometrics model pattern, of a corresponding holder of the smart phone 10, established by the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18.  To improve the accuracy
of classification and determination of the behavioral biometrics model pattern and the behavioral biometrics pattern, behavioral biometrics model patterns of one or more persons other than the holder of the smart phone 10 may be added to the
authentication mechanism core element 20 to be tested, so that the accuracy of the classification and determination of the behavioral biometrics model pattern and the behavioral biometrics pattern by the authentication mechanism core element 20 can be
improved.  The behavioral biometrics model patterns of persons other than the holder of the smart phone 10 may be provided by a system supplier or a programmer.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a flowchart of operations for authenticating a user of a smart phone according to the present invention.  During the description of procedures and steps in FIG. 5, reference may be made to FIG. 1 to FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> A smart phone 10 includes an orientation sensor 12, a touch screen sensor 14, and a touch screen 22, and an authentication module 16 includes a behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 and an authentication mechanism core element 20.  The
authentication module 16 may be built in an operating system or an application (app) of the smart phone 10.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the authentication module 16 may be built in a server (not shown).  When the authentication module 16 is built in a server, several magnetic-axis azimuth angles, pitch angles, left-right roll angles, and timestamps sensed
by the orientation sensor 12 and several screen touch positions, screen touch areas, force values, and timestamps sensed by the touch screen sensor 14 are transferred to the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 through a network, and a result of
classification and determination by the authentication mechanism core element 20 is transferred to the smart phone 10 through the network.
<br/><br/> The smart phone 10 is used to sense behavioral biometrics of a user, so as to monitor a behavior of a user in real time.  The behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 and the authentication mechanism core element 20 are implemented on a
remote server, and provide operation service through the efficacy of remote server hardware.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment of FIG. 5, a case where an operation mechanism and a module for authenticating a user of a smart phone are embedded in an app of <b><i>Facebook</i></b> is used as an example, and a user of the smart phone 10 taps and selects a pattern of
<b><i>Facebook</i></b> on an application page on the touch screen 22.  When the user taps and selects the pattern of <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> the smart phone 10 starts the operation mechanism and the module for authenticating a user of a smart phone (Step S60).
<br/><br/> When a user slides once on the touch screen 22, the smart phone 10 generates a set of numerical values such as several magnetic-axis azimuth angles, pitch angles, left-right roll angles, and timestamps sensed by the orientation sensor 12 and
several screen touch positions, screen touch areas, force values, and timestamps sensed by the touch screen sensor 14 (Step S62).
<br/><br/> After the orientation sensor 12 and the touch screen sensor 14 transfer a set of the numerical values to the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18, the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 performs the foregoing calculation on a set
of numerical values of three axes (that is, a magnetic-axis azimuth angle, a pitch angle, and a left-right roll angle) of the smart phone 10 to obtain 33 behavioral biometrics quantities, of a range of a variation of an absolute angle or a relative
angle, a range of a variation of an average value, and a range of a variation of a standard deviation, that are separately based on a variation of an angle, a variation of an angular velocity, and a variation of an angular acceleration.  The behavioral
biometrics conversion element 18 performs the foregoing calculation on a set of numerical values such as a touch trajectory, an action (velocity and acceleration) of the touch trajectory, and specific characteristics (a touch area and a pressure) of the
touch on the touch screen 22 to obtain 16 behavioral biometrics quantities (Step S64).
<br/><br/> When the user slides on the touch screen multiple times, multiple sets of numerical values such as several magnetic-axis azimuth angles, pitch angles, left-right roll angles, and timestamps sensed by the orientation sensor 12 and several screen
touch positions, screen touch areas, force values, and timestamps sensed by the touch screen sensor 14 are transferred to the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18.  The behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 performs the foregoing calculation
to obtain multiple sets of 33 behavioral biometrics quantities of the holding behavioral biometrics and 16 behavioral biometrics quantities of the operating behavioral biometrics.  The behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 performs biometric
quantization and conversion of a histogram on the multiple sets of behavioral biometrics quantities, that is, statistically establishes a behavioral biometrics pattern corresponding to each behavioral biometrics quantity in a histogram.  For example,
FIG. 4 shows a behavioral biometrics pattern of positions of operating trajectories in behavioral biometrics quantities in a histogram (Step S66).
<br/><br/> The behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 transfers the multiple sets of behavioral biometrics patterns corresponding to each behavioral biometrics quantity to the authentication mechanism core element 20.  The authentication mechanism
core element 20 uses the foregoing classifier algorithm to perform classification and determination on the behavioral biometrics pattern according to a behavioral biometrics model pattern on a histogram, so as to determine whether the user of the smart
phone 10 is the holder of the smart phone 10 (Step S68).
<br/><br/> The establishment of a behavioral biometrics model pattern (similar to the pattern on the histogram in FIG. 4) of a corresponding holder of the smart phone 10 is to statistically construct several behavioral biometrics model patterns
corresponding to each behavioral biometrics quantity on a histogram by using more sets of 33 behavioral biometrics quantities of the holding behavioral biometrics and 16 behavioral biometrics quantities of the operating behavioral biometrics.  If a
behavioral biometrics model pattern is established from more sets of 33 behavioral biometrics quantities of the holding behavioral biometrics and 16 behavioral biometrics quantities of the operating behavioral biometrics, a result generated by the
authentication mechanism core element 20 through classification and determination performed on the behavioral biometrics model pattern and the behavioral biometrics pattern is more accurate.
<br/><br/> If the result of the classification and determination performed by the authentication mechanism core element 20 on the behavioral biometrics model pattern and the behavioral biometrics pattern is false, that is, the behavioral biometrics model
pattern does not conform to the behavioral biometrics pattern, which represents that the user who operates the smart phone 10 is not the holder of the smart phone 10, the authentication mechanism core element 20 sends an error signal to the smart phone
10, so that the smart phone 10 displays an error message on the touch screen 22 or displays a home page to stop the user from operating programs such as the <b><i>Facebook</i></b> app (Step S70).  If the result of the classification and determination performed by the
authentication mechanism core element 20 on the behavioral biometrics model pattern and the behavioral biometrics pattern is true, that is, the behavioral biometrics model pattern conforms to the behavioral biometrics pattern, which represents that the
user who operates the smart phone 10 is the holder of the smart phone 10, the authentication mechanism core element 20 sends a correct signal to the smart phone 10, so that the user may keep operating the <b><i>Facebook</i></b> app (Step S72).
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, when the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18 and the authentication mechanism core element 20 are built in the server (not shown), in Step S64, the orientation sensor 12 and the touch screen sensor 14 transfer the
foregoing sensed numerical values through the network to the behavioral biometrics conversion element 18, in Step S70 and Step S72, the authentication mechanism core element 20 sends an error signal or a correct signal to the smart phone 10, and
procedures and steps that are not elaborated are the same as the procedures and steps in the foregoing embodiment, description of which is omitted herein.
<br/><br/> The foregoing method for authenticating a user of a smart phone in the present invention may be implemented by a computer program product, and after a smart phone downloads the computer program product from, for example, the network and executes
the computer program product, steps of the method in the foregoing description and drawings may be implemented.
<br/><br/> The present invention provides a method, a module, and a computer program product for authenticating a user of a mobile device.  An orientation sensor and a touch screen sensor that are built in a smart phone are used to collect, when a user
operates the smart phone, behavioral biometrics about holding of and operations on the smart phone of the user to perform authentication, so as to form a new generation protection mechanism for a smart phone and provide stronger protection for a smart
phone.
<br/><br/> Although the present invention is described above with reference to preferred embodiments and exemplary drawings, the present invention should not be limited thereto.  Various modifications, omissions, and variations made by a person skilled in
the art do not depart from the scope of the present invention.
