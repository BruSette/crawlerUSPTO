       <p> In one embodiment, a geo-social networking system determines a user's
     current location, calculates a novelty score for the location
     representing the user's degree of familiarity, and surfaces content
     within a geographic and temporal radius based on the novelty score for
     display to the user.

<br/><br/> This application is a continuation under 35 U.S.C. .sctn.120 of U.S.
     patent application Ser. No. 13/275,060, filed 17 Oct. 2011, which is
     incorporated herein by reference.
         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method comprising, by one or more processors of a social-networking system: accessing, by one or more of the processors, social-networking information of a user from a
data store of the social-networking system;  receiving, from a client system of the user, a location associated with the user;  and calculating, by one or more of the processors, a novelty score of the location for the user, wherein the novelty score is
inversely related to an estimate of a familiarity of the user with the location, the estimated familiarity being based on the accessed social-networking information of the user.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, further comprising, by one or more computing devices, surfacing one or more pieces of content to the user based at least in part on the novelty score.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 2, further comprising, by one or more computing devices, ranking the pieces of content based at least in part on one or more of: one or more distances between the location and one or more locations associated with one or
more of the pieces of content;  one or more engagement levels associated with one or more of the pieces of content;  or one or more social coefficients between the user and one or more other users of the social-networking system associated with one or
more of the pieces of content.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 2, wherein surfacing the pieces of content to the user comprises delivering the pieces of content in the form of: one or more news feeds;  one or more photo slideshows configured to replace one or more default screens of
a mobile computing device of the user;  or one or more maps comprising one or more pins designating one or more locations associated with one or more of the pieces of content.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 1, wherein the location associated with the user is a current location of the user.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 1, wherein the location associated with the user is a predicted future location of the user.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 1, wherein the location is determined based at least in part on one or more of: one or more events associated with the user;  one or more photographs uploaded to the social-networking system by the user;  one or more
photographs uploaded to the social-networking system that are associated with one or more tags associated with the user;  or Global Positioning System (GPS) data from a mobile computing device of the user.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 1, wherein the social-networking information of the user comprises information associated with one or more of: demographics;  communication channels;  personal interests;  social-graphs;  locations;  photographs;  videos; stories;  reviews;  news entries;  links;  events;  audio;  deals;  promotions;  ads;  activities;  calendars;  events;  privacy settings;  check-ins;  Global Positioning System (GPS) data;  tags;  comments;  time stamps;  time data;  or data associated
with social-networking services.
<br/><br/> 9.  The method of claim 1, wherein the estimate of the familiarity of the user with the location is based at least in part on one or more of: a distance between the location and a location previously associated with the user;  an amount of time
the user has previously spent at the location;  or the social-networking information.
<br/><br/> 10.  The method of claim 2, wherein calculating a novelty score of the location for the user comprises determining one or more of: a geographic area associated with the location;  or a temporal radius associated with the location;  and wherein
surfacing one or more pieces of content to the user comprises retrieving one or more of the pieces of information based at least in part on one or more of the geographic area or the temporal radius.
<br/><br/> 11.  One or more computer-readable non-transitory storage media embodying software that is operable when executed to: access, by one or more processors of a social-networking system, social-networking information of a user from a data store of
the social-networking system;  receive, from a client system of the user, a location associated with the user;  and calculate, by one or more of the processors, a novelty score of the location for the user, wherein the novelty score is inversely related
to an estimate of a familiarity of the user with the location, the estimated familiarity being based on the accessed social-networking information of the user.

<br/><br/> The present disclosure relates generally to a geo-social networking service and, more particularly, to surfacing content to a device based on geo-social factors.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system.  The social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a user profile, in
connection with the user.  The user profile may include a user's demographic information, communication channel information, and personal interest.  The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user's relationship with other users
in the social networking system (e.g., social graph), as well as provide services (e.g., wall-posts, photo-sharing, or instant messaging) to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system.  A geo-social networking system is a
social networking system in which geographic services and capabilities are used to enable additional social interactions.  User-submitted location data or geo-location techniques (e.g., mobile phone position tracking) can allow a geo-social network to
connect and coordinate users with local people or events that match their interests.  For example, users can check-in to a place using a mobile client application by providing a name of a place (or selecting a place from a pre-established list of
places).  The geo-social networking system, among other things, can record information about the user's presence at the place and possibly provide this information to other users of the geo-social networking system.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments relate to a geo-social networking system that includes features directed to automatically surfacing content related to the current location of a client device based on various geo-social factors.  These and other features,
aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The invention is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.  In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding
of the present disclosure.  It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details.  In other instances, well known process steps and/or structures have not been
described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure.  In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the
disclosure to the described embodiments.  To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.
<br/><br/> A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it, and with each other through, the system.  Typically, to become a registered user of a social networking system, an entity, either human or
non-human, registers for an account with the social networking system.  Thereafter, the registered user may log into the social networking system via an account by providing, for example, a correct login ID or username and password.  As used herein, a
"user" may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.
<br/><br/> When a user registers for an account with a social networking system, the social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a "user profile", in connection with the user.  The user profile may include information
provided by the user and information gathered by various systems, including the social networking system, relating to activities or actions of the user.  For example, the user may provide his name, profile picture, contact information, birth date,
gender, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, and other demographical information to be included in his user profile.  The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user
considers to be his friends.  A list of the user's friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user's profile.  Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction.  For example, if Bob and Joe
are both users and connect with each another, Bob and Joe are each connections of the other.  If, on the other hand, Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam's posted content items, but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob, a one-way connection may be
formed where Sam is Bob's connection, but Bob is not Sam's connection.  Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections (e.g., friends of friends).  Connections may be added
explicitly by a user, for example, the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend, or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users (e.g., users who are alumni of the same educational
institution).  The user may identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user's profile.
<br/><br/> The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user (such as contact information and interests) at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time.  The user may also update his or her profile information at
any time.  For example, when the user moves, or changes a phone number, he may update his contact information.  Additionally, the user's interests may change as time passes, and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time.  A
user's activities on the social networking system, such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system, may also provide information that may be included in the user's profile.  Again, such information may be updated from time to time to
reflect the user's most-recent activities.  Still further, other users or so-called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user's profile.  For example, a contact may add the user as a friend (or
remove the user as a friend).  A contact may also write messages to the user's profile pages--typically known as wall-posts.  A user may also input status messages that get posted to the user's profile page.
<br/><br/> A social network system may maintain social graph information, which can generally model the relationships among groups of individuals, and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds.  A social network
may be represented using a graph structure.  Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network.  Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users.  In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is
defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other.  A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.
<br/><br/> A social networking system may support a variety of applications, such as photo sharing, on-line calendars and events.  For example, the social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities.  For example, the social networking
system may allow users to post photographs and other multimedia files to a user's profile, such as in a wall post or in a photo album, both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system.  Social networking system may also
allow users to configure events.  For example, a first user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event, location of the event and other users invited to the event.  The invited users may receive invitations to the event
and respond (such as by accepting the invitation or declining it).  Furthermore, social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar.  Similarly to events, the calendar entries may include times, dates, locations and identities of
other users.
<br/><br/> The social networking system may also support a privacy model.  A user may or may not wish to share his information with other users or third-party applications, or a user may wish to share his information only with specific users or third-party
applications.  A user may control whether his information is shared with other users or third-party applications through privacy settings associated with his user profile.  For example, a user may select a privacy setting for each user datum associated
with the user and/or select settings that apply globally or to categories or types of user profile information.  A privacy setting defines, or identifies, the set of entities (e.g., other users, connections of the user, friends of friends, or third party
application) that may have access to the user datum.  The privacy setting may be specified on various levels of granularity, such as by specifying particular entities in the social network (e.g., other users), predefined groups of the user's connections,
a particular type of connections, all of the user's connections, all first-degree connections of the user's connections, the entire social network, or even the entire Internet (e.g., to make the posted content item index-able and searchable on the
Internet).  A user may choose a default privacy setting for all user data that is to be posted.  Additionally, a user may specifically exclude certain entities from viewing a user datum or a particular type of user data.
<br/><br/> Social networking system may maintain a database of information relating to geographic locations or places.  Places may correspond to various physical locations, such as restaurants, bars, train stations, airports and the like.  Some places may
correspond to larger regions that themselves contain places--such as a restaurant or a gate location in an airport.  In one implementation, each place can be maintained as a hub node in a social graph or other data structure maintained by the social
networking system, as described in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 12/863,181, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.  Social networking system may allow users to access information regarding each place using a client application
(e.g., a browser) hosted by a wired or wireless station, such as a laptop, desktop or mobile device.  For example, social networking system may serve web pages (or other structured documents) to users that request information about a place.  In addition
to user profile and place information, the social networking system may track or maintain other information about the user.  For example, the social networking system may support geo-social networking system functionality including one or more
location-based services that record the user's location.  For example, users may access the geo-social networking system using a special-purpose client application hosted by a mobile device of the user (or a web- or network-based application using a
browser client).  The client application may automatically access Global Positioning System (GPS) or other geo-location functions supported by the mobile device and report the user's current location to the geo-social networking system.  In addition, the
client application may support geo-social networking functionality that allows users to check-in at various locations and communicate this location to other users.  A check-in to a given place may occur when a user is physically located at a place and,
using a mobile device, access the geo-social networking system to register the user's presence at the place.  A user may select a place from a list of existing places near to the user's current location or create a new place.  The user may also provide
comments in a text string when checking in to a given place.  The user may also identify one or more other users in connection with a check-in (such as friends of a user) and associate them with the check-in as well.  U.S.  patent application Ser.  No.
12/584,614, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes, describes a system that allows a first user to check-in other users at a given place.  An entry including a comment and a time stamp corresponding to the time the user checked in may
be displayed to other users.  For example, a record of the user's check-in activity may be stored in a database.  Social networking system may select one or more records associated with check-in activities of users at a given place and include such
check-in activity in web pages (or other structured documents) that correspond to a given place.  For example, social networking system may select the check-in activity associated with the friends or other social contacts of a user that requests a page
corresponding to a place.  U.S.  application Ser.  No. 12/858,817, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes, describes an example geo-social networking system that can be used in connection with various embodiments of the present
invention.  The check-in activity may also be displayed on a user profile page and in news feeds provided to users of the social networking system.
<br/><br/> Still further, a special purpose client application hosted on a mobile device of a user may be configured to continuously capture location data of the mobile device and send the location data to social networking system.  In this manner, the
social networking system may track the user's location and provide various recommendations to the user related to places that are proximal to the user's path or that are frequented by the user.  In one implementation, a user may opt in to this
recommendation service, which causes the client application to periodically post location data of the user to the social networking system.
<br/><br/> Still further, particular embodiments allow the social networking system to surface various pieces of content based on the current location of a device associated with a particular user or member of the social network, aggregate amount of time
spent by the user in the current location, and the distance between the previously determined location and the current location of the device.  Based on these factors, the social networking system may determine the "novelty" of the current location to
the user of the client device, and cast a wider or narrower net geographically and temporally for surfaced content.  For example, if a user is in a location where he or she has spent little to no time, the social networking system may surface content
from the entire region, state, or country of the location.  Furthermore, if the user has spent little or no time in a particular location, content may be surfaced from any date in the past.  However, if the user has spent a significant amount of time in
a particular location, the social networking system determines that the location is not novel to the user, and surfaces content only related to a small geographic radius, and posted to the social network in the last few days.
<br/><br/> Content may be anything existing on the social network related to the location, including without limitation: photos, videos, stories, check-ins, comments, reviews, news entries, links, events, audio, deals, promotions, ads, and the like.  In
particular embodiments, the content replaces the home screen, background screen, lock screen, or other default screens of the user's mobile device.  In particular embodiments, the content is generated as a custom news feed for the location.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, content matching the search radius is ranked based on social relevancy, and displayed to the user in order of descending social relevancy.  Multiple factors may be taken into account when determining social relevancy,
including without limitation: the relationship between the user and the user who generated the content, the amount of engagement of the content, and whether the content was uploaded by a friend of another user of the social network who is in the same
location as the user.
<br/><br/> Thus this disclosure provides users of client devices a manner of physically exploring the social graph by surfacing relevant content based on geo-social factors.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example social networking system.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store user profile data and social graph information in user profile database 101.  In particular embodiments, the social
networking system may store user event data in event database 102.  For example, a user may register a new event by accessing a client application to define an event name, a time and a location, and cause the newly created event to be stored in event
database 102.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store user privacy policy data in privacy policy database 103.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store geographic and location data in location database
104.  In particular embodiments, databases 101, 102, 103, and 104 may be operably connected to the social networking system's front end.  In particular embodiments, the front end 120 may interact with client device 122 through network cloud 121.  Client
device 122 is generally a computer or computing device including functionality for communicating (e.g., remotely) over a computer network.  Client device 122 may be a desktop computer, laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), in- or out-of-car
navigation system, smart phone or other cellular or mobile phone, or mobile gaming device, among other suitable computing devices.  Client device 122 may execute one or more client applications, such as a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Windows Internet
Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera, etc.) or special-purpose client application (e.g., <b><i>Facebook</i></b> for iPhone, etc.), to access and view content over a computer network.  Front end 120 may include web or HTTP server
functionality, as well as other functionality, to allow users to access the social networking system.  Network cloud 121 generally represents a network or collection of networks (such as the Internet or a corporate intranet, or a combination of both)
over which client devices 122 may access the social network system.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store an information base of places, where each place includes a name, a geographic location and meta information (such as the user that initially created the place, reviews, comments,
check-in activity data, and the like).  Places may be created by administrators of the system and/or created by users of the system.  For example, a user may register a new place by accessing a client application to define a place name and provide a
geographic location and cause the newly created place to be registered in location database 104.  As discussed above, a created place may correspond to a hub node, which an administrator can claim for purposes of augmenting the information about the
place and for creating ads or other offers to be delivered to users.  In particular embodiments, system front end 120 may construct and serve a web page of a place, as requested by a user.  In some embodiments, a web page of a place may include
selectable components for a user to "like" the place or check in to the place.  In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store geo-location data identifying a real-world geographic location of a user associated with a check-in. For example, a
geographic location of an Internet connected computer can be identified by the computer's IP address.  For example, a geographic location of a cell phone equipped with cellular, Wi-Fi and/or GPS capabilities can be identified by cell tower triangulation,
Wi-Fi positioning, and/or GPS positioning.  In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store a geographic location and additional information of a plurality of places.  For example, a place can be a local business, a point of interest (e.g.,
Union Square in San Francisco, Calif.), a college, a city, or a national park.  For example, a geographic location of a place (e.g., a local coffee shop) can be an address, a set of geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), or a reference to
another place (e.g., "the coffee shop next to the train station").  For example, a geographic location of a place with a large area (e.g., Yosemite National Park) can be a shape (e.g., a circle, or a polygon) approximating the boundary of the place
and/or a centroid of the shape.  For example, additional information of a place can be business hours, photos, or user reviews of the place.  In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store a user's location data.  For example, a user can
create a place (e.g., a new restaurant or coffee shop) and the social networking system can store the created place in location database 104.  For example, location database 104 may store a user's check-in activities.  For example, location database 104
may store a user's geographic location provided by the user's GPS-equipped mobile device.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may calculate one or more routes of a user based on the user's user profile information, check-in
activities, and/or geographic location data reported by a client application (see above) and store the one or more routes in location database 104.  For example, the social networking system can calculate a "commute route" of a user between the user's
home and work (as described in the user's user profile information stored in user profile database 101) by using a mapping service application such as Google Maps, or by using geographic location data points from the user's GPS-equipped mobile phone
while the user is driving to work.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an example method of surfacing content based on geo-social factors in accordance with one embodiments of the invention.  FIG. 2 can be implemented by a content surfacing process hosted by one or more computing devices of the
social networking system.  In particular embodiments, the content surfacing process first determines a user's client device 122's current location (201).  For example, the content surfacing process can determine a user's current location based on a
geographic location reported by the user's GPS-equipped mobile phone.  For example, the content surfacing process can determine a user's current location by accessing event database 102 and determine a current event (e.g., a meeting, a lunch appointment)
that the user attends and a location associated with the current event.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may ascertain the location of client device 122 through matching an uploaded photo with a database of known photos via an
image object recognition computer vision algorithm.  In particular embodiments, the content surfacing process determines the location of client device 122 through assisted GPS or time distance of arrival (TDOA) triangulation.  This disclosure
contemplates any suitable manner of obtaining the location of client device 122.
<br/><br/> At Step 202 the content surfacing process determines a "novelty" score for the location unique to client device 122.  The novelty score is an estimation as to how familiar the user of a mobile or client device is with the location.  In
particular embodiments, the novelty score may be based off a number of geo-social factors.  For example, the social networking system may continuously collect location data from a particular user's client device 122 to ascertain the aggregate amount of
time a user has spent in a particular location.  When the user has spent little or no time in a given location, the social networking system may, in particular embodiments, estimate that the user does not know the area at all, and assign a high novelty
score to the location for client device 122.  In particular embodiments, a single user may be associated with multiple client devices.  For example, a user may log in from a desktop or notebook computer.  In such a case, the IP address may be mapped to a
physical location, and the social network may assume the user is in that location.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may parse the user's profile information for self-declared location information, including but not limited to: the
user's current city, the user's hometown, the user's cities of education, and the user's cities of employment.  Generally speaking the novelty score decreases as the user spends more time in a given location.
<br/><br/> On the other hand, if the social networking system has found that the user has spent several years in the same location, the social networking system may estimate that the user lives in the area and knows it well; consequently the social
networking system may assign a low novelty score to the location for client device 122.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system takes into account, in addition to the aggregate amount of time spent in the location, the last time the user
was detected in the location.  For example, if a user is visiting an area that he or she has spent a great deal of time in, but has not visited recently, the social networking system may increase the novelty score accordingly.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the novelty score is based on the distance (".DELTA.d") between the most recent previously-determined position of client device 122 and the current location of client device 122.  For example, where a user travels from
San Francisco, Calif., to Barcelona, Spain, upon powering up his or her device in Spain, the social networking system determines that .DELTA.d is 5,962 miles, and will accordingly increase the novelty score for the current location.  In particular
embodiments, other geo-social factors may be accounted for in the novelty score.  In particular embodiments, information may be mined from the user's personal profile to calculate the novelty score.  If, for example, a user's employment history states
that he was employed in the current location, the social networking system may utilize this information, as well as the length of employment, to adjust the novelty score for the location.  In particular embodiments, if the user has been tagged in a photo
in the location, the social networking system accordingly reduces the novelty score for the location.  In particular embodiments, if the user has granted the social network to other social networks services, e-mail services, or other cloud-based
computing services, the social networking system may mine the user's data to ascertain whether the user has previously visited the current location.  In particular embodiments, the aggregate time spent is weighted heavier than the .DELTA.d value in
calculating the novelty score.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of calculating a novelty score, and utilizing any combination of social factors or weighting in the novelty score calculation.
<br/><br/> The novelty score calculated in Step 202 is utilized to determine what content to surface to the user.  In particular embodiments, content existing on the social network one or both location and time uploads.  For example, uploaded photographs
may be associated with a physical location on the social network.  In particular embodiments, photographs are associated with a physical location based on EXIF location data.  In particular embodiments, uploaded photographs are associated with a
particular physical location through matching the photos with a database of photos having a known geographic location via a computer vision algorithm.  Similarly, uploaded photos may include EXIF data including the date and time of capture. 
Alternatively, the social networking system may timestamp the uploaded photograph with the date and time of upload.
<br/><br/> Because it is desirable for the content surfacing process to deliver content to the user that is relevant to the user, in particular embodiments, the granularity of the delivered content is inversely correlated with the novelty score for the
location.  In particular embodiments, the granularity of delivered content is defined by a geographic radius from the location and a temporal duration from the current time.  For example, where a user is completely unfamiliar with an area (high novelty
score), the content surfacing process will pull content from a large geographic radius, such as the entire region, state, or country containing the location.  Similarly, where a user is unfamiliar with an area, the content surfacing system will pull
content from a large temporal duration, for example, all content, regardless of the timestamp.  On the other hand, if a user is in an area he or she knows well (low novelty score), the content surfacing process may only deliver content within a small
geographic area (such as within 100 feet) and occurring within a short temporal duration (for example, within the last 24 hours).  Thus the content surfacing process delivers relevant content to the user that is tailored to his estimated familiarity of
his or her present location.  In particular embodiments, the granularity is inversely correlated with the novelty score.  In particular embodiments, the granularity is nonlinearly inversely correlated with the novelty score.  In particular embodiments,
the granularity is weighted unevenly between the multiple factors.  In particular embodiments, the content surfacing system is not limited to filtering content by geographic radius and temporal duration.  In particular embodiments, a particular city or
region may be segmented into any arbitrary region, such as a neighborhood or district.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of filtering the content to be surfaced.
<br/><br/> At Step 203, the content surfacing process retrieves content that falls within the geographic and temporal radius determined based on the novelty score calculated in Step 202.  As previously disclosed, the geographic radius need not be limited
to a circular radius.  In particular embodiments, any arbitrary geographic area may be utilized to filter surfaced content.  As previously stated, "content" comprises any type of information stored on the social networking system.  For example, photos
that were captured within the geographic area and uploaded by friends of the user, check-ins by friends of the user to locations falling within with the geographic area, reviews of businesses or entities in the geographic area by friends of the user,
comments on pages associated with locations falling within the geographic area by the friends of the users, pages associated with locations within the geographic area, and comments including text associated with locations within the geographic area. 
This disclosure contemplates delivering any type of information from the social networking system to the user as surfaced content.
<br/><br/> In Step 204, the list of content to be surfaced is ranked by the content surfacing processing based on distance, relevancy, and other geo-social factors.  For example, the content surfacing process can rank the list of content based on a
distance between location associated with the content and the user's current location by arranging the content closest to the user's current location to the top of the list.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system calculates a social
coefficient representing how close two individual users are on the social network, based on demographic factors, mutual friends, and the degree of interaction between the two users, and pushes content uploaded or associated with users having a higher
social coefficient with the user to the top of the list.  In particular embodiments, highly engaged content, such as photos that have been highly commented on or highly liked, are ranked higher.  In particular embodiments, the content surfacing process
ranks content published by friends of another user in the same location as the user of client device 122 are ranked higher.  For example, if user A and user B are at the same location at the same time, content published by the friends of user B are
surfaced to user A, and vice versa.
<br/><br/> At Step 205 the content surfacing process delivers the content to the client device 122.  In particular embodiments, the delivered content may take the form of a customized "news feed" on the user's client device 122.  In particular embodiments,
the surfaced content may be a photo slideshow that replaces the lock screen, screen saver, desktop background, or any other default screen of client device 122.  In particular embodiments, the surfaced content may be delivered to the user in the form of
a map having "pins" designating the location of each piece of content.  In particular embodiments, these pins may also designate the type of story or content at a given location.  In particular embodiments, content may be delivered to client device 122
through a notifications indicator.  For example, a user may receive a selectable notification, that when selected, displays the delivered content.  In particular embodiments, the notification system operates in real-time; the user receives a notification
as soon as the relevant content is generated on the social networking system.  In particular embodiments, the notifications are based on a specific geographic radius surrounding the location of client device 122.  In particular embodiments, the radius
may be 10 meters, and as a user approaches a geographic location where a particular piece of relevant content was created, the user receives a notification.  For example, as a user is walking past a particular restaurant that is associated with a review
created by one of the user's friends, he or she may receive a notification displaying the review.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of delivering and displaying surfaced content to the user through client device 122.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 depicts an example traveler utilizing the content surfacing process in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.  Assume a hypothetical traveler is based in San Francisco, and therefore, the novelty score for San Francisco for the
hypothetical user is extremely low.  When the user powers up his or her phone upon landing in Barcelona 301, the content surfacing process calculates a relevancy score for Barcelona based on the distance traveled from the user's last location and the
aggregate time spent in Barcelona.  In this example, the novelty score is high, and therefore the granularity is extremely low.  Thus, the temporal and geographical radius 301a from which to pull content is extremely large.  Therefore, the user is
displayed content and points of interest from an area that may cover all of Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and parts of France.  Similarly, because the user is unfamiliar with the area, the content surfacing system may deliver content from any time period,
for example, a photo from a friend who visited Barcelona three years ago.
<br/><br/> However, as the hypothetical travel remains in Barcelona for an extended period of time, the content surfacing process determines that Barcelona is less novel to the user, and increases the granularity of the content to be surfaced to the user. 
As shown in FIG. 4, as the user spends more time within the Las Ramblas district 401 of Barcelona, the geographic and temporal search area 401a for content to be surfaced is dramatically reduced.  As previously discussed, geographic search area 401 may
take any arbitrary shape, such as the neighborhood encompassing Las Ramblas.  If the hypothetical user was to remain in the same area, search area 401 would be reduced in geographic and temporal radius until, in particular embodiments, only content
relating to locations within a few hundred feet and occurring a few days prior is displayed to the user.
<br/><br/> Referring back to FIG. 3, if the hypothetical traveler moves to Madrid 302, geographic and temporal search radius 302b is re-centered around Madrid.  Although the user may have a low aggregate amount of time spent in Madrid, the geographic and
temporal search area is not increased again to the size of 301a, because the distance between Madrid and Barcelona is far smaller than between San Francisco and Barcelona.  Thus, the content surfacing process displays content relating to Madrid, rather
than all of Spain, to the user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 depicts an example relationship between the geographic and temporal search radius versus time for the hypothetical traveler of FIGS. 3 and 4.  Prior to T=1, the user's location indicates he or she is in San Francisco, and because the user
has spent a large amount of aggregate time in San Francisco, the initial geographic and temporal search radius is extremely small.  Thus, while in San Francisco, the content surfacing process delivers extremely granular stories to the user, such as
photos from a party down the street from the previous evening.
<br/><br/> At T=1, the user powers down his or her client device 122 to fly from San Francisco to Barcelona.  Upon powering up client device 122 at T=2, the social networking system calculates a novelty score based upon at least the aggregate amount of
time the user has spent in Barcelona and the difference in position from the previously reported location and the current location.  In this example, because the distance is large and the aggregate amount of time is small, the novelty is high, and
therefore, the search area, both geographically and temporally, is extremely large.  Thus, the content surfacing system shows, in particular embodiments, photos posted by the user's friends at any date from all of Spain.  As the user spends more time in
Barcelona, the geographic and temporal search radius progressively decreases.
<br/><br/> At T=2, the user travels to Madrid, and the content surfacing process calculates a new novelty score for Madrid for the user.  Because the user has not been in Madrid before, but because the delta between his or her last location (Barcelona) and
current location is relatively small, the search radius increases slightly and is re-centered around Madrid.  In particular embodiments, the content surfacing process takes into account the distance traveled over time.  For example, when traveling via
plane, the distance traveled over time is very high, and thus, the user is less likely to be familiar with the area.  However, when traveling by car or train, the distance traveled over time is relatively low, so the user is more likely to be familiar
with the area.  In particular embodiments, the content surfacing process recalculates the novelty score any time the user has moved beyond a given distance.  In particular embodiments, the content surfacing process continuously calculates a novelty score
for the current location of client device 122, and utilizes a sliding window for distance traveled over time to determine whether the user is in transit.  As when the hypothetical traveler was in Barcelona, as the user spends more and more time in
Madrid, the geographic and temporal search radius decreases at a linear or nonlinear rate.
<br/><br/> At T=4, the user arrives back in San Francisco.  In particular embodiments, the search radius returns to the previous level (prior to T=1).  In particular embodiments, as shown in FIG. 5, only the temporal search radius increases.  Thus, the
content surfacing process shows the user the content that was generated since the time that the user left.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 6a, 6b, and 6c depict various interfaces for displaying surfaced content on client device 122.  FIG. 6a depicts an example custom news feed 600.  In particular embodiments, the custom news feed 600 may be accessed by the user via a
specialized tab on a client application that connects to the social networking system.  In particular embodiments, the custom news feed 600 may be accessed by navigating to a particular web page.  Custom news feed 600 includes surfaced content in the
form of news feed entries 601, 602, 603, and 604.  In particular embodiments, the entries may correspond to check in 602, photo story 602, review 603, and video 604, posted by the friends of the user or second degree connections of the user.  In
particular embodiments, the second degree connections are friends with another friend of the user who is traveling with the user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6b depicts an example unlock screen 605 as a method of delivering surfaced content.  In particular embodiments, when client device 122 is locked, the device renders an unlock screen 605 on its touchscreen, including a button 606 that a user
must swipe in a particular direction to unlock the device for use.  In particular embodiments, a slideshow of the most popular photos 608 from that location and uploaded by the user's friends is rendered on the unlock screen.  The photo may also include
the caption 608, the names of the tagged users, and the tagged object, if applicable.  In particular embodiments, the slideshow replaces any number of default screens on client device 122, such as the desktop background.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6c depicts another example method of displaying surfaced stories.  In FIG. 6C, client device 122 displays an interactive map of the area surrounding the user's location 609.  On this map are pins 611-616, each pin corresponding to a story
or piece of content that was generated at the location indicated by the pin.  In particular embodiments, the user may click, tap, or select a pin to view the story in detail.  In particular embodiments, each pin is colored or designed differently to
indicate the type of story (photo, video, review, check-in, etc.).  This disclosure contemplates any manner of displaying surfaced content to a user of client device 122.

<br/><br/> The client-side functionality described above can be implemented as a series of instructions stored on a computer-readable storage medium that, when executed, cause a programmable processor to implement the operations described above.  While the
client device 122 may be implemented in a variety of different hardware and computing systems, FIG. 8 shows a schematic representation of the main components of an example computing platform of a client or mobile device, according to various particular
embodiments.  In particular embodiments, computing platform 802 may comprise controller 804, memory 806, and input output subsystem 810.  In particular embodiments, controller 804 which may comprise one or more processors and/or one or more
microcontrollers configured to execute instructions and to carry out operations associated with a computing platform.  In various embodiments, controller 804 may be implemented as a single-chip, multiple chips and/or other electrical components including
one or more integrated circuits and printed circuit boards.  Controller 804 may optionally contain a cache memory unit for temporary local storage of instructions, data, or computer addresses.  By way of example, using instructions retrieved from memory,
controller 804 may control the reception and manipulation of input and output data between components of computing platform 802.  By way of example, controller 804 may include one or more processors or one or more controllers dedicated for certain
processing tasks of computing platform 802, for example, for 2D/3D graphics processing, image processing, or video processing.
<br/><br/> Controller 804 together with a suitable operating system may operate to execute instructions in the form of computer code and produce and use data.  By way of example and not by way of limitation, the operating system may be Windows-based,
Mac-based, or Unix or Linux-based, or Symbian-based, among other suitable operating systems.  The operating system, other computer code and/or data may be physically stored within memory 806 that is operatively coupled to controller 804.
<br/><br/> Memory 806 may encompass one or more storage media and generally provide a place to store computer code (e.g., software and/or firmware) and data that are used by computing platform 802.  By way of example, memory 806 may include various
tangible computer-readable storage media including Read-Only Memory (ROM) and/or Random-Access Memory (RAM).  As is well known in the art, ROM acts to transfer data and instructions uni-directionally to controller 804, and RAM is used typically to
transfer data and instructions in a bi-directional manner.  Memory 806 may also include one or more fixed storage devices in the form of, by way of example, hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), flash-memory cards (e.g., Secured Digital or
SD cards, embedded MultiMediaCard or eMMD cards), among other suitable forms of memory coupled bi-directionally to controller 804.  Information may also reside on one or more removable storage media loaded into or installed in computing platform 802 when
needed.  By way of example, any of a number of suitable memory cards (e.g., SD cards) may be loaded into computing platform 802 on a temporary or permanent basis.
<br/><br/> Input output subsystem 810 may comprise one or more input and output devices operably connected to controller 804.  For example, input output subsystem may include keyboard, mouse, one or more buttons, thumb wheel, and/or, display (e.g., liquid
crystal display (LCD), light emitting diode (LED), Interferometric modulator display (IMOD), or any other suitable display technology).  Generally, input devices are configured to transfer data, commands and responses from the outside world into
computing platform 802.  The display is generally configured to display a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides an easy to use visual interface between a user of the computing platform 802 and the operating system or application(s) running on the
mobile device.  Generally, the GUI presents programs, files and operational options with graphical images.  During operation, the user may select and activate various graphical images displayed on the display in order to initiate functions and tasks
associated therewith.  Input output subsystem 810 may also include touch based devices such as touch pad and touch screen.  A touchpad is an input device including a surface that detects touch-based inputs of users.  Similarly, a touch screen is a
display that detects the presence and location of user touch inputs.  Input output system 810 may also include dual touch or multi-touch displays or touch pads that can identify the presence, location and movement of more than one touch inputs, such as
two or three finger touches.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, computing platform 802 may additionally comprise audio subsystem 812, camera subsystem 812, wireless communication subsystem 817, sensor subsystems 817, and/or wired communication subsystem 820, operably connected to
controller 804 to facilitate various functions of computing platform 802.  For example, Audio subsystem 812, including a speaker, a microphone, and a codec module configured to process audio signals, can be utilized to facilitate voice-enabled functions,
such as voice recognition, voice replication, digital recording, and telephony functions.  For example, camera subsystem 812, including an optical sensor (e.g., a charged coupled device (CCD), or a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image
sensor), can be utilized to facilitate camera functions, such as recording photographs and video clips.  For example, wired communication subsystem 820 can include a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port for file transferring, or a Ethernet port for connection
to a local area network (LAN).
<br/><br/> Wireless communication subsystem 817 can be designed to operate over one or more wireless networks, for example, a wireless PAN (WPAN) (such as, for example, a BLUETOOTH WPAN, an infrared PAN), a WI-FI network (such as, for example, an
802.11a/b/g/n WI-FI network, an 802.11s mesh network), a WI-MAX network, a cellular telephone network (such as, for example, a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network, an Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) network, a Universal
Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) network, and/or a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network).  Additionally, wireless communication subsystem 817 may include hosting protocols such that computing platform 802 may be configured as a base station for other
wireless devices.
<br/><br/> Sensor subsystem 817 may include one or more sensor devices to provide additional input and facilitate multiple functionalities of computing platform 802.  For example, sensor subsystems 817 may include GPS sensor for location positioning,
altimeter for altitude positioning, motion sensor for determining orientation of a mobile device, light sensor for photographing function with camera subsystem 814, temperature sensor for measuring ambient temperature, and/or biometric sensor for
security application (e.g., fingerprint reader).
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, various components of computing platform 802 may be operably connected together by one or more buses (including hardware and/or software).  As an example and not by way of limitation, the one or more buses may include
an Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) or other graphics bus, an Enhanced Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus, a front-side bus (FSB), a HYPERTRANSPORT (HT) interconnect, an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, an INFINIBAND interconnect, a
