       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A method for establishing and maintaining a dynamic network designed to
     allow wireless devices to communicate with one another on an ad-hoc
     basis. The wireless network is designed specifically to function
     autonomously, remaining completely independent from relying on any
     internet service provider or any other subsidiary systems such as any
     access points or routers. Rather than using central routers, all nodes in
     the network share the same capabilities as one another, and allow for a
     dynamic routing protocol to be executed directly by the network nodes.

<br/><br/> 1.  Field of Invention
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to wireless networks and network routing protocols.  Specifically, the system is for deploying a dynamic wireless ad-hoc network that can function autonomously, in which all network nodes share the same role
functions based on their capabilities.
<br/><br/> 2.  Prior Art
<br/><br/> Several wireless communication technologies are currently commercially available.  Radio Frequency Identification technology, or RFID, can be used only for information retrieval.  Its range is also limited to approximately 3 meters.  Further
advances led to the development of infrared data transfer, near-field communications (NFC), and Bluetooth technology.  Each of these has its own shortcomings.
<br/><br/> Infrared technology requires a clear sight line between the transmitting device and the receiving device.  In addition, infrared transmissions have a limited range of approximately 5 meters.  Furthermore, infrared technology can generally only
connect two devices at one time.
<br/><br/> Near-field communications require extremely close range to operate.  The effective range is approximately 10 centimeters.  NFC is primarily used for identifying a credit card account to a payment terminal.  Popular uses include MasterCard's
PayPass and Visa's Blink programs.  Some mobile devices are now also capable of NYC transmissions, allowing individuals to make payments with their mobile devices.
<br/><br/> Bluetooth technology has a short distance maximum range.  While this range might allow for establishing a wireless network between devices, Bluetooth requires that both the transmitting device and receiving device both provide a pass code to
allow connection.  Once that connection has been established, it can be deactivated and reactivated without the need to enter the code again.  However, Bluetooth devices can only be associated with a limited number of other devices at any one time. 
Bluetooth technology is also characterized by a master-slave relationship between the two connected devices in which one device is controlling the functions of the other.  Bluetooth also requires that each slave device be synchronized to the master
device.

<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention is based, in part, on the realization that what does not exist in the marketplace is a method of creating and maintaining a dynamic wireless ad-hoc network in an asynchronous fashion, in which all devices share the same
role functionalities based on their capabilities and wherein devices can enter or leave the network at any time without causing any service disruption to the rest of the network.
<br/><br/> It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of creating and updating the topology of an asynchronous wireless ad-hoc network in a stochastic and highly dynamic environment.
<br/><br/> It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of establishing and maintaining a wireless ad-hoc network which is independent of any third party network.
<br/><br/> Is it yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of connecting multiple wireless ad-hoc networks into a single wireless ad-hoc network through a network node connected to two or more wireless ad-hoc networks.
<br/><br/> It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a method of establishing a wireless ad-hoc network without the need for a pre-existing network infrastructure.
<br/><br/> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method of establishing a wireless network in which each device shares the same role functionalities based on their capabilities.
<br/><br/> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of joining a device to and removing a device from a wireless ad-hoc network without causing any network service interruption to other devices within the network.
<br/><br/> In accordance with these and other objects, the present invention provides a method of creating and maintaining an asynchronous dynamic wireless ad-hoc network.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, wireless devices in range of one another form a network between them.  Any device that comes within range of these devices becomes part of the same network.  Each device can transmit data to its immediately neighboring
devices.  This forms a dynamic wireless ad-hoc network, or DYNAMET.  Data can be transmitted between devices that are not direct neighbors through implementation of the Redundant Dynamic Protocol (RDP).  This protocol uses information about the
connection quality of each of the neighboring devices and sends redundant packets to each device that meets a certain threshold signal quality.  The RDP tags each transmission with a code that identifies the intended destination device and a code that
identifies the source device.  When devices receive the data, the RDP compares the destination code with the recipient device's identification code.  If the codes match, the device processes the data.  If the recipient device is not the destination
device, the RDP adds the receiving device's identification code and retransmits the data to the neighboring devices that meet the propagation threshold.  This process continues in a cascade fashion until the data reaches its intended destination.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, at least one device in each of two or more separately formed DYNAMET clusters can come within range of each other.  Once a connection between such devices is established, all the clusters become a single DYNAMET unit
called a Locally Available DYNAMET (LAD).  The LAD network architecture is identical to that of a simple DYNAMET cluster.  The separate clusters that formed the LAD cease to be distinct units and merge together seamlessly and without causing any network
service interruptions.  Individual devices or whole clusters can move out of range of the LAD without causing service interruptions to either the LAD or the separated cluster.
<br/><br/> In a further embodiment DYNAMET clusters and LADs that in different geographical locations can be concatenated into a single network through an assisted connection to a Third Party Network (TPN) or Assistant Relay Node (ARN).  The devices in
each DYNAMET or LAD that contact the TPN or ARN are capable of using the TPN or ARN to relay information between each DYNAMET or LAD, creating a Globally Available DYNAMET (GAD).  The GAD also becomes a cloud-based resource to which other RDP-enabled
devices can connect.
<br/><br/> Thus, a method of deploying a dynamic wireless adhoc network and transmitting data across such a network is described. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION
<br/><br/> The following preferred embodiments as exemplified by the drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not intended to limit the invention as encompassed by the claims of this application.
<br/><br/> The invention as described herein is a dynamic and stochastic, asynchronously updated wireless ad-hoc network.
<br/><br/> In the prior art, networks are established with designated roles specific to each device.  Referring to FIG. 1, special gateway routers 104 are used to allow network access to an outside Third Party Network (TPN) 102.  Routers 103 act as nodes
and function as switches for network relaying, and end-user devices 101 play an independent role, communicating through the established network.  End-user devices do not provide any capability for additional device connection.  Such capabilities are held
only by the routers 103.  Data can be transmitted from one end-user device to another only by delivering such data to a router 103, which then relays the data to the destination device if said device is connected to the router 103.  Otherwise, the router
103 relays the data to the router to which the destination end-user device 101 is connected and that router 103 sends the data to its destination.  In this network, data may be relayed through several routers before reaching their destination.  If data
is to be transmitted to any node outside of the network, the data must be relayed from a device 101 through routers 103 to gateway 104 which is ultimately capable of relaying data to and from a TPN 102 such as the Internet.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 2, in the Dynamic Ad-Hoc Network (DYNAMET), end-user devices 201 are capable of establishing direct connections to each other, as well as gateway connections to outside TPNs.  Each end-user device 201 is also capable of
relaying data from other devices.  Rather than using routers or any centralized infrastructure, all devices in the DYNAMET share the same role functionality, allowing them to act as relays, gateways and end-users based on each device's capability.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 3, every device in the DYNAMET searches for other available devices 301.  Every device has a unique identification code.  This code, hereinafter referred to as a Unique Device Identifier (UDID) is used both for
identification of a device as well as to target data to a specific destination device.  Each device in the DYNAMET contains a neighbors quality table in which it maintains a listing of known neighboring devices and their respective connection quality, in
addition to neighboring devices' functional capabilities, along with their various time functions, which will be discussed below.  In the DYNAMET when a device detects a UDID within its range 302, it checks its self-recorded evaluation records to
retrieve its own evaluated parameters 303.  The discovering device and the newly found device then exchange UDIDs along with their self-recorded tables containing their evaluated parameters 304.  Connection quality between the two devices is then
recorded, which is an evaluation available connection parameters such as the signal strength, connection data rate, retransmission rate, packet loss ratio, and any other available parameters to be evaluated 305.  The device is then checked against the
list of recorded neighbors to see if its UDID is already listed in the table 306.  If the UDID is already listed, the device updates its neighbors quality table 307.  If the UDID is not listed, a table record is created for the UDID with its evaluated
neighbor quality 308.  The discovery process then repeats itself.
<br/><br/> The DYNAMET has an inherently dynamic network topology.  Nodes constantly move toward or away from each other.  Each node device must keep its self-evaluation table record updated in order to maintain an up-to-date neighbors quality table, both
for itself and for its neighbors.  Referring to FIG. 4, a node first evaluates its device capability 401.  The node gathers all information relevant to its performance in the DYNAMET.  Available resources are then identified by the device 402 in order to
calculate a self-evaluated neighbor quality (Q(n)), which is calculated based on many variables including connection quality and functional abilities, along with various functions of time.  As stated above, connection quality is measured based on signal
strength, connection data rate, retransmission rate, packet loss ratio, and other factors for each neighboring device.  These data are found in the neighbors quality table for each UDID for which the device has a record.  Functional abilities include the
function role of a device (i.e. a relay node, assistant relay node or border node), number of neighbors available, battery life, wireless media available, hardware components and device capabilities, third-party resources such as GPS, speedometers or
accelerometers to determine position, speed or acceleration.  The state of these functional abilities is then evaluated 403.  The node detects what functions are in use, such as the current battery life, what wireless media are currently in use. 
Additionally, various time functions such as the total time a device is connected to the DYNAMET, the time spent connected to a specific neighbor, and the time spent performing role functionalities are analyzed 404.  All variables are evaluated together
to determine Q(n) for the device.  The Q(n) and associated parameter data is then recorded in the device's self-evaluation table 405.  This record is then available to be shared with any device executing the discovery process described above.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 5, when data is to be transmitted from one device to another the transmitting device, or source device, first analyzes the UDID of the destination device and the threshold parameter y 501 and generates a data packet 502
that is targeted to the destination UDID.  This is achieved through use of a packet header which contains the destination UDID as well as the source UDID.  This allows any receiving device to determine where the packet originated and where it must be
sent.  The source device then compares the destination UDID to the entries in its connections table in order to determine if the destination UDID is a neighboring device 503.  If the destination UDID is listed, the source device sends the packet directly
to the destination device 504.  If the UDID is not listed, the source device checks to make sure that there are any connections currently available in its connections table 505.  If not, the sending process is notified that no connections are available
506 and transmission of the packet is aborted.  If connections are available, the source device adds a signature representing its own UDID to the path table in the packet 507 and then transmits redundant copies of the packet to its highest priority
connections, i.e. neighboring UDIDs listed in the connections table whose Q(n) value is in coherence with a determined threshold value y 508 which is calculated and determined by the particular application being run on the DYNAMET 509.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 6, when a device receives a packet 600, it must decide what action to take.  The receiving device first analyzes the path table in the packet and the threshold value y 601, which is set by the particular application being run,
and can differ based on the particular application's requirements.  The receiving device also analyzes the destination UDID 602.  If the destination UDID matches the UDID of the receiving device, the receiving device processes the packet 603.  If the
destination UDID does not match that of the receiving device, the receiving device parses the packet signatures 604.  11 the receiving device's signature is present, indicating that the receiving device is either the source device or has already received
and relayed the packet prior to its receipt of the instant duplicate, the receiving device discards the packet 609.  If the receiving device's signature is not present in the packet, the device compares the destination UDID to the entries in its
connections table in order to determine if the destination UDID is a neighboring device 605.  If the destination UDID is listed in the connections table, the receiving device transmits the packet directly to the destination device 606.  If the
destination UDID is not listed in the connections table, the receiving device will attempt to relay the packet to its highest priority neighbors.  In order to prevent a duplicate from being transmitted back to the device from which the packet was
received, that device's UDID, represented by the first signature in the packet path table, is masked from the connections table 607.  The receiving device then checks for any other entries in the connections table 608.  If there are connections
available, the receiving device appends its signature to the packet 610 and sends redundant packets to its designated top priority neighbors 611 in coherence with the determined threshold value y.
<br/><br/> In order to prevent packets transmitted over a large number of nodes from becoming too large, the space reserved in each packet for the path table is of a fixed size and is capable only of storing a certain number n signatures.  Each signature
can have a position value no greater than n. Referring to FIG. 7, when a device 701 transmits a packet to a destination device 702, it inserts its signature as the first entry of the path table 7031.  As the packet is retransmitted by each intervening
node, those devices append their signatures in front of the previous signature 7032, 7033.  As each new signature is added, each preexisting signature is pushed down the table, forcing the oldest signature to approach position n. If the limit n is
reached before the packet reaches the destination device, the signature at position n is removed, creating space for each subsequent signature which follow the same systematic process of pushing all signatures toward n. These signatures prevent packet
propagation from occurring infinitely between devices that are not the destination device.  Any device which recognizes its own signature in the packet will discard the packet as a duplicate.
<br/><br/> For example, referring to FIG. 8, Node 1 801 transmits a packet to Node 2 802.  The path table in the packet contains only the signature of Node 1 8011.  Node 2 802 receives the packet and retransmits to Node 3 803 and Node 4 804, adding its
signature to the front of the path table in each redundant packet 8021, 8022.  Node 3 803 receives the packet and transmits it to Node 4 804, adding its signature in front of Node 2's 802 signature 8031.  Node 4 804 also receives the packet and transmits
it to Node 3 803, adding its signature in front of Node 2's 802 signature 8041.  When Node 3 803 receives the packet sent from Node 4 804, it does not recognize that it is a duplicate packet because Node 3's 803 signature is not included in the path
table 8041.  Node 3 803 therefore adds its signature in front of Node 4's 804 signature 8032 and transmits the packet to Node 2 802, which recognizes its own signature in the packet and discards it as a duplicate 805.  When Node 4 804 receives the packet
from Node 3 803, it also does not recognize that the packet is a duplicate because its own signature is not included.  Node 4 804 therefore adds its signature in front of Node 3's 803 signature 8042 and transmits the packet to Node 2 802, which
recognizes that the packet is a duplicate and discards it 806.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 9 as an example of packet propagation using the RDP, Node 1 901 is the source device.  Node 1 901 generates a packet whose destination is Node 14 914.  Node 1 901 has only one neighboring device, Node 2 902.  Node 1 901 has
no option but to transmit a redundant packet to Node 2 902.  When Node 2 902 receives the packet, the RDP identifies the source and destination devices from the UDIDs in the packet header and the device from which the packet was received (the sender)
using the first signature in the packet path table, which at this time matches the source UDID in the packet header.  The RDP masks the sender's UDID from Node 2's 902 connections table, leaving only Node 3 903 as a valid option for transmission of the
packet.  This process is repeated at Node 3 903, transmitting a redundant packet to Node 4 904.  In this example, Node 4 904 has a Q(n) threshold value y such that redundant packets will only be sent to Node 5 905 and Node 6 906.  Node 4 904 will
therefore send redundant packets only to its top two priority neighbors.  In this example, redundant packet A 9041A is sent to Node 5 905 and redundant packet B 9041B is sent to Node 6 906.  Redundant packet A 9041A can be relayed from Node 5 905 to Node
8 908, from Node 8 908 to Node 11 911 and from Node 11 911 to Node 9 909.  At Node 9 909, the RDP can relay a redundant packet to Node 5 905 where it will be recognized as a duplicate 916 due to Node 5's 905 signature in the path table.  A redundant
packet can also be relayed to Node 12 912.  At Node 12 912 the RDP recognizes that the destination device, Node 14 914, is a direct neighbor of Node 12 912 and relay a non-redundant packet to Node 14 914.  Node 9 909 can also relay a redundant packet to
Node 6 906.  At Node 6 906, the RDP can relay a redundant packet to Node 4 904 where it will be discarded as a duplicate 915 due to Node 4's 904 signature in the path table.  A redundant packet can also be relayed to Node 10 910.  At Node 10 910, the RDP
can relay redundant packets to Node 12 912, Node 13 913 and Node 7 907.  At both Node 12 912 and Node 13 913, the RDP will recognize that Node 114 914 is a direct neighbor and send a non-redundant packet to Node 14 914.  Node 7 907 will send a redundant
packet to Node 4 904 where it will be discarded as a duplicate 915.
<br/><br/> Returning to redundant packet A 9041A received at Node 5 905, a redundant packet can also be sent to Node 9 909.  A redundant packet can be relayed from Node 9 909 to Node 11 911, from Node 11 911 to Node 8 908 and from Node 8 908 back to Node 5
905 where it will be discarded as a duplicate 916.  Node 9 909 can also relay a redundant packet to Node 6 906 which will in turn relay a redundant packet to Node 4 904, where it will be discarded 915, and to Node 10 910.  At Node 10 910 the RDP will
relay redundant packets to Node 12 912, Node 13 913 and Node 7 907.  Nodes 12 and 13 912 913 will relay a non-redundant packet directly to Node 114 914.  Node 7 907 will relay a redundant packet to Node 4 904 where it will be discarded 915.  Node 9 909
can further relay a redundant packet to Node 12 912 where it will be sent directly to Node 14 914.
<br/><br/> Returning to redundant packet B 9041B received at Node 6 906, the RDP can relay a redundant packet to Node 9 909, which can relay a redundant packet to Node 12 912 which will be sent directly to Node 14 914, Node 9 909 can also send a redundant
packet to Node 11 911 which will relay a redundant packet to Node 8 908 and from Node 8 908 to Node 5 905.  At Node 5 905, a redundant packet can be relayed to both Node 4 904 and back to Node 9 909.  Both nodes will discard the packet as a duplicate
915, 917.  Node 9 909 can also relay a redundant packet to Node 5 905, which will relay the redundant packet to Node 4 904 where it will be discarded 915, and to Node 8 908 where it will be relayed to Node 11 911 and from Node 11 911 back to Node 9 909
where it will be discarded 917.  Node 6 606 can also relay a redundant packet to Node 10 910, which can relay redundant packets to Node 12 912, Node 13 913 and Node 7 907.  From Nodes 12 and 13 912, 913 the packet will be sent directly to Node 14 914. 
From Node 7 907, a redundant packet will be sent back to Node 4 904 where it will be discarded 915.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the invention one or more DYNAMET nodes may be equipped with a GPS location device.  In such an embodiment, the GPS-enabled nodes may use the physical location of the destination node to determine to which neighboring nodes
redundant packets will be sent.  This is achieved by using a propagation forming algorithm rather than the IRP.  A node executing the propagation forming algorithm determines in which direction the destination node lies, and only sends redundant packets
to nodes that fall within that directional corridor.  This results in a more efficient packet propagation that the standard IRP propagation.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 10, when independently created DYNAMET clusters 1001, 1002, 1003 come within range of each other, the RDP allows communication between all nodes in all clusters.  This results in a single larger DYNAMET cluster called a
Locally Available DYNAMET (LAD) 1004.  This expansion occurs with no network interruptions.  Since the DYNAMET is an inherently asynchronous network, there are no issue of synchronization between the different clusters that form the LAD 1004.  When
clusters 1005, 1006, 1007 within the LAD 1004 move out of each other's range, they become independent clusters once again.  These clusters need not be identical to those which form the LAD 1004.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 11, multiple DYNAMET clusters 1100 can function as a single LAD 1102 even when clusters 1100 have only one node that is in communications range of a node in another cluster 1100.
<br/><br/> Within the DYNAMET, every node can communicate with every other node.  In addition, each node can also act as a Relay Node (RN) and a Border Node (BN).  All nodes are RNs, which perform the routing in the DYNAMET by carrying out the RDP.  BNs
can link DYNAMET clusters with a third party network (TPN).  In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 12, the DYNAMET cluster 1200 can access a TPN 1202 via a BN 1201.  Each RN 1203 can direct packets to the TPN 1202 by targeting the BN 1201.  The BN 1201
forwards the packets to the TPN 1202.  Response packets from the TPN 1202 are received by the BN 1201 and redundant packets are relayed using the RDP.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG, 13, within a single DYNAMET cluster 1300, more than one node can act as a BN 1301, 1305.  The BNs 1301, 1305 can implement the RDP over the TPN 1302, effectively utilizing the TPN 1302 as an additional node.  For example, a
packet sent from RN-7 1303 to RN-4 1304 would be transmitted from RN-7 1303 to RN-2, RN-6 and BN-1 1301.  From BN-1 1301, the packet is transmitted directly to BN-2 1305 via their mutual connection to a TPN 1302.  BN-2 1305 then transmits a non-redundant
copy of the packet to its direct neighbor, RN-4 1304.  This can also be achieved if BN-1 1301 and BN-5 1305 are connected to different TPNs.  So long as the TPNs can communicate with each other, packets can be transmitted between the two BNs 1301, 1305.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 14, several separated DYNAMET clusters 1400 can function as a single DYNAMET through each cluster's connection to a TPN 1402.  The resulting functional DYNAMET is referred to as a Globally Available DYNAMET (GAD) 1401.  Each BN
1403 can transmit packets to any other BN 1403 in all other clusters 1400.  In this way, each separate cluster 1400 can communicate with each other just as though an LAD has been formed between them.  Their interconnectivity is held as a GAD 1401 on the
cloud 1404 as a resource available to any additional clusters 1405 that connect to the TPN 1402.  As with LADs, if any cluster leaves the TPN 1402, the remainder of the GAD 1401 suffers no service interruption.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 15, the GAD 1503 can also be created across multiple TPNs 1502.  Each cluster 1500 can connect to a TPN 1502 via BNs 1501.  So long as each TPN 1502 can communicate with each other TPN 1502, a GAD 1503 can be created.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the invention, the time required to propagate a packet from source to destination can be minimized through the use of an Assistant Relay Node (ARN).  An ARN is functionally equivalent to any ordinary Relay Node.  However, an
ARN possesses the ability to establish many more simultaneous connections than an RN and may have increased range.  This is achieved through increased equipment capabilities, positioning, or both.  For example, an ARN may be a stationary or mobile device
with higher power capabilities compared with the average commercial or off-the-shelf mobile device battery.  An ARN may also be positioned above all other nodes such that in can communicates with many of them simultaneously.  Such ARNs may be mounted,
for example, on top of buildings, telephone poles, cell towers, unmanned aerial drones, or other similar implementations.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 16, nodes 1601 in a DYNAMET cluster 1600 communicate with each neighboring node directly 1603.  In order to communicate with any RN beyond its direct neighbors, a RN node 1601 must utilize direct neighbors to implement the RDP
to propagate the information across the DYNAMET to the destination node.  An ARN 1602 can communicate directly 1604 with any RN 1601 in the cluster 1600.  With such communication between each RN 1601 and the ARN 1602, RNs 1601 can utilize the ARN 1602 in
their implementation of the RDP, and there is almost always a direct connection between the ARN 1602 and both the source and destination nodes 1601.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 17, a packet sent from RN-1 1701 to RN-7 1702 can be propagated throughout the cluster 1700 using direct connections 1705 between each node until it reaches RN-7 1702, requiring at least 3 propagations.  RN-1 1701 can also send
a redundant packet to the ARN 1703.  The ARN 1703 is in direct communication 1704 with both RN-1 1701 and RN-7 1702.  The ARN 1703 recognizes RN-7 1702 as a direct neighbor and transmits a non-redundant packet directly to RN-7 1702.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 18, an ARN 1801 is capable of linking several separated DYNAMET clusters 1800.  The ARN 1801 can establish connections to nodes in multiple clusters 1800 that are otherwise out of each other's range to form direct connections
or to form a LAD.  The ARN 1801 links the clusters 1800 to form a single DYNAMET 1802.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 19, an ARN 1901 can also facilitate creation of a GAD.  The ARN 1901 may establish a connection 1902 with one or more TPNs 1903, while also linking local separated clusters 1900 into a LAD 1904.  This results in the
concatenation of both the LAD 1904 and the clusters 1905 connected to the TPNs 1903 to be supported on the cloud.
<br/><br/> Thus, an asynchronous dynamic wireless ad-hoc network has been provided.  One skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention can be practiced by other that the described embodiments, which are presented for purposes of
