       <p> Systems and methods for collecting information from digital media files.
     More specifically, a collection module may be used to communicate with a
     social networking system and analyze the digital media files associated
     with a user profile. The collection module may generate media-based
     profile information based on media content and/or location, time and date
     data extracted from the digital media files. The media-based profile
     information may be incorporated into the user profile information and
     used by the social networking system for various purposes.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> The following detailed description is exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention any way.  Rather, the following description provides some practical illustrations for implementing
some embodiments of the present invention.  Those skilled in the art will recognize that many of the noted examples have a variety of suitable alternatives.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of a social networking system 10 that may be used according to an embodiment of the invention.  Social networking system 10 may represent any conventional social networking site and may include a plurality of
user profiles 12 associated to respective users of social networking system 10.  Generally, individuals may create a user profile on social networking system 10 via a website (not shown).  As will be discussed in further detail below, social networking
system 10 generally provides a means to connect individuals with each other based on some commonality between the user profiles of the individuals.  Social networking system 10 may include user profile 14 that is associated with a user.  User profile 14
may include profile information 16 and digital media files 18.
<br/><br/> Profile information 16 may be any social networking information specified by a user and may be provided, for example, when the user creates or updates user profile 14.  Profile information 16 may include any social networking information
pertaining to the individual including, but not limited to, biographical, personal, professional and education information.  Social networking system 10 may match user profile 14 with other user profiles based on a commonality between the profile
information of the user profiles.  For example, the profile information of a first user profile may include social networking information that specifies that the user attended ACME High School.  Social networking system 10 may use this information to
connect the user with other user profiles with profile information specifying attendance at ACME High School.
<br/><br/> User profile 14 may also include a plurality of digital media files 18.  Digital media files 18 may be, for example, any photo, movie or sound recording in an electronic format.  Digital media files 18 may be uploaded to user profile 14 on
social networking system 10 by the user.  As will be discussed below, digital media files 18 may be uploaded to the website of the social networking system 10 from a computer connected to the internet.  In another example, the digital media file may be
uploaded to a user profile directly from a mobile device with internet connectivity, like a cell phone, smart phone or tablet.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of a generating device 20 that may be used to generate digital media files according to an embodiment of the invention.  Generating device 20 may be any device capable of capturing, storing and transferring a
digital media file, for example a video camera, cell phone, smart phone, tablet, laptop, computer or scanner.  Generating device 20 may include one or more of a camera 22, microphone 24, location sensor 30, wireless radio 32, cellular radio 34,
non-volatile memory 28, connector 36, processor 26 and bus 38.
<br/><br/> Camera 22 and microphone 24 may be used to capture digital media content.  For example, camera 22 may be used to take pictures, microphone 24 may be used to collect sound recordings, or the two components may be used in tandem to capture a video
with sound.
<br/><br/> Generating device 20 may also include location sensor 30 configured to receive location data and/or time and date data.  Location data may be any data that represents a geographic location.  In one example, location sensor 30 may be a global
positioning system (GPS) receiver that receives a latitude and longitude coordinate as well as time and date data from a global positioning system.
<br/><br/> Wireless radio 32 may be configured to connect generating device 20 to a wireless network to send and receive information.  In one example, wireless radio 32 may be configured to communicate on a WLAN network using IEEE 802.11 protocols. 
Cellular radio 34 may be configured to connect generating device 20 to a cellular network also to send and receive information.  Wireless radio 32 and/or cellular radio 34 may also be configured to receive location data and time and date data.  In one
example, wireless radio 32 may collect signal strength of nearby WLAN access points and triangulate a location based on the known location of the access points.  In another example, wireless radio 32 may communicate the signal strength to a third-party
service, like Skyhook Wireless Inc., to help triangulate a location and return location data to generating device 20.  Similarly, in another example, cellular radio 34 may user similar methods using the signal strength from nearby cellular towers.
<br/><br/> Generating device 20 may also include a processor 26 to drive and control all the components of the device.  In one example, processor 26 may be used to combine the digital media content captured by camera 22 and/or microphone 24 with the
location data received or derived from location sensor 30, wireless radio 32 and/or cellular radio 34 to create a digital media file 40 (illustrated in FIG. 3).  In another example, generating device 20 may not include location sensor 20 or wireless
radio 32 and time and date data may be derived from a clock (not shown) of generating device 20.  The resulting digital media file 40 may then include location data descriptive of a geographic location where the digital media file 40 was created. 
Similarly, processor 26 may be used to append time and date data descriptive of the time and date digital media file was created.  Digital media file 40 may be stored on non-volatile memory 28 where it may be transferred to a computer via connector 36,
or directly uploaded to a user profile 14 of social networking system 10 via the wireless radio 32 or cellular radio 34.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates a block diagram of a digital media file 40 which may be used according to an embodiment of the invention.  Digital media file 40 may include media content 42, location data 44 and time and date data 46.  As noted above, media
content 42 may be an electronic picture, movie, recording or any other media in an electronic format, and location data 44 may be any data that represents a geographic location.  In one example, digital media file 40 may be formatted in accordance with
the exchangeable image file (Exif) standard for images, sounds used by digital cameras, smart phones, scanners and other systems handling image and sound files for digital cameras and smart phones.  Other examples of standards for digital media files
include TIFF, TIFF/EP and DCF formats.  In a different example, digital media file 40 may not include location data, time and date data, or both.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a system 50 for collecting social networking information according to an embodiment of the invention.  System 50 includes social networking system 10 as illustrated in FIG. 1.  As noted above, social networking
system 10 includes user profile 14 which includes profile information 16 and digital media files 18.  Additionally, system 50 may include a collecting module 52, a data repository 54, a mobile device 56 and a computer 58.  Generally, system 50 provides
for the automatic collection of social networking information from digital media associated with a user profile.  The method of automatic collection is described below in greater detail with reference to FIG. 5.
<br/><br/> Collecting module 52 may be configured to automatically communicate with social networking system 10, access and analyze profile information 16 and digital media files 18 of user profile 14, and automatically generate social networking
information based on digital media files 18.  The term "communicating" may include read and write access to information contained in an element.  The analysis of the digital media files 18 may require collecting module 52 to communicate with data
repository 54.  Data repository 54 may comprise a single database or multiple databases, and may be stored in one or more computer-readable memory devices, such as a hard disk drive, solid state memory or another form of computer memory.  Data repository
54 may also be housed within or in communication with one or more computers.  In some examples, data repository 54 may be part of an existing software application.
<br/><br/> It should be appreciated that depiction of collecting module 52 as a module is intended to highlight different functional aspects and does not necessarily imply that such modules or units must be realized by separate hardware or software
components.  Rather, functionality associated with one or more modules or units may be performed by separate hardware or software components, or integrated within common or separate hardware or software components.
<br/><br/> System 50 may also include mobile device 56 and/or computer 58.  Mobile device 56 may be a cell phone, smart phone or PDA as illustrated in FIG. 2, and computer 58 may be a desktop computer, laptop or tablet.  Mobile device 56 and computer 58
may communicate with social networking system 10 to modify user profile 14.  More specifically, mobile device 56 and computer 58 may create or update the personal information of user profile 14.  Furthermore, mobile device 56 and computer 58 may be
configured to capture and upload digital media files to user profile 14.  As noted above, digital media files may be transferred from mobile device 56 to computer 58, where it is then uploaded to user profile 14.
<br/><br/> Of course, the system shown in FIG. 4 is just one example of a possible system configuration for providing the functionality described herein.  In describing various examples of the invention, many aspects of the examples are discussed herein in
terms of functionality, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence.  Examples of the invention may be implemented using a combination of hardware, firmware, and/or software.  For example, in many cases some or all of the
functionality provided by examples may be implemented in executable software instructions capable of being carried on a programmable computer processor.  Likewise, some examples of the invention include a computer-readable storage device on which such
executable software instructions are stored.  In certain examples, a system processor itself may contain instructions to perform one or more tasks, such as in cases where collecting module 52, data repository 54 and social networking system 10 are
referenced.  System processing capabilities are not limited to any specific configuration and those skilled in the art will appreciate that the teachings provided herein may be implemented in a number of different manners.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 70 for collecting social networking information from digital media files according to an embodiment of the invention.  More specifically, method 70 may help identify potential interests of an
individual associated with a user profile based on where and when the digital media file was taken and/or the content of the digital media file.
<br/><br/> The initial step of method 70 may include receiving 72 a digital media file.  The term "receiving" is used herein to generally refer to the granting of access in any form to a digital media file, or simply being alerted of the presence and
location of a digital media file.  In one example, receiving 72 may include a social networking system 10 granting a software application access to the digital media files 18 in a user profile 14.  In another example, receiving 72 may include a social
networking system 10 sending a software application a pointer to digital media files 18 in a user profile 14.  As illustrated, this example includes a situation in which a user posts a link to an online video (i.e. a YouTube video), and receiving 72 may
include simply sending a link to an online video.  In a different example, receiving 72 a digital file may include copying or transferring the file to the computer-readable memory of a computer that is programmed to perform the method 70.
<br/><br/> Upon receiving 72 a digital media file, content analysis 74 may be performed to determine potential interests.  More specifically, content analysis 74 may use media recognition technologies to determine a suspected content of the digital media
file which in turn may be used to determine potential interests.  Media recognition technologies may include, but is not limited to, image, sound, voice, music, video and optical character recognition technologies.  Potential interests may be determined
based on the suspected content of the digital media file.  For example, image recognition software may analyze an electronic digital media file including a picture and identify that the picture includes the sky, the sun, a shovel, flowers and plants and
an individual kneeling.  The suspected content may include the above-identified elements of the picture, and based on the suspected content potential interests may include outdoors, gardening, flowers, etc. In another example, a digital media file of a
song may be analyzed by a music recognition software to generate suspected content including the song title, artist, album, etc. Thus, potential interests based on this suspected content may include a music genre, an era of music, or other interests
affiliated with a certain style of music.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, different recognition technologies may be used in combination to collect more suspected content.  The additional suspected content may be used to increase or gage the accuracy of potential interests or simply to identify more
potential interests.  For example, a picture of an individual at a sporting event may be analyzed by both an image recognition and optical character recognition software.  The image recognition software may identify a logo of a team and the optical
character recognition software may identify a name of a team in the picture.  In one example, the image recognition software and the optical character recognition software may identify the same team, thus it is likely accurate that the individual is a
fan of the team.  In another example, the imaging recognition software and the optical character recognition software may identify different teams (i.e. a home team and an away team).  Both teams may be identified as potential interests but the
conflicting information may later be used in generating a confidence interval that the team is actually an interest of the individual.  As above, the determination of potential interests corresponding to the suspected content of a digital media file may
require accessing a data repository that correlates potential interests with locations, times dates.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, or additionally, data analysis 76 of the digital media file may be performed to determine where and when the digital media file was created.  FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 100 for performing data analysis.  The
initial step may include receiving 101 a digital media file and extracting 102 location data from the digital media file.  As noted above, a digital media file may include location data indicative of where a digital media file was created.  A geographic
location represented by the location data may be determined 106 by accessing a data repository that correlates the location data with a geographic location.  For example, the location data extracted 104 from the digital media file may be a GPS coordinate
expressed in latitude and longitude.  The geographic location represented by the GPS coordinate may be determined by accessing a data repository that correlates GPS coordinates with geographic locations.  Similarly, time and date data may be extracted
104 from the digital media file indicative of a time and date when the digital media file was created.  The time and date data may then be used along with the geographic location to determine 108 event information associated with the digital media file. 
Event information may be determined by accessing a data repository that correlates geographic information and time and date information with event information.  For example, where a photograph was taken at the Sydney Opera House, cross referencing the
geographic location with a time and data may yield an event that occurred at that venue on that particular day.
<br/><br/> Potential interests may then be generated 110 based on the geographic location and/or the event information.  For example, it may be determined that a digital media file was created in Sydney, Australia at the Sydney Opera House.  Based on this
information, potential interests for the individual associated with the digital media file may include music, concerts, opera, orchestra, classical music, etc. Generating 110 potential interests corresponding to a geographic location may require
accessing a data repository that correlates potential interests with geographic locations.  Similarly, potential interests may also be generated 110 based on event information.  For example, it may be determined that a U2 concert took place at the Sydney
Opera House on the day a digital media file was created and thus potential interests generated 110 may include more specific interests such as "rock concerts" or "Bono" based on the event information.  Event information may still be useful in generating
110 potential interests even if there is no formal event that corresponds with the geographic location and time and date data.  For example, a photograph may be taken in the middle of a lake in Minnesota, USA.  If the photograph was taken in the summer,
then potential interests may include boating, swimming, fishing, sun bathing, the outdoors, etc. Conversely, if the photograph was taken in the winter, then potential interests may include ice fishing, ice skating, riding snow mobiles, cross country
skiing, the outdoors, etc. As above, generating 110 potential interests corresponding to event information may require accessing a data repository that correlates potential interests with event information.
<br/><br/> Referring back to FIG. 5, it should be noted that the identification of potential interests occurring in data analysis 76 and content analysis 74 is not limited to any degree of specificity.  It should be appreciated that very broad interest
categories like "music" or "enjoys the outdoors" may have comparable value to more specific interests in similar categories like "European free jazz" and "hiking the Bad Lands of South Dakota," respectively.  In some embodiments, more specific interests
identified by data analysis may be further classified into less specific, broader categories of interests.  This may be accomplished by correlating more specific interests to broader categories of interests according to information included in the data
repository 54, for example.  The interests included in the media-based profile information may therefore include more specific interests identified by analyzing the media and/or more general categories of interests identified by association with the more
specific interests.  For example, a user with media indicating an interest in a particular basketball team may be classified specifically as a fan of the particular team, or more generally as a fan of basketball, or further more generally as a fan of
spectator sports.  Any one or all three of these interests, from the most specific to the most general, may be included in the user profile.  It may be important to note that the classification of interests into categories is not limited to the scope
(e.g., specificity or broadness) of the interest.  Furthermore, the categories of interests may be correlated on a basis other than the scope of the interest.  For example, the interest category of "enjoys skateboarding" may be correlated with the
category "enjoys alternative rock music," even though neither interest is a broader or more specific category of the other.
<br/><br/> It should also be appreciated that any of the methods discussed in relation to data analysis 76 and content analysis 74 may be used alone or in any combination with each other.  As noted above, method 70 is an exemplary example which employs all
the methods discussed above.  Advantages of generating a more exhaustive list of interests is explained below when media-based profile information is generated 82.
<br/><br/> Once the digital media file has been analyzed, the potential interests identified in the data analysis and the content analysis may be compiled to generate 78 a list of potential interests for the individual associated with the digital media
file.  The list of potential interest is associated with the digital media file from which it was derived.  The list may specify, or not, the method by which the potential interests were identified.  For example, a list may be generated 78 that notes
which potential interests were identified by data analysis 76 and content analysis 74.  In another example, a list may be generated with more specificity, identifying the recognition technology used in identifying a potential interest.  In a different
example, generating a list may simply be compiling all the potential interests into a raw list with additional information.  As will be discussed below, the method by which a potential interest was identified may be helpful in determining a confidence or
accuracy interval for a potential interest.
<br/><br/> Once a list of potential interests for a particular digital media file has been generated 78, method 70 determines whether there are any additional digital media files to analyze in step 80.  If there are additional files, method 70 will receive
72 the file, perform data analysis 76 and content analysis 74 on the file, then generate 78 a list of potential interests for that particular digital media file.  These steps are repeated until it is determined in step 80 that there are no additional
media files, at which point method 70 continues on to generating 82 media-based profile information.
<br/><br/> Media-based profile information may then be generated 82 by examining the lists of potential interests for each digital media file.  Media-based profile information is profile information that is derived from digital media files and includes
interests from the lists of potential interests most likely to be applicable to the individual associated with the user profile.  Media-based profile information may be characteristically similar to profile information 16 discussed in FIG. 1.  For
example media-based profile information, like profile information 16, may contain social networking information including, but not limited to, biographical, personal, professional and education information.  As will be discussed below, it may be
advantageous to differentiate profile information derived from a digital media file from user-specified profile information when the two are incorporated 84 into the user profile.
<br/><br/> Generally, generating 82 media-based profile information may include categorizing and assigning an accuracy or confidence interval to the potential interests, then based on the confidence interval, selecting the interests most likely to be
associated with a user profile.  In generating 82 the media-based profile information, method 70 may individually examine the list of potential interests for each digital media file and assign a confidence interval for each unique potential interest in
the list.  Method 70 may then collectively analyze and consolidate the potential interests lists from all the digital media files to generate 72 the media-based profile information.
<br/><br/> In determining a confidence interval, method 70 may compare the potential interests with profile information specified by an individual in a user profile.  For example, recall the example above where analyzing a picture taken at the Sydney Opera
House yielded a list of potential interests including music, concerts, opera, orchestra, classical music, etc. Where an individual specifies in the user profile that they really enjoy music, method 70 may assign a higher confidence interval to these
interests.  Conversely, where a user specifies that they dislike music, a lower confidence interval may be assigned to these potential interests.  Comparing a list of potential interests to the profile information of the user profile may also yield new
potential interests based on the context provided by the user specified profile information.  Again referencing the example of a picture taken at the Sydney Opera House, if the individual specifies in the user profile that they live in New York, N.Y.,
then the potential interest list may be expanded to include tourism, traveling, Australia, Sydney, etc.
<br/><br/> Many factors may be considered when determining the confidence interval for a particular potential interest.  For example, method 70 may take into account repetition, category and method or source of the potential interests.
<br/><br/> In determining the confidence interval for a potential interest, method 70 may take into account the number of times a potential interest is repeated in a list of potential interests for a specific digital media file as well as the number of
digital media files that include that particular potential interest.  For example, if the potential interest "likes basketball" appears in a list of potential interest several times, then a high confidence interval may be assigned to that interest.  If
that same interest occurs in numerous digital media files, then an even higher confidence interval may be assigned to that interest.
<br/><br/> The categories of the potential interests may also be taken into account when determining confidence intervals for the interests.  Generally, the lack of repetition of a potential interest does not necessarily mean that an individual does not
have that interest.  For example, the interest "like European free jazz" may only occur once in only one digital media file.  Method 70 may still assign a higher confidence interval to the interest, however, where the individual has many other interests,
user specified or otherwise, related to music and jazz.
<br/><br/> Also, as already noted above, the method or source by which a potential interest is derived may be taken into account when determining a confidence interval.  Generally, a higher confidence interval may be assigned to potential interests
determined using more reliable methods.  For example, where video recognition technology is behind or inferior to image recognition technology, an interests derived from the latter may be assigned a higher confidence interval than one derived from the
former.  Or, method 70 may value data analysis above content analysis and therefore assign higher confidence intervals to potential interests derived from the former.  Similarly, method 70 may favor potential interests from certain digital media files
over others.  For example, a lower confidence interval may be assigned to interests derived from a digital media file that does not include location, time and date data than interests derived from a file including that data.
<br/><br/> Once confidence intervals are assigned to the potential interests, media-based profile information may be generated 82 by selecting interests that have a confidence interval above a certain threshold.  While only a number of factors have been
discussed, it can be appreciated that method 70 may take into account many other factors in determining confidence intervals.
<br/><br/> After the media-based profile information has been generated 82, method 70 may incorporate 84 the media-based profile information into a user profile.  The method of incorporation may vary based on the type and objectives of a social network
system.  Different types of social network systems may include social networks (e.g. <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, Instagram), dating networks (e.g. Match.com, eHarmony), or professional network (e.g. LinkedIn).  Different objectives may include, but are not
limited to, generating better matches between users, streamlining the entry of profile information into a user profile, ensuring accuracy of user specified profile information, targeting commercial advertising and/or enhancing the user experience.
<br/><br/> A social networking system may privately incorporate the media-based profile information into a user profile to generate better matches between users.  For example, a user who has attended ACME High School may not have specified in their user
profile that they attended that school.  As a result, a social networking system may not know to connect the user with other individuals who have attended ACME High School.  However, the user may have uploaded numerous digital media files of photos that
were taken at ACME High School during a specific time span.  Using this media-based profile information, the social networking system may suggest other users who attended ACME High School during the same time span.
<br/><br/> A social networking system may also publically incorporate the media-based profile information directly into a user profile to streamline the process of creating or updating the profile.  In one example, when a user uploads digital media files
in creating or updating a user profile, method 70 may automatically generate 82 media-based profile information from the uploaded files and automatically populate the user profile with suggested interests.  This example of incorporating 84 may be more
suitable for casual social network systems.  In other social network systems, like dating and professional networks, a user may be more sensitive to the content of their user profile.  In such networks, method 70 may prompt or suggest interests to the
user and allow the user to accept or decline the suggested interests before incorporating them into the user profile.
<br/><br/> Certain social networks may be interested in ensuring the accuracy of user specified profile information.  For example, a dating network may be wary of individuals who misrepresent themselves in their user profiles.  Method 70 may then use the
media-based profile information to automatically correct a user profile where it determines that the profile information reflects a misrepresentation.  In another example, method 70 may generate an accuracy metric for each user profile based on a
comparison between user specified profile information and media-based profile information.  The accuracy metric may be private to help network administrators identify deviant users, or the accuracy metric may be publicly displayed in the user profile for
the benefit of other users.
<br/><br/> In another example, the media-based profile information may be incorporated into the user profile in such a way that enables the social networking system to display relevant commercial advertisements to an individual.  For example, a user may
not have specified that they like basketball in their user profile, but have uploaded digital media files indicating an interest in basketball.  The social networking system may then use this media-based profile information to display basketball related
content to the individual.
<br/><br/> In a similar example, the social networking system may use the media-based profile information to enhance the user experience.  For example, a user may not have specified that they are a diehard Manchester United fan but they have uploaded
numerous digital media files that indicate that interest.  Using this media-based profile information, the social networking system may suggests a customizable color scheme consistent with Manchester United team colors, or embed the Manchester United
logo in the individual's user profile.  While this application has discussed a number of methods of incorporating, or utilizing, media-based profile information, it can be appreciated that there are many other methods of incorporating and utilizing this
data.
<br/><br/> It should also be appreciated that the method 70 of collecting social networking information does not require a social networking system and that a social networking system is only one example where a method of collecting information from
digital media files may be used.  For example, a method similar to method 70 may be used in the field of data forensics to determine the content of a plurality of digital media files.  Similarly, a method similar to method 70 may be implemented as a
standalone software application that may be installed and operated on a private computer to help categorize digital media files.
<br/><br/> The methods and techniques described in this disclosure may be implemented, at least in part, in hardware, software, firmware or any combination thereof.  For example, various aspects of the described techniques may be implemented within one or
more processors, including one or more microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), or any other equivalent integrated or discrete logic circuitry, as well as
any combinations of such components.  The term "processor" may generally refer to any of the foregoing logic circuitry, alone or in combination with other logic circuitry, or any other equivalent circuitry.  A control unit comprising hardware may also
perform one or more of the techniques of this disclosure.
<br/><br/> Such hardware, software, and firmware may be implemented within the same device or within separate devices to support the various operations and functions described in this disclosure.  In addition, any of the described units, modules or
components may be implemented together or separately as discrete but interoperable logic devices.  As noted above, depiction of different features as modules or units is intended to highlight different functional aspects and does not necessarily imply
that such modules or units must be realized by separate hardware or software components.  Rather, functionality associated with one or more modules or units may be performed by separate hardware or software components, or integrated within common or
separate hardware or software components.
<br/><br/> The methods and techniques described in this disclosure may also be embodied or encoded in a non-transitory computer-readable medium, such as a computer-readable storage medium, containing instructions.  Instructions embedded or encoded in a
computer-readable storage medium may cause a programmable processor, or other processor, to perform the method, e.g., when the instructions are executed.  Non-transitory computer readable storage media may include volatile and/or non-volatile memory
forms including, e.g., random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), programmable read only memory (PROM), erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM), electronically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), flash memory, a hard disk, a
CD-ROM, a floppy disk, a cassette, magnetic media, optical media, or other computer readable media.
<br/><br/> Thus, embodiments of the invention are disclosed.  Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain disclosed embodiments, the disclosed embodiments are presented for purposes of illustration and
not limitation and other embodiments of the invention are possible.  One skilled in the art will appreciate that various changes, adaptations, and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended
claims.
