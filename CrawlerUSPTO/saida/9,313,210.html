       <p> Embodiments of the present invention provide a method, system and
     computer program product for the automated suggestion of a privacy level
     setting for a new connection in a social network. In an embodiment of the
     invention, a method for automated suggestions of privacy level settings
     for a new connection in a social network is provided. The method includes
     receiving a new connection for an end user of a social network and
     identifying mutual connections between the new connection and the end
     user. Thereafter, a suggested privacy setting for the new connection can
     be displayed in a display of a computer based upon privacy settings of
     the identified mutual connections. Optionally, a selection can be
     received of a different privacy setting than the suggested privacy
     setting and the different privacy setting can be established for the new
     connection.

         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>We claim: <br/><br/> 1.  A method for automated suggestions of privacy level settings for a new connection in a social network, the method comprising: receiving a new social media connection for an end
user of a social network;  identifying mutual social media connections between the new social media connection and the end user of the social network;  displaying in a display of a computer a suggested social media privacy setting for a selected social
media privacy setting of the new social media connection based upon a comparison of privacy settings already established for individual ones of the identified mutual social media connections to privacy settings for connections of the end user listed in
different privacy level groups;  establishing the suggested social media privacy setting for the selected social media privacy setting of the new social media connection in the social network;  determining if additional social media privacy settings
remain to be processed for the new social media connection;  and, repeating the displaying and establishing for each remaining social media privacy setting for the new social media connection.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving a selection of a different privacy setting than the suggested privacy setting;  and, establishing the different privacy setting for the new connection.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1, wherein the suggested privacy setting for the new connection is based upon a privacy level group assigned to a largest set of the mutual connections.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 1, wherein the suggested privacy setting for the new connection is based upon a privacy level group assigned to a most highly ranked one of the mutual connections.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 1, wherein the suggested privacy setting for the new connection is a value computed as an average of values for privacy settings of the mutual connections.
<br/><br/> 6.  A social networking data processing system configured for automated suggestions of privacy level settings for a new connection, the system comprising: a host server comprising at least one processor and memory and configured for
communicative coupling to a plurality of computing devices over a computer communications network;  a social network hosted by the host server;  and, a privacy level suggestion module coupled to the social network, the module comprising program code
enabled upon execution in memory of a computer to identify mutual social media connections between a new social media connection of an end user of the social network and the end user, to display in a graphical user interface (GUI) for the social network
a suggested privacy setting for a selected social media privacy setting of the new social media connection based upon a comparison of privacy settings already established for individual ones of the identified mutual social media connections to privacy
settings for connections of the end user listed in different privacy level groups, to establish the suggested social media privacy setting for the selected social media privacy setting of the new social media connection in the social network, to
determine if additional social media privacy settings remain to be processed for the new social media connection and to repeat the displaying and establishing for each remaining social media privacy setting for the new social media connection.
<br/><br/> 7.  The system of claim 6, wherein the suggested privacy setting for the new connection is based upon a privacy level group assigned to a largest set of the mutual connections.

<br/><br/> 1.  Field of the Invention
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to the filed of social networking and more particularly to the management of privacy settings for contacts in a social networking.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of the Related Art
<br/><br/> A social network refers to a social structure of nodes each associated with a different person or organization.  The interconnections of each node reflect direct relationships between the respective people and organizations such that the
directness of a relationship between two persons or organizations associated with respective nodes can be summarized by the path of interconnections between the respective nodes.  In this way, any one individual in a social network can evaluate the
number and quality of social relationships with others in the network, those relationships ranging from close familial bonds to casual acquaintances.
<br/><br/> The advent of the global Internet has changed the way in which social networks can be viewed.  Originally, a mere visual tool describing a social phenomenon, computerized social networks facilitate the recognition and expansion of social
networks amongst interacting users across the globe.  Whereas geographic boundaries previously limited the extent and quality of a given social network, the global Internet enables limitless expansion of the social network based upon a vast set of aware
collaborators coupled by the fabric of computer communications.
<br/><br/> Commercial computerized social networks have become wildly popular in recent years--especially amongst the younger demographic.  Examples include the MySpace.TM.  computer socialized network maintained by MySpace, Inc.  of Los Angeles, Calif.,
LinkedIn.TM.  computerized business network maintained by LinkedIn Corporation of Palo Alto, Calif., and the Facebook.TM.  computerized social network maintained by <b><i>Facebook</i></b> of Palo Alto, Calif.  Commercial computerized social networks represent social
networking services connecting users according to different types of interests in an aggregated view--generally a Web site hosting user contributed content through imagery and commentary.
<br/><br/> Commercial computerized social networks allow users to create individual profiles.  Each profile can include social media including imagery such as photographs of the user and things relevant to the user.  Each profile further can include
textual materials such as lifestyle information, or general writings.  Notably, users can establish networks of connection or "friends".  Friends can be specified manually by a given user and often represent the individuals or organizations known
personally by the given user.  Each of the friends can be presented in the Web site so as to allow linking to a corresponding profile for the friend.  In this way, an end user literally can navigate shared connections of connections in the social network
for a given user.
<br/><br/> Currently, social networking applications allow users to create privacy settings that indicate the amount of information that different individuals are privy to access.  Privacy settings can be compared to security settings in that security
settings block access to information excepting for authorized users, while privacy settings limit the degree to which information can be shared with others and can range from no information to all information depending upon a class of a user seeking
access to the information.  Privacy settings, in this regard, can be established for access to photographs, postings, messages, or profile information so that only "friends" or possibly "friends of friends" can view the information, as an example.  Thus,
as it is well-understood in the art, security is a process that can support and enforce privacy, and therefore, privacy is an outcome of an application of security.  It follows then, that a privacy setting is a desired consequence and security measures
can be implemented to achieve a privacy setting.
<br/><br/> At present, when a user adds a new social connection to the social network of the user, the user must manually select privacy settings for application for the new social connection, or the user must manually assign the new social connection to
one of a general set of groups of different privacy levels.  Alternatively, the user can manually edit the privacy settings at a later time.  This forced effort usually results in new social connections being assigned default privacy levels, which may
inadvertently expose the confidential information of the user, or may the new social connection being undesirably constrained defeating the ability of the user to effectively network with new contacts.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the present invention address deficiencies of the art in respect to privacy settings for new connections in a social network and provide a novel and non-obvious method, system and computer program product for the automated
suggestion of a privacy level setting for a new connection in a social network.  In an embodiment of the invention, a method for automated suggestions of privacy level settings for a new connection in a social network is provided.  The method includes
receiving a new connection for an end user of a social network and identifying mutual connections between the new connection and the end user.  Thereafter, a suggested privacy setting for the new connection can be displayed in a display of a computer
based upon privacy settings of the identified mutual connections.  Optionally, a selection can be received of a different privacy setting than the suggested privacy setting and the different privacy setting can be established for the new connection.
<br/><br/> In one aspect of the embodiment, the suggested privacy setting for the new connection is based upon a privacy level group assigned to a largest set of the mutual connections.  In another aspect of the embodiment, the suggested privacy setting
for the new connection is based upon a privacy level group assigned to a most highly ranked one of the mutual connections.  In yet another aspect of the embodiment, the suggested privacy setting for the new connection is a value computed as an average of
values for privacy settings of the mutual connections.
<br/><br/> Additional aspects of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.  The aspects of the invention will be realized and
attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.  It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not
restrictive of the invention, as claimed. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.  The embodiments

<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a pictorial illustration of a process for automated suggestions of privacy level settings for a new connection in a social network;
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of a social networking data processing system configured for automated suggestions of privacy level settings for a new connection; and,
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating a process for automated suggestions of privacy level settings for a new connection in a social network.
<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the invention provide for automated suggestions of privacy level settings for a new connection in a social network.  In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, mutual connections in a social network shared between a new
connection of a social networking user and the social networking user can be identified.  Thereafter, a privacy setting can be computed based upon corresponding privacy settings of the mutual connections.  Finally, the computed privacy setting can be
suggested to the social networking user for application according to security measures to the new connection in a graphical user interface of a client application for the social network.
<br/><br/> In further illustration, FIG. 1 pictorially shows a process for automated suggestions of privacy level settings for a new connection in a social network.  As shown in FIG. 1, a new connection 110 can be added to a social network 100 of an end
user of the social network 100.  Different privacy groups 120 having correspondingly different combinations of privacy settings can be established for the end user of the social network 100.  Each of the privacy groups 120 can have assigned thereto
different social network connections 130, 140 of the end user of the social network 100.  Automated privacy level suggestion logic 150 can compare the social networking connections of the new connection 110 to those of the end user of the social network
100 in order to identify mutual connections 140 shared by the end user of the social network 100 and the new connection 110.
<br/><br/> Subsequently, one of the privacy groups 120 can be suggested for assignment to the new connection 110 based upon a computation of the mutual connections 140, for example one of the privacy groups 120 in which most of the mutual connections 140
have been assigned.  In this regard, the suggestion can be presented graphically within a GUI for a client application accessing the social network 100 with imagery representative of each of the groups 120 and an indication of the social network
connections 130, 140 in each of the groups 120 and also an indication of the mutual connections 140 in each of the groups 1.  The GUI can be additionally enabled to permit the end user of the social network 100 to drag-and-drop an icon representative of
the new connection 110 to a preferred one of the groups 120 in order to effectuate an assignment of the new connection 110 to the preferred one of the groups 120.
<br/><br/> The process described in connection with FIG. 1 can be implemented within a social networking data processing system.  In yet further illustration, FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of a social networking data processing system configured for
automated suggestions of privacy level settings for a new connection.  The system can include a host server 210 with at least one processor and memory configured for communicative coupling to different computing devices 210 over computer communications
network 230.  The host server 210 can support the execution of an operating system 240 that in turn can host the operation of a social network 250 accessed by different social networking end users through different social networking clients 220 of
respectively different computing devices 210.
<br/><br/> A connection data store 260 can be coupled to the social network 250.  The connection data store 260 can store records for different users of the social network 250 and the relationships between the different users such that each of the
different users of the social network 250 can be associated with one or more different connections of the other users of the social network 250.  To manage degrees of access to information posted by the different users of the social network 250, a
privacy level table 270 can be provided storing privacy settings for information provided by the different users of the social network 250.  In particular, the privacy level table 270 (which can be one or several tables in practice, stored centrally with
the social network 250, or stored distributively with the social networking clients 220) can associate privacy settings for each user of the social network 250 with respect to content provided by each user of the social network 250 so as to limit which
if any connections of a user of the social network 250 can view content provided by the user of the social network 250, or provide additional content in association with the user of the social network 250.
<br/><br/> Of note, privacy level suggestion module 300 can be coupled to the social network 250, the privacy level table 270 and the connection data store 260.  The module 300 can include program code enabled upon execution in the memory of the host
server 210 to identify mutual connections between a new connection added to a list of connections for an end user of the social network 250 and the end user of the social network 250.  Based upon the mutual connections, one or more privacy settings can
be suggested to the end user through a GUI for the social network 250 for establishment within the privacy level table 270 for the end user with respect to the new connection.  For example, a privacy setting established for a majority of mutual
connections can be suggested for establishment for the new connection.  Alternatively, where the privacy setting is a numerical value set from a range of values, an average value of the privacy setting for the mutual connections can be computed and
suggested for establishment for the new connection.  As yet another alternative, to the extent that some connections are rated or ranked more highly than others, the privacy setting of the most highly ranked mutual connection can be suggested for
establishment for the new connection.
<br/><br/> In even yet further illustration of the operation of the privacy level suggestion module 300, FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating a process for automated suggestions of privacy level settings for a new connection in a social network.  Beginning
in block 310, a request for a new connection can be received for an end user of a social network.  In decision block 320, it can be determined whether or not the request has been accepted.  If so, in block 340 the new connection can be added to a listing
of connections for the end user and in block 350, one or more mutual connections can be identified for the new connection and the end user.
<br/><br/> In block 360, a first privacy setting can be selected for processing for the new connection.  In block 370, different privacy level groups can be loaded, each group corresponding to a different privacy level and including at least one connection
of the end user.  In block 380, the mutual connections of the new connection can be compared to the connections listed in the different groups.  Thereafter, in block 390 a privacy level group for the new connection can be suggested to the end user, the
suggested privacy level group having the most mutual connections than the other privacy level groups.  In response to the suggestion, the end user can place the new connection in the suggested privacy level group, or in another privacy level group.  In
decision block 400, if additional privacy settings remain to be processed, in block 410 a next privacy setting can be selected for processing and the process can be repeat through block 400.  When no further privacy settings remain to be processed, the
process can end in block 330.
