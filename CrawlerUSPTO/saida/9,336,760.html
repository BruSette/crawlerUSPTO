<br/><br/> The invention relates generally to computer software, and more specifically, to generating musical compositions from image pixels in a computing environment.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Personal media libraries are on the rise.  First, low cost still cameras and video cameras allow users to capture media in almost any venue.  Further, the advent of inexpensive and vast storage resources removes limitations of selectively
capturing and saving media.  Additionally, nearly infinite stores of media are available for download on the Internet from social networking, e-mail and search engine results.  Once a computing or media device is obtained, the cost of building personal
media collections is negligible.
<br/><br/> For example, pre-teenagers often own smart telephones (tablets and other devices) with the ability to take photos on a whim, and thousands of photos can be stored within the small devices.  Many users own several other media capturing devices,
such as tablet computing device, laptops with integrated cameras, digital still cameras, in addition to media downloaded from the web sites on the Internet and e-mailed amongst friends.  All in all, users have large personal media libraries at their
disposal on portable computing devices.
<br/><br/> One way to share media is through social networking such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or Instagram.  Additionally, media can be printed out as photographs or burned onto a DVD.  Multiple photographs can be combined into a standard-shaped collage.  Editing
programs allow digital media to be processed by combining, cropping, correcting, and the like.
<br/><br/> However, none of these techniques allow users to enjoy captured media by generating creative media using captured media as components.  In particular, there is no technique to generate a musical composition from pixels of an image.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
<br/><br/> Methods, computer-readable mediums, and system for generating a musical composition from image pixels are described.  Also, an image can be generated from music.
<br/><br/> To do so, pixel values are mapped to musical elements together for creating the musical compositions.  Additionally, images are formed from pixels generated from musical compositions.  More generally, a computer system creatively generates media
using captured media as a source.  The system also generates collage images in which individual images are pixels for the collage image.  Collages are further generated from text
<br/><br/> Additionally, the algorithms described herein can be executed on low-power devices such as mobile and handheld devices (e.g., smart cell phones, laptops, tablets, etc.).  The techniques can thus process large graphical files locally and with no
or limited off-loading to a remote server.  The results can be shared from the low-power device. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Methods, computer-readable mediums, and system for generating a musical composition from pixels of an image are described.  Also, an image can be generated pixel by pixel, from a musical composition.
<br/><br/> More generally, a computer system creatively generates media using captured media as a source.  Thus, music generation from image pixels, described below, is just one aspect of the system capabilities.  Music generation capabilities can be
implemented independently or in coordination with other media generation capabilities.  In other embodiments, a collage of individual images appears itself to be an image.  The individual images are pixels for the collage image.  Also, a collage can be
generated from text such as ASCII characters.  The following description is intended to be exemplary embodiments for the purpose of illustration and not to limit additional embodiments that would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, in view
of the description.
<br/><br/> Musical compositions, as referred to herein, include any type of music that can be played back on a computing device, including songs, solo instrumentals, band instrumentals, random sounds, and the like.  More specifically, a musical composition
is made up of a string of musical elements derived from image pixels.  Each pixel of a media source can represent, for example, one or more chords, one or more instruments, an adjustment to volume, or the like.  Musical compositions can also be generated
from video, collages, or other media sources.
<br/><br/> I. System to Generate Music from an Image or Collage of Images
<br/><br/> FIG. 1A is a block diagram illustrating a system 100 to generate music from an image or collage of images, according to one embodiment.  The system 100 comprises an image database 110, a media generation engine 120, and a user device 130.  Many
other components can be present in other embodiments, for example, firewalls, access points, controllers, routers, gateways, switches, SDN (software defined networking) controllers, and intrusion detectors, without limitation.
<br/><br/> The image database 110 can be any resource for images used to generate music.  For example, and without limitation, the image database 110 can comprise an online Picasa account, or search results from Google Images.  In some implementations, the
image database 110 stores musical compositions associated with stored images.
<br/><br/> The images can be photographs, online pictures, or animations, for example.  The images can be independent, or a portion of a collage or video stream.  Examples of media file formats include MP3, JPG, GIF, PDF and custom camera formats.  In one
case, the image is scanned into a digital format with a larger file having more pixilation than a smaller file.
<br/><br/> The media generation engine 120 generates musical compositions for images.  In one embodiment, the media generation engine 120 provides a user interface for users to configure musical elements and how they relate to image pixels.  Instruments or
groups of instruments can be selected (e.g., string quartet, symphony, jazz band, etc.).  An instrument can be mapped to a group of pixel values such as mapping a piano to blue colors, and piano chords to different shades of blue.  Likewise, a chord can
be mapped to a color, and instruments to play the chord to different shades of the color.  In another embodiment, music elements can have a default or random assignment.  Example of pixel values for color are hex codes (e.g., #33CC33) and RGB vector
values (e.g., 51, 104, 51 corresponds to hex code #33CC33).  Instrument sounds can be pre-recorded snippets, or computer generated.
<br/><br/> A play speed, play direction and type of instruments are also adjustable by a content creator through one embodiment of the media generation engine 120.  These are merely examples of many design specific settings that are available.  The play
speed allows a tempo to be sped up or slowed down, affecting a mood of the playback.  The play direction dictates how pixels are read from the subject image source.
<br/><br/> The media generation engine 120 generates a musical composition corresponding to the image.  To do so, in one touch embodiment, a template is associated with the image to set music element mappings, genre, instrument types, mood, and the like. 
In a customized embodiment, a sequential order for reading individual pixel values from the source image is determined.  The order can be default or selected by the user.  Many variations are possible, such as row by row, column by column, every other
pixel, spiral from middle to outside perimeter, or any appropriate pattern.
<br/><br/> The media generation engine 120 receives individual pixels in the sequential order.  Each pixel is formed from digital information about color, brightness, intensity, and other characteristics.  Therefore, pixel values can be extracted from an
image file.  Alternatively, pixel values can be estimated from a display of the image on a screen, without the actual image file.
<br/><br/> Next, the media generation engine 120 can match musical elements to individual pixel values based on assignments.  In one embodiment, a histogram of a source image is mapped to musical elements wherein frequency of a certain pixel can indicate
volume for instruments played for that color.  Also, a musical composition can be garneted from the histogram by mapping the aggregate number of a certain pixel colors to musical elements.  A resulting musical composition can be stored for real-time
playback, for sharing, or for playback at a later time.  Certain global characteristics can be set by user or by default, such a volume and playback speed.
<br/><br/> In a different embodiment, the media generation engine 120 analyses pixels of a source image and selects an existing musical composition from an audio collection that most closely matches the analysis results.  For example, a histogram of pixels
can indicate a calm mood with lots of mid-range instruments, so a jazz song with an emphasis on piano tones is selected.
<br/><br/> The media generation engine 120 can be implemented in a single server, across many servers, as a software as a service, hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software.  Example components of the media generation engine 120 are set
forth in more detail below with respect to FIG. 1B.
<br/><br/> The user device 130 can provide a user interface for the music generation architecture.  In one case, an app is downloaded an installed.  The app connects with backend resource on the Internet (e.g., the image database 110 and the media
generation engine 120).  In one case, the entire system 100 to generate music is operated locally from the user device 130.  In another case, a network browser interfaces with the image database 110 and/or the media generation engine 120.  In an
embodiment, the user device 130 includes audio speakers and a display for audio and optionally video playback.  Further, a local media application plays back digital media files.
<br/><br/> The user device 130 can comprise a smart phone, a tablet, a phablet, a PC, a touch screen device, or any appropriate computing device, such as the generic computing device discussed below in association with FIG. 2C
<br/><br/> Network 130 can be one or more of: the Internet, a wide area network, a local area network, any data network, an IEEE 802.11 protocol Wi-Fi network, a 3G or 4G cellular network, a Bluetooth network, or any other appropriate communication
network.  Each of the Image database 110, the media generation engine 120, and the user device 130 is connected to the network 199 for communications.  In some embodiments of the system 100A, the image database 110 and the media generation engine 120
execute in the same physical device.  The components can be located on a common LAN, or spread across a WAN in a cloud-computing configuration.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, users create a gallery with multiple canvases of generated music compositions or generated images, videos or collages, along with source media.  The gallery can store individual canvases can be marked for public viewing or
private viewing.  Images can be uploaded to a gallery, and a template for musical generation associated with the image.  The template can be from another canvas, or from a library of themed templates (e.g., rock, symphony, or electronic dance music).
<br/><br/> In one case, the gallery is part of a larger online community or social networking service that shares canvases for browsing by members or friends (e.g., Pinterest or <b><i>Facebook</i></b>).  Viewers may be allowed to edit or contribute to generated media,
and add a lyrics overlay to musical compositions.  Canvases can also be sold or offered for download from galleries.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1B is a more detailed block diagram of the media generation engine 120, according to an embodiment.  The media generation engine 120 includes a media cache 122, a musical element module 134, a musical composition module 136 and a media
player 138.
<br/><br/> The media cache 122 stores source images used for musical compositions.  The musical element module 134 defines assignments between pixels and musical elements used as a base for musical compositions.  The musical composition module 136 analyzes
an image to determine pixel values for matching to musical elements as assigned.  The media player 138 reads the musical composition to produce audio and optionally video for playback.  Audio playback can be concurrent with display of a source image. 
Also, audio generated from a slide show as a whole can be played back with individual images from the slide show.  A template associated with an image or musical composition can be changed during playback to modify the generated media.

<br/><br/> II.  Method for Generating Music from an Image or Collage
<br/><br/> FIG. 2A is a flow diagram illustrating a method 200A for generating music from an image or collage, according to an embodiment.  A range of potential pixel values is assigned to a range of musical elements (step 210).  Musical compositions are
generated corresponding to pixels of source images (step 220), as described in more detail below in association with FIG. 2B.  Musical compositions corresponding to source images are played (step 230).
<br/><br/> FIG. 2B is a more detailed flow diagram illustrating the step 220 of generating musical compositions corresponding to pixels of source images, according to an embodiment.  A sequential order for reading individual pixel values from a source
image is determined (step 222).  Individual pixel values are received from a source image (step 224).  Musical elements are matched to individual pixels based on assignments (step 226).  Musical compositions are stored from matched musical elements (step
228).
<br/><br/> FIG. 2C is a flow diagram showing the analog process to FIG. 2B, in that a method 200C generates images from music compositions.  A range of potential musical elements are assigned to a range of pixel values (step 211).  Pixels are generated for
images corresponding to musical compositions (step 221).  Generated images corresponding to musical compositions are displayed (step 231).
<br/><br/> When performing the reverse method 200C, one difference is that musical instruments and chords are layered (i.e., played in combination at the same time).  In one embodiment, musical compositions are pixelated by taking samples at a certain
frequency.  An individual sample can then be converted to an image pixel including all instruments and chords playing at that snapshot moment.  In another embodiment, individual instruments are observed over time and pixelated for conversion to pixels. 
Many other embodiments are possible.  In other instances, other musical characteristics such a tempo and volume can be converted to other pixel or image characteristics such as brightness.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 3A-3B show an alternative embodiment for generating music from a source image.  FIG. 3A is a flow diagram illustrating a method 300A for generating collages from images or videos, according to one embodiment.  A collage palette picture
and/or video cover pictures are read (step 301).  A palette of images is arranged in order of, for example, brightness/contrast (step 302).  An empty palette is then created (step 303).  Each of the images, in order, is stored in a palette array after
being set to a desired size (loop 304).  A master image is accessed (step 305) for optimizing and processing (step 306).  The master image can be down sampled in size and quality for smart phones or up sampled in size and quality of a PC device, for
instance.  Also, image filters and effects can be applied (step 307).
<br/><br/> With respect to the loop 304 of FIG. 3A, the loop is dependent upon a size of palette from dark to bright, for example, for palette size of 15.  Variable n represents number of different images for each palette (minimum n=1, maximum n=any number
greater than 1).  If n=2, then the example palette will be an array [15][2] that will have 2 different images for each brightness/contrast level.  In the loop, first an empty palette array [m][n] is created.  Then all of the images are traversed in order
of brightness/contrast and add them to the palette array:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 for (i=0; i&lt;m; ++i) { for (j=0; j&lt;n; ++j) { paletteArray[i][j] = &lt;selected image&gt; } }
<br/><br/> The method 300A continued in FIG. 3B, parameters such as width and height for the master image are retrieved as updated (step 311) used to create an empty collage canvas (step 312).  Various techniques can be used to fill the empty collage
canvas with particular images or videos from the image palette (loop 313).  The collage is saved (step 314) and can be converted to a preferred file format (step 315).  The collage can then be shared or printed (step 316) and shown or annotated (step
317).  To do so, a user selects a particular image in the collage (step 318) to load (step 319).  After annotations and other optional operations for customizing are performed (step 320), the annotation information is saved (step 321).
<br/><br/> In the loop 313 of FIG. 3B, assume the size of original image is w.times.h, and the size of each palette image is s1.times.s2.  An empty Canvas `C` is created of size (w.times.s1).times.(h.times.s2).  For the original picture (w.times.h), each
pixel is traversed (in rows and columns) to get brightness and color information:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00002 for (i=0; i&lt;h; ++i ) { // for each row in the original image for (j=0; j&lt;w; ++j) { // for each col in the current row pixelInformation = for pixel[i][j] // based on pixel brightness/color information, pick the image from
palletArray and place it on the canvas `C` at location [i x s1, j x s2] } }
<br/><br/> The collage canvas can be saved locally or on a server in any appropriate format (e.g., PNG, JPG, PDF or GIF).  Next, the collage canvas can be shared, printed, or otherwise distributed.  Individual images can be annotated, including separate
instances of the same image.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3C is a flow diagram illustrating a method 300C for generating music from an image or collage, according to one embodiment.  The method 300C can be implemented by a smart phone, a tablet, a phablet, a PC, or any appropriate computing
device, such as the generic computing device discussed below in association with FIG. 2C.
<br/><br/> As discussed above, a master image is loaded (step 330) for optimizing and processing (step 331).  The musical settings are retrieved (step 335).  A play list array is generated and traversed until all pixels are read (loop 336).  Each pixel can
represent, for example, a chord or set of chords, one or more instrument, a song, or the like.  Pixels can also represent speed, volume, and other characteristics of music.  Palette images of a collage can also be used in the same described manner as
pixels to generate music.  In one embodiment, a database maps pixel characteristics to music characteristics.  Finally, audio is composed or recorded (step 337) for playback, storing or sharing (step 338).
<br/><br/> III.  Methods for Generating Collages
<br/><br/> FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate exemplary collages 400A and 400B generated from palette images, according to one embodiment.  A master image 410 is composed of multiple palette images, a section of which is shown in detail 411.  The master image 410,
as referred to herein, can be selected by a user to be utilized as a template for applying palette images.  The palette images, as referred to herein, are one or more captured images utilized as individual pixels for generating the master image.  In one
embodiment, the master image 410 and one of the palette images can be the same captured image.  FIG. 4A shows a happy child face as a master image 410 and the same happy child face, along with a mother, father and aunt as palette images.  FIG. 4B shows a
Nike swoosh and the text Just Do It as a master image 420 and various pictures of Nike shoes as palette images, a section of which is shown in detail 421.
<br/><br/> A master image can be printed as a poster or other analog image, or be shared digitally.  In one embodiment, a digital master image has controls such as zoom, pan and rotate.  For example, the master image can be shared on <b><i>Facebook</i></b> as a single
image.  The master image and palette images can be selected from an online <b><i>Facebook</i></b> gallery or locally from a smart phone physical memory.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5A is a flow diagram illustrating a method 500A for selecting a main image for a collage, according to one embodiment.  An image can be sourced from an existing database or captured in real-time for selection.  In some embodiments, a
picture album or other interface to a collection of pictures is accessed.  A user scrolls through to find a desired image for use.  In some embodiments, an image is captured from a camera device on a cell phone or other device in real-time and imported
into the application.
<br/><br/> A selected image can be edited to optimize for its intended use.  An internal or external application applies various types of processing to the image.  For example, the image can be cropped, zoomed in or out, adjusted for color, tint, hue,
saturation, brightness/contrast, and the like.
<br/><br/> If the user is satisfied with the image, the main image is committed for the collage (step 502).  Otherwise, the image is closed and the process repeats until a satisfactory image is selected (loop 501).
<br/><br/> FIG. 5B is a flow diagram illustrating a method 500B for selecting collage palette images for a collage, according to one embodiment.  Images can be sourced from, for example, an album, captured in real-time from a camera device or downloaded
from an online source.  Various palette images can be pulled from different sources.
<br/><br/> Selected images may be required to meet certain uniform constraints with respect to size, shape, color, or other characteristics.  Edits can be applied automatically or manually to meet the constraints.  At any point, additional images can be
added or deleted from the palette (altogether loop 511).
<br/><br/> FIG. 5C is a flow diagram illustrating a method 500C for selecting an iPiXiFi message, according to one embodiment.  The message can be predefined online or from a local database.  Alternatively, the message can be user defined as entered by a
keyboard, voice recognition, or the like.  Pre-formatting may be necessary for special characters, such as filling in a space with a colon.  The message is saved and can be modified, deleted or replaced at any point.  More specifically, user picks an
image to be pixified.  User picks (or create custom) message (e.g., Happy Birthday Joe).  The pixified image is created using message text by changing character font color, size, font-face/type (altogether loop 521).
<br/><br/> FIG. 5D is a flow diagram illustrating a method 500D for selecting collage palette videos, according to one embodiment.  Video clips are sourced from an album, recorded in real-time from a camera device, or downloaded form an online resource.  A
master image, or cover image, is selected from a single frame or still, or as otherwise selected by a user from a separate source.  Video clips and cover images can be edited automatically or manually before the collage is generated.  Video clips can be
added, deleted or modified at any time (altogether loop 531).
<br/><br/> FIG. 5E is a flow diagram illustrating a method 500E for generating collages from text, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> A master image (text image or non-text image) is read (step 540), optimized (step 541), processed (step 542) and sized as discussed above.  Font type faces are loaded using the preconfigured message (step 543).  A message text is loaded (step
544) and characters initialized (step 545).  The source image size is updated (step 546) and then an empty collage canvas is generated (step 547) and filled with, for example, ASCII characters (loop 548).  The collage is stored (step 549) and converted
to an appropriate format (step 550) for sharing (step 551).
<br/><br/> This description of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.  It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form described, and many modifications and variations are
possible in light of the teaching above.  The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical applications.  This description will enable others skilled in the art to best utilize and
