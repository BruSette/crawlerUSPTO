       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A compact polarization beam splitter is formed by cascading two stages of
     directional couplers each containing two waveguides laid in parallel with
     a coupling gap. Each waveguide is made by silicon nitride material having
     a minimum length configured to be comparable with a coupling length for a
     TE polarization mode being set as twice of a coupling length for a TM
     polarization mode. A first-stage direction coupler is optimized by making
     the coupling gap smaller/greater than a nominal value to maximize TE/TM
     extinction ratio at least for a shorter/longer wavelength window of a
     designated wavelength band and each of two second-stage directional
     couplers is optimized by making the coupling gap greater/smaller than the
     nominal value to maximize TE/TM extinction ratio at least for a
     complementary longer/shorter wavelength window of the same designated
     wavelength band.

<br/><br/> The present invention relates to a broadband communication device.  More particularly, the present invention provides a broadband silicon nitride polarization beam splitter with low loss and high extinction ratio for entire C-band.
<br/><br/> Over the last few decades, the use of broadband communication networks exploded.  In the early days Internet, popular applications were limited to emails, bulletin board, and mostly informational and text-based web page surfing, and the amount
of data transferred was usually relatively small.  Today, Internet and mobile applications demand a huge amount of bandwidth for transferring photo, video, music, and other multimedia files.  For example, a social network like <b><i>Facebook</i></b> processes more
than 500 TB of data daily.  With such high demands on data and data transfer, existing data communication systems need to be improved to address these needs.
<br/><br/> As an important integrated optics device, a compact polarization beam splitter (PBS) can be used to achieve polarization independent operation of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and linear optical quantum information technology.  A perfect
PBS should simultaneously have short device length, high extinction ratios, low insertion loss, broadband operation, stability, simple structure and high fabrication tolerances.  The state-of-art designs for the PBS are mostly based on asymmetrical
Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), single directional coupler, Multimode interferometer (MMI), or surface plasmons waveguide.  Although immense amount of concrete researches have been done, few perfect PBS has been reported and most of the designs
mentioned above are either low in extinction ratio, difficult to manufacture, or wavelength-sensitive in C-band.
<br/><br/> Therefore, it is desired to develop improved polarization beam splitter with high extinction ratio and low insertion loss over broad communication band.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to photonic broadband communication device.  More particularly, the present invention provides a broadband polarization beams splitter (PBS) based on silicon nitride waveguide.  Merely by example, the present
invention discloses a compact PBS using two-stage directional coupler with wider waveguides and complimentary designed gaps for achieving high extinction ratio and low insertion loss for integration in photonic integrated circuits (PIC) over C-band,
though other applications are possible.
<br/><br/> In modern electrical interconnect systems, high-speed serial links have replaced parallel data buses, and serial link speed is rapidly increasing due to the evolution of CMOS technology.  Internet bandwidth doubles almost every two years
following Moore's Law.  But Moore's Law is coming to an end in the next decade.  Standard CMOS silicon transistors will stop scaling around 5 nm.  And the internet bandwidth increasing due to process scaling will plateau.  But Internet and mobile
applications continuously demand a huge amount of bandwidth for transferring photo, video, music, and other multimedia files.  This disclosure describes techniques and methods to improve the communication bandwidth beyond Moore's law.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the present invention provides a polarization beam splitter.  The polarization beam splitter includes a first-stage directional coupler comprising a first waveguide and a second waveguide laid in parallel with a first coupling
gap and configured to have a coupling length for TE polarization mode be twice of that for TM polarization mode.  The first waveguide is configured with an input port for receiving an optical signal over a predetermined wavelength band and a first
through port for outputting a first primary TM mode portion of the optical signal with a first TM extinction ratio.  The second waveguide is configured to have a first cross port for outputting a first primary TE mode portion of the optical signal cross
coupled from the input port of the first waveguide with a first TE extinction ratio.  The polarization beam splitter further includes a couple of second-stage directional couplers each being configured substantially same as the first-stage directional
coupler except being complementary designed with a second coupling gap.  A first second-stage directional coupler is cascaded to the first through port for further coupling the first primary TM mode portion to a second primary TM mode portion at a second
through port with a second TM extinction ratio and a second second-stage directional coupler being cascaded to the first cross port for further cross-coupling the first primary TE mode portion to a second primary TE mode portion at a second cross port
with a second TE extinction ratio.  The first and second coupling gap are set complementary for maximizing the first and second TE/TM extinction ratio respectively within a shorter and longer wavelength window of the predetermined wavelength band or vise
versa.
<br/><br/> In an alternative embodiment, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing a compact polarization beam splitter.  The method includes forming a first-stage directional coupler comprising two waveguides in parallel separated by a
first gap.  One of the two waveguides includes an input port and a first through output port.  Another one of the two waveguides includes a first cross output port sided with the first through output port.  Additionally, the method includes configuring
each of the two waveguides such that a coupling length for a TE mode of an optical signal of any wavelength selected from a predetermined wavelength band received at the input port is twice of a coupling length for a TM mode of the optical signal.  The
method further includes setting the first gap to maximize transmission of a TE mode portion of the optical signal at the first cross output port and a TM mode portion at the first through output port at least within a shorter wavelength window of the
predetermined wavelength band.  Furthermore, the method includes forming a pair of second-stage directional couplers.  Each contains two waveguides in parallel separated by a second gap and is configured to be substantially the same as the first-stage
directional coupler.  The method further includes cascading a first one of the pair of second-stage directional couplers to the first through output port for further coupling the TM mode portion to a second through output port and cascading a second one
of the pair of second-stage directional couplers to the first cross output port for further coupling the TE mode portion to a second cross output port.  Moreover, the method includes setting the second gap to be greater or smaller than the first gap to
maximize transmission of the TE mode portion at the second cross output port and the TM mode portion at the second through output port at least within a longer wavelength window or a complementary shorter wavelength window of the predetermined wavelength
band.
<br/><br/> In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a compact polarization beam splitter.  The polarization beam splitter includes a first directional coupler comprising two waveguides in parallel separated by a first gap and configured to
split an optical signal of a wavelength band received by an input port of one waveguide with a TE polarization mode portion being substantially cross-coupled once to a first cross output port of another waveguide while a TM polarization mode portion
being substantially cross-coupled twice back to a first through output port of the same waveguide.  Additionally, the polarization beam splitter includes a second directional coupler and a third directional coupler respectively cascaded to the first
cross output port and the first through output port of the first directional coupler.  Each of the second and third directional couplers includes two waveguides in parallel separated by a second gap greater than the first gap and configured to split TE
and TM polarization mode the same way as the first directional coupler for further cross-coupling the TE polarization mode portion once to a second cross output port of the second directional coupler and cross-coupling the TM polarization mode portion
twice to a second through output port of the third directional coupler.  The first gap is set to maximize transmission of the TE/TM polarization mode portion respectively at the first cross/through output port at least over a shorter or longer wavelength
window of the wavelength band and the second gap is set to maximize transmission of the TE/TM polarization mode portion respectively at the second cross/through output port at least over a complementary longer or shorter wavelength window of the
wavelength band.
<br/><br/> Many benefits of polarization beam splitting can be achieved with the present invention based on the waveguide-based directional couplers.  Using SiN waveguide made by CMOS technology based on SOI wafer to replace typical Si waveguide provides a
wider bandwidth with relaxed processing tolerance in selecting width or length.  The directional coupler made with wider waveguide for both arms provides improved polarization splitting extinction ratio (ER) while allowing shorter length to the waveguide
accordingly.  With a shorter length in each directional coupler, a simple yet robust design of a compact PBS is made by cascading two-stage directional couplers with total length comparable to other state-of-art PBS.  Additionally, by adjusting the gap
distance between two arms of each directional coupler in each stage, the pass-band of PBS can be optimized flexibly for lower C-band in first-stage or upper C-band in second-stage so that a widened overall bandwidth with improved ER&gt;25 dB is achieved
on SOI integrated PIC systems.
<br/><br/> The present invention achieves these benefits and others in the context of known polarization beam splitting technology.  However, a further understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention may be realized by reference to the

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to photonic broadband communication device.  More particularly, the present invention provides a broadband polarization beams splitter (PBS) based on silicon nitride waveguide.  Merely by example, the present
invention discloses a compact PBS using two-stage directional coupler with wider waveguides and complimentary designed gaps for achieving high extinction ratio and low insertion loss for integration in photonic integrated circuits (PIC) over C-band,
though other applications are possible.
<br/><br/> Waveguide based polarization beam splitter (PBS) is one of the essential photonic devices in coherent optical communication systems, sensing, optical signal processing, planar lightwave circuits, and other areas whenever a single-polarization
operation or the polarization diversity is required.  There has been a variety of designs/implementations of integrated optic polarization splitters in the literature, among which the directional coupler (DC) may be the most commonly used platform
because of its easy design.  For example, a conventional DC structure using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides can be made as small as less than 10 .mu.m in length and 0.2 to 0.4 .mu.m in width and thickness.  In principle, polarization splitting is
achieved by utilizing the modal birefringence inherent in optical waveguides.  In the conventional design, TE (transverse electric) polarization has a much longer coupling length than TM (transverse magnetic) polarization so that TE polarization goes
through with very slight coupling while TM polarization is cross-coupled completely.  However, the slight evanescent coupling for TE polarization prevents to achieve a high extinction ratio.  Besides, the bandwidth of the PBS based on a single-stage
Si-waveguide directional coupler is not sufficient for covering entire C-band.
<br/><br/> The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and to incorporate it in the context of particular applications.  Various modifications, as well as a variety of uses in different

<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a simplified diagram of a silicon nitride waveguide-based directional coupler according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of
ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown, a directional coupler 100 is formed with two planar waveguide branches 101 and 102 disposed in parallel near each other separated by a gap distance G.
Each waveguide branch 101 or 102 is made by a length L and width W (and thickness not explicitly shown) of silicon nitride (Si.sub.3N.sub.4) material with high refractive index of about 2.0, from which a coupling length of either a TE or TM polarization
mode can be determined.  The waveguide branch 101 includes an input port 121 and a first output port 127, both being made respectively by silicon nitride planar waveguides with a smaller width coupled to the branch 101 by a taper section 111.  The other
waveguide branch 102 includes a coupled port 122 and a second output port 128, both also being made respectively by silicon nitride planar waveguides with a smaller width coupled to the branch 102 by another taper section 112.  In an embodiment, the
silicon nitride planar waveguide is a segment of silicon nitride thick film having a length L and a width W.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the input port 121 is configured to receive an optical signal including mixed TE and TM polarization modes over an operation band of frequencies, for example, the whole C-band.  The optical signal is then fed from the input
waveguide with a narrower width through the taper section 111 into a first end of the waveguide branch 101.  In a specific embodiment, each waveguide branch 101 and 102 is configured to set its length L to be comparable with a coupling length for the TE
polarization mode in the optical signal which is 2.times.  of the coupling length for the TM polarization mode.  This configuration allows separation of the TE and TM polarization modes of the input optical signal as the TE mode after just traveling the
length L (of the two waveguide branches) is substantially cross-coupled completely from the waveguide branch 101 to the nearby waveguide branch 102 and exits at Output2 port 128.  At the same time, the TM mode after traveling the length L will be
cross-coupled completely twice from branch 101 to 102 then back to 101, so TM mode substantially exits at the through port, Output1 port 127.  Thus in principle, the directional coupler 100 according to an embodiment of the present invention is
configured to set its coupling length for splitting an input optical signal in one of frequency in C-band with mixed TE and TM polarizations to two single-mode outputs, one output at a cross port (Output2) 128 bearing substantially TE polarization mode
with a TE extinction ratio and another output at a through port (Output1) 127 bearing substantially TM polarization mode with a TM extinction ratio.  Both TE and TM mode extinction ratio can be as high as 20 dB.  Of course, the mode coupling is 100%
complete so that the through port (Output1) 127 may still contain a minor portion of TE mode while the cross port (Output2) 128 may contain a minor portion of TM mode.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the frequency response of TE/TM coupling of the directional coupler 100 may not be completely uniform across the whole C-band as the coupling length is a function of wavelength.  As the result, the TE/TM mode extinction ratio (ER)
varies with the different wavelengths in the C-band.  For example, the ER may be as high as 30 dB in a smaller window of C-band near 1535 nm and drops to below 15 dB for other wavelengths in a wider range of C-band.  On the other hand, the coupling
length of the directional coupler 100 is also a function of coupling gap G between the two parallel waveguide branches 101 and 102.  For the directional coupler (DC) structure with simple straight waveguide branches, even and odd DC super mode effective
indices (n.sub.even and n.sub.odd) for both TE and TM polarization modes can be calculated at varying coupling gaps G and waveguide widths W. By varying the coupling gap G, the frequency response of TE/TM coupling can be adjusted.  In a specific
embodiment, a nominal value of the coupling gap is selected around 0.5 .mu.m and the waveguide width is selected to be 1.6 .mu.m or greater.  Accordingly, the waveguide length L of the directional coupler 100 configured for operation in C-band is about
145 .mu.m or smaller while the input/output port waveguide and the taper sections can be made in much shorter lengths.  More detail descriptions about the polarization mode splitting over complete C-band being affected by the coupling gap of the two DC
waveguide branches will be seen throughout the specification and particularly below.  Alternatively, the present invention is applicable to be best fit for other frequency band such as L-band or S-band by re-adjusting the waveguide length and width as
well as the coupling gap between two branches.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a simplified diagram of a polarization beam splitter (PBS) by cascading two stages of silicon nitride waveguide-based directional couplers according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which
should not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown, the PBS 200 is formed by cascading two stages of directional couplers that are similarly
configured to the directional coupler 100 shown in FIG. 1 but with complementary design in coupling gap selection for respectively optimizing polarization splitting in two stages with enhanced ER in broader window of wavelength band.  In particular, the
PBS 200 includes one first-stage directional coupler 100A and two second-stage directional couplers 100B and 100C having respective input ports connected to two output ports of the first-stage directional coupler 100A.
<br/><br/> In a specific embodiment, the first-stage directional coupler 100A is associated with a first coupling gap G1 and the two second-stage directional couplers 100B and 100C are configured to be substantially the same as the first-stage directional
coupler 100A but associated with a coupling gap G2.  The first coupling gap G1 is configured to be smaller or greater than the second coupling gap G2 such that the first-stage directional coupler 100A is optimized on polarization splitting with a first
stage high TE or TM extinction ratio (ER) of &gt;20 dB substantially over a lower or upper range of C-band while each of the second-stage directional couplers 100B and 100C is complementary optimized on polarization splitting with an additional second
stage high TE or TM ER of &gt;20 dB substantially over an upper or lower range of the C-band.
<br/><br/> In another specific embodiment, the ER wavelength-dependency optimization for the first/second-stage directional couplers is performed by respectively tuning the coupling gap G1/G2 around a nominal value substantially corresponding to an
optimized ER at middle point of the C-band.  A narrower coupling gap (e.g. a G1 value smaller than the nominal value) results in a shorter wavelength window of high-ER polarization splitting.  A wider coupling gap (e.g., a greater G2 than the nominal
value) results in a longer wavelength window with high-ER polarization splitting.  In the embodiment for operating the PBS 200 in C-band, the nominal value for the coupling gap is about 0.5 .mu.m associated a maximum ER value at a middle wavelength of
C-band.  Then, a complimentary design of the two-stage directional couplers is to set the first coupling gap G1 to be &lt;0.5 .mu.m and the second coupling gap G2 to be &gt;0.5 .mu.m or vise versa.  Since all waveguides of the directional couplers in the
cascaded PBS 200 are made by Si.sub.3N.sub.4 material with much higher refraction index than SiO.sub.2 substrate, the coupling gap G1 or G2 is less sensitive to affect the coupling length for optimizing the high-ER wavelength window.  Thus cascading
two-stage DCs actually have fairly large manufacturing tolerance.  This makes the process for making the compact PBS with high extinction ratio very robust for integration PIC in C-band.
<br/><br/> Referring again to the FIG. 2, as configured similarly as the directional coupler 100, the first-stage directional coupler 100A allows an incoming optical signal with mixed TE and TM mode over the whole C-band received at input port 221 to be
split to two parts based on the TE and TM polarization modes due to a proper design of making a coupling length for TE mode signal 2X of a coupling length for TM mode.  Thus, one part with primarily TE mode and minor TM mode is coupled to a first cross
port 224 of a different branch and another part with primarily TM mode and minor TE mode is coupled (or cross-coupled twice) in the a first through port 223 of the same branch as the input port 221.
<br/><br/> Additionally, each of the second-stage directional coupler (DC) 100B is configured substantially similar as the first-stage directional coupler 100A.  The output signal of the first-stage directional coupler 100A with primary TM mode at a
through port 223 with a first-stage TM extinction ratio becomes an input of a first second-stage directional coupler 100B through which the TM mode is substantially coupled to a corresponding second through port 227 with an additional second-stage TM
extinction ratio.  The minor TE mode in port 223 is substantially coupled to a cross port 228 of DC 100B.  The output signal of the first-stage directional coupler 100A with primary TE mode at a first cross port 224 with a first-stage TE extinction ratio
becomes an input of a second second-stage directional coupler (DC) 100C through which the TE mode is further substantially cross-coupled to a second cross port 230 with an additional second-stage TE extinction ratio.  The minor TM mode is substantially
dropped to a through port 229 of DC 100C.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is an exemplary plot of normalized transmission measured on a first-stage directional coupler in the PBS of FIG. 2 according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the
scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  Provided a first-stage directional coupler (100A) with an optimized coupling gap G1, a normalized transmission is measured and
plotted against wavelengths across entire C-band.  As shown, the transmission power loss for the signal bearing TE polarization mode is very small (&lt;1 dB) at a cross port but quite large at a through port varied in a range from about 25 dB in a
shorter wavelength window of 1530-1535 nm to about 15 dB in a longer wavelength window of 1550-1565 nm.  Effectively this yields a first-stage TE extinction ratio varied similarly across the C-band.
<br/><br/> At the same time, the transmission power loss for the signal bearing TM polarization mode is very small (&lt;1 dB) at the through port 223 but quite large at the cross port 224 varied in a range from about 25 dB in a shorter wavelength window of
1530-1535 nm to about 12 dB or smaller in a longer wavelength window of 1550-1565 nm.  Effectively, this yields a first-stage TM extinction ratio varied as described across the C-band.  In other words, referring to FIG. 2, the TE mode portion of the
optical signal received at the input port 221 is substantially coupled to the cross port 224 and the TM mode portion of the optical signal is substantially coupled to the through port 223 and the splitting of originally mixed TE and TM modes is achieved
by the first-stage directional coupler 100A with first-stage TE or TM extinction ratio up to 25 dB optimized at least in a lower range of C-band.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is an exemplary plot of normalized transmission measured on a second-stage directional coupler in the PBS of FIG. 2 according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the
scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  Provided a second-stage directional coupler (100B or 100C) with an optimized coupling gap G2, a normalized transmission is measured
and plotted against wavelengths across entire C-band.  As shown, the transmission power loss for a TE polarization mode signal is very small (&lt;1 dB) at a cross port but quite large at a through port varied in a range from about 12 dB-15 dB in a
shorter wavelength window of 1530-1540 nm to about 20 dB in a longer wavelength window of 1550-1565 nm.  This yields a second-stage TE extinction ratio for the C-band.  At the same time, the transmission power loss for a TM polarization mode signal is
very small (&lt;1 dB) at the through port but quite large at the cross port varied in a range from about 11 dB-13 dB in a shorter wavelength window of 1530-1535 nm to about 25 dB in a longer wavelength window of 1550-1557 nm.  Again, a second-stage TM
extinction ratio for the C-band is provided.
<br/><br/> Referring to the second-stage DC 100B in FIG. 2, its input includes primarily TM mode portion and minor TE mode portion from the first through port 223 with high first-stage TM ER optimized in lower range of C-band.  The DC 100B is configured to
further split the primarily TM mode portion and minor TE mode portion by coupling the TM mode to the second through port 227 with a high second-stage TM ER optimized in upper range of C-band while cross-coupling the minor TE mode to the cross port 228 of
DC 100B.  Similarly, referring to the second-stage DC 100C in FIG. 2, its input includes primarily TE mode portion and minor TM mode portion from the first cross port 224 with high first-stage TE ER optimized in lower range of C-band and is further split
by coupling the minor TM mode to the through port 229 of DC 100C and cross-coupling the primary TE mode portion to the second cross port 230 with high second-stage TE ER optimized in upper range of C-band.  In an alternative embodiment, the complementary
design of the two stages of DCs can choose to set the first coupling gap for optimizing the first-stage DC with maximum ER at upper range of C-band while to set the second coupling gap for optimizing the second-stage DC with maximum ER at complementary
lower range of C-band.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is an exemplary plot of normalized transmission measured on the PBS made by cascading two stages of directional couplers (DCs) of FIG. 2 according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This diagram is merely an example, which should
not unduly limit the scope of the claims.  One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.  As shown, when both the first-stage DC 100A and two second-stage DCs 100B and 100C are configured with
complementary coupling gap optimization of high ER wavelength windows respectively for lower and upper range of C-band or vise versa, polarization splitting with a final TE/TM ER of greater than 25 dB is achieved over entire C-band while retaining very
low insertion loss (&lt;2 dB) for either the TE mode signal in the second cross port 230 or the TM mode signal in the second through port 227.
<br/><br/> In principle, a final TE or TM extinction ratio is equal to a sum of a first-stage TE or TM extinction ratio defined by the primary TE mode portion in the first cross port 224 over the minor TE power in the first through port 223, or the primary
TM mode portion in the first through port 223 over the minor TM power in the first cross port 224, and a second-stage TE or TM extinction ratio associated with each second-stage directional coupler.  In certain embodiment of the present invention, the
first-stage extinction ratio is optimized near a lower range of C-band and the second-stage extinction ratio is optimized near an upper range of C-band.  The final extinction ratio of the PBS is more uniformly improved across complete range of C-band.
<br/><br/> Although cascading two stages of DCs with optimized coupling gap increases the total length of the PBS, but the length of each DC plus its input/output waveguide and taper portions is merely about 150 .mu.m, still making this PBS a compact one
but with substantially improved extinction ratio for complete C-band.  Furthermore, the DC used in each stage is made by Si.sub.3N.sub.4 material with high manufacture tolerance in terms of selections of waveguide width and coupling gap at a minimum
waveguide length to obtain a desired coupling length for achieving high TE/TM polarization extinction in desired complementary wavelength windows.  Thus, such cascading process for making a compact broadband PBS with high ER is very robust for
integration PIC at entire C-band.
<br/><br/> In an alternative embodiment, the present invention also provides a method for forming a compact polarization beam splitter.  The method includes making a first-stage directional coupler including two waveguides laid in parallel separated by a
first coupling gap and configured to have a coupling length for TE polarization mode to be twice of a coupling length for TM polarization mode.  The two waveguides are made by silicon nitride material formed on a SOI wafer.  One of the two waveguides
includes an input port for receiving an optical signal selected from a designated wavelength band with mixed TE and TM polarization modes.  The first-stage directional coupler is configured to split the optical signal to two parts.  One part containing
primary TM mode limited by a first-stage TM extinction ratio is passed to a first through output port of the same waveguide connected to the input port.  Another part containing primary TE mode limited by a first-stage TE extinction ratio is
cross-coupled to a first cross port of another one of the two waveguides with the first cross output port being sided with the first through port separated by the first coupling gap.  The method additionally includes tuning the first coupling gap to be
smaller or greater than a nominal value for optimizing the first-stage TE or TM extinction ratio to achieve higher values in a shorter or longer wavelength window of the designated wavelength band.
<br/><br/> The method for forming a compact polarization beam splitter further includes cascading two second-stage directional couplers respectively to two output ports of the first-stage directional coupler.  Each of the two second-stage directional
couplers are also made by silicon nitride material on SOI wafer and configured to be substantially the same as the first-stage directional coupler except that the two waveguides are laid in parallel with a separation of a second coupling gap greater than
the first coupling gap.  In particular, the first through output port of the first-stage directional coupler becomes an input port of a first second-stage directional coupler and the first cross output port of the first-stage directional coupler becomes
another input port of a second second-stage directional coupler.  The first second-stage directional coupler is configured to further couple the TM mode from corresponding input port (i.e., the first through output port) with a second-stage TM extinction
ratio to a second through output port.  The second second-stage directional coupler is configured to further cross-couple the TE mode from corresponding another input port (i.e., the first cross output port) with a second-stage TE extinction ratio to a
second cross output port.
<br/><br/> In a specific embodiment, the formation of the second-stage directional coupler can be performed on the same SOI wafer for forming the first-stage directional coupler.  Cascading the two stages directional couplers is a seamless single process
of forming several integrated Si.sub.3N.sub.4 waveguides on a SOI wafer.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the method for forming a compact polarization beam splitter includes tuning the second coupling gap to be complementary of the first coupling gap.  Therefore, each of the second-stage directional couplers can be optimized to obtain
maximum second-stage TE or TM extinction ratio in a longer or shorter wavelength window of the designated wavelength band that is complementary to the shorter or longer wavelength window optimized for the first-stage directional coupler.  The final
polarization splitting extinction ratio for TE or TM mode is obtained by summing the first-stage extinction ratio and the second-stage extinction ratio over entire range of the designated wavelength band.
<br/><br/> While the above is a full description of the specific embodiments, various modifications, alternative constructions and equivalents may be used.  Therefore, the above description and illustrations should not be taken as limiting the scope of the
present invention which is defined by the appended claims.
