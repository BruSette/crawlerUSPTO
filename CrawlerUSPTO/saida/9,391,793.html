       <p> A system for displaying updated traffic information such as parking,
     detours, road blockage etc. in a given area. The system comprises a
     network of placards connected to a central station. Each placard has a
     unique identification within the network. The central station sends a
     message word to one of more placards and each placard receives and
     propagates the received message word to adjacent placards in the network
     in a point-to-multipoint configuration. The message word includes an
     encoded traffic message that only the designated placards may decode and
     display. In an embodiment, the encoded message may only be decoded using
     the unique identification of the designated placards.

the received message words and display the traffic messages on the electronic display;  decode any message word sent by the remote controller regardless of the unique identifier of each electronic placard. <hr/> <center><b><i>Description</i></b></center>
<hr/> <br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> (a) Field
<br/><br/> The subject matter disclosed generally relates to an electronic placard for providing updated information to the public.
<br/><br/> (b) Related Prior Art
<br/><br/> Traffic placards are usually provided at an elevated position e.g., secured to light polls or walls, to be seen by pedestrians and drivers.  Traffic placards usually indicate local traffic rules for a certain area, street or a portion of a
street.  Examples of conventional traffic placards are shown in FIGS. 1a and 1b.
<br/><br/> These placards often include confusing information when it comes to parking and speed.  For example, in school areas the placards may indicate that the speed is 40 km/h from Monday and Friday between 7 AM and 4 PM, and 80 KM/H outside of these
times.  This information is confusing and takes time to read, analyze and process especially when someone is driving.
<br/><br/> Some placards may indicate that parking is not permitted in a specific time frame of the day between December and April for snow removal operations.  However, sometimes it snows earlier than December and/or later than April.  In which case, it
would not be possible to clean the sidewalks due to the presence of parked cars.  In other times, there may not be snow for a long period, but yet drivers may be prohibited from parking to not be ticketed.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, depending on snow precipitations, snow removal operations may be performed according to schedules which are determined on a daily basis.  Therefore, parking may be prohibited in certain areas during given periods whereas parking is
normally allowed in such areas during such given periods.  In such cases, temporary traffic placards as shown in FIGS. 1c &amp; 1d are used.  Such temporary traffic placards must be produced, and manually installed and removed each time such snow removal
operations take place.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, there is a need in the market for electronic placards which may be controlled centrally to display up-to-date traffic information.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> A system for displaying updated traffic information such as parking, detours, road blockage etc. in a given area.  The system comprises a network of placards connected to a central station.  Each placard has a unique identification within the
network.  The central station sends a message word to one of more placards and each placard receives and propagates the received message word to adjacent placards in the network in a point-to-multipoint configuration.  The message word includes an
encoded traffic message that only the designated placards may decode and display.  In an embodiment, the encoded message may only be decoded using the unique identification of the designated placards.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an image of an electronic placard in accordance with an embodiment.  As shown in FIG. 2, the electronic placard 10 comprises a chassis 12 and a display 14 for displaying up-to-date traffic messages to the public.  In the
example of FIG. 2, the message indicates that parking is prohibited due to snow removal.  The chassis may also include a logo/trademark/sign 16 of the city in which the placard 10 is used to indicate that the placard 10 displays official traffic
information.  Traffic information is provided to the placard 10 from a central location as will be described in further detail hereinbelow.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the placard 10 may include two displays for displaying identical or different traffic information on the different displays 14.  Assuming that the electronic placard 10 is used in a one-way street, the placard 10 may display
the one-way sign on one display and the wrong-way sign on the opposite display to alert drivers in the opposite direction they are going the wrong way.  According to another embodiment, a placard 10 may divided in two functional halves on the same
display 14 or two displays may be integrated on the same side of the electronic placard 10.  Each display (or half) may be controlled individually.  One may be a simple on/off display with a "Parking" or "No Parking" sign and the other may be a dynamic
display showing the time of day or other dynamic information.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an example of an electronic placard 10 secured to a light pole 18 using attachments 20, in a non-limiting exemplary implementation.  The placard 10 may be provided in a portable size and may include a chassis comprising an
attachment 20 in the form of a circular clamp for clamping on a pole 18.  In a non-limiting example of implementation the placard 10 may have dimensions that are similar to those illustrated in FIG. 3.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the electronic placards 10 are provided in different locations of the city/street and connected in the form of a mesh network.  In an embodiment, each placard 10 receives the traffic information and propagates it to other
adjacent placards 10 within the network in a point-to-multipoint configuration, as exemplified in FIG. 4.  One of the advantages of such configuration is that if one link breaks or one placard 10 is damaged, the information can still make its way to the
designated placard(s) through other placards 10 within the network.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 4, the traffic information may be provided to one or more electronic placards from a central station 22 e.g., a computer, server or the like.  The station 22 may be connected to one or more placards 10 over a communication link
24 e.g. any type of wired and/or wireless link (RF, cellular, Bluetooth, Infrared, etc.).  In one embodiment, the central station 22 may be accessed remotely over another communication network such as the internet, or a wireless network whereby users may
access the station 22 to send traffic information to the placards 10 from their cellular phones or computing devices from any location in the world.
<br/><br/> According to another embodiment, the traffic information may be provided to one or more electronic placards from a roaming and/or portable station/device which may be installed within a vehicle which travels the streets where the electronic
placards are installed.  The roaming station has a unique ID which makes it easy for the placards 10 to carry out instructions based on the recognition of the roaming station ID.  In the case, where snow removal is involved, the roaming station could be
in the snow removal vehicle.  The electronic placards would simply detect the proximity of the roaming station and update its traffic message based on this detection.  According to an embodiment, the roaming station may be a simple remote keypad (not
shown), also with a unique ID.  The remote keypad can be used to transmit instructions to the placards 10 and thereby controls information being displayed thereon.
<br/><br/> In a non-limiting example of implementation, each placard 10 may have a unique ID within the network, whereby it is possible to send unique messages to selected placards 10.  For example, a map/user interface may be provided at the central
station (or may be accessed remotely over the web) showing the location and identification of each placard 10 in a certain area, as shown in FIG. 5a.  In an embodiment, the placards 10 may be grouped by areas or sub-areas, street names, etc. as shown in
FIG. 5b, whereby it is possible to send a message indicating "no-parking between 6 PM and 7 PM" to placards 10 in group 24a, a message indicating "no-parking between 7 PM and 8 PM" to placards in group 24b, and another indicating "Parking Permitted" to
placards 10 in group 24c.  The interface allows the user to view the placards and select one or more placards and send them a traffic message overriding the previously displayed one.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the placards 10 may include a positioning system such as a GPS for locating them on any map.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the electronic information sent by the central station 22 is encapsulated in a message word 26.  An example of a message word 26 is shown in FIG. 6.  In a non-limiting example of implementation, the message word 26 may include
a portion 26b indicating the message to be displayed on selected placards, a portion 26c including the IDs of one or more placards 10 to which the message is intended, and a portion 26d including a header comprising security information and redundancy
check.  In an embodiment, the portion 26s may include coded information that may only be decoded using the unique IDs of the placards to which the message is intended.
<br/><br/> In a non-limiting example of implementation, the ID (or address) of the destination placard may be used for the encoding/decoding the message word at the head station 22.  For example, the message 26b destined to a given placard 10 may be
encoded such that the message may only be decoded using the ID of the destination placard 10.  Several encoding methods may be used for the encoding.  In another embodiment, it is possible to use methods that allow for sending a message that may be
decoded by more than one designated placards.  For example, if there are four placards A, B, C, and D in a given area and the user wants to send the same message to placards A and C, but not B and D, the message word may be encoded to be decoded by
placards A and C only using the IDs of these placards.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating the main modules of an exemplary electronic placard in accordance with an embodiment.  As shown in FIG. 7, the electronic placard 10 may include an antenna for receiving the information from neighboring
electronic placards 10 or the central station 22, a receiver 30 for analyzing and decoding the signal received from the antenna 28, a controller e.g. processor or microprocessor etc., for analyzing the message word 26 received from the receiver 30 and to
determine whether the message word 26 is intended to the subject placard 10.  The controller may also be configured to repair the message word when possible.  The display 14 is connected to the display 14 for displaying the new message if the message is
intended to the subject placard.  The placard may also include a transmitter 34 for propagating the message word to other placards using the transmitter 36.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the placard 10 may include a light sensor 38 connected to the controller 32 for detecting the intensity of the light and adjusting the intensity of the power in the LEDs of the display 14 accordingly.
<br/><br/> It should be noted that obvious modifications may be done to the configuration shown in FIG. 7.  For example, it is possible to combine or divide some of the components shown in the block diagrams.  For instance, it is possible to use a
transceiver instead of a separate receiver 30 and transmitter 34.  In other instances, it is possible to use the same antenna for transmission and reception etc.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, a short range remote controller 50 (shown in FIG. 8) may be used which allows for changing/overriding the message displayed on a given placard 10 from short distances e.g. 10 to 20 meters or less.  Such remote controller may be
provided in vehicles that perform functions within the network such as for example, vehicles that perform snow removal or the like.  Whereby, the operator of such vehicles may manually display a given message e.g. prohibiting the parking or prolonging
the NO-Parking time until snow has been removed, or changing the NO-Parking message to Parking Permitted if the snow removal is done earlier or the like.
<br/><br/> In the present scenario, the message word sent by the remote controller 50 may be encoded in a manner that gets decoded by any receiving placard regardless of the address of the placard in the network.
<br/><br/> The placard 10 may be adapted to record one of more of: the ID of the remote controller 50, the message displayed, and the time stamps associated with the activities associated with the remote controller and report this back to the head station
22 for record keeping purposes, billing, insurance claims and the like.  For example, such information may be necessary for determining the punctuality of the snow removal, billing, and to determine the parties responsible for damages and accidents
occurring during the snow removal.  In a further embodiment, the placard 10 may be adapted to sense (using a short range sensor/receiver which may be embedded within the receiver module 30) the presence of the remote controller 50 within a short range
and report the ID of that controller 50 back to the head station 22 regardless of whether the controller was used to change the message of that placard 10 or not.
<br/><br/> The placard 10 may be powered using a power source which may include an internal and/or external battery and/or solar panel, and/or may be directly connected to an external power source such as the existing electric current in the pole.  Other
standard power equipments such as a power converter may also be included in the placard 10.  In an embodiment, the placard may be implemented to operate using a wide range of voltages and a wide range of temperatures to not be affected by extreme whether
conditions.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the display 14 may include, an LDC monitor, multicolor LEDs, or any suitable display technology which allows the display 14 to display traffic signs, text, rotating text, icons, symbols, etc. in a continuous, scrolling or
flashing manner (and/off).
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the electronic placard 10 may include a memory 40 and an inner clock 42.  The memory may include statements and instructions for processing by the controller.  The inner clock 42 may be used by the controller 32 for knowing the
time, whereby, the placard 10 may work independently/autonomously as a regular placard until propagated information is received from the central station to switch the placard from autonomous mode to controlled mode.  This is particularly important when
unforeseen events happen, such as construction, accident, special event, changes in the snow removal schedule etc.
<br/><br/> Illustrative Operating Environment
<br/><br/> The embodiments may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment, an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects, and/or a user interface etc. For example, a user interface may be provided at the
central station 22 for selecting one or more placards 10 and sending a traffic message thereto.  Furthermore, the central station 22 may be operably connected to one or more servers locally or in the cloud for storing information received from the
individual placards.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the remote controller device 50 may include a dedicated device and may also be implemented using a mobile device, an IPOD, laptops, desktops, tablets or any computing device having sufficient computing and/or communication resources
to implement the embodiments.
