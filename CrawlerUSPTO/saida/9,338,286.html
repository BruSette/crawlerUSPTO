<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A machine-implemented method, comprising: receiving caller attribute parameters of a first user, wherein the caller attribute parameters specify information to be
presented to the first user when another user initiates a call to the first user;  searching one or more computer accessible information sources for information regarding a second user;  filtering the information regarding the second user based on the
caller attribute parameters of the first user;  receiving location information from a communication device of the second user when the second user initiates a call to the first user;  determining an authenticity of a communication device of the first
user and an authenticity of the communication device of the second user based on digital signatures received from the respective communication devices;  providing the filtered information to the communication device of the first user when the second user
initiates the call to the first user and discarding the location information, if the communication device of the second user is not authenticated;  and providing the filtered information and the location information to the communication device of the
first user when the second user initiates the call to the first user, if the communication devices of the first and second users are determined to be authentic.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, wherein the searching includes searching for one or more of: an employer of the second user;  an employment title of the second user;  a recommendation of a third user regarding the second user;  a social organization
of which the second user is a member;  a volunteer organization of which the second user is a member;  a professional association of which the second user is a member;  and an educational institution attended by the second user.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1, wherein: the searching includes determining a registered address of the communication device of the second user;  and the providing includes providing the registered address to the communication device of the first
user.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 1, further including: estimating a location of the communication device of the second user based on a geographical location of one or more network devices transited by the call initiated by the second user;  wherein the
providing includes providing the estimated location to the communication device of the first user.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 1, further including: receiving an inquiry from the communication device of the first user asking if location information has been received from the communication device of the second user;  wherein the providing includes
providing the location information to the device of the first user if the location information is received from the device of the second user.
<br/><br/> 6.  An apparatus, comprising, a processor and memory configured to: receive caller attribute parameters of a first user, wherein the caller attribute parameters specify information to be presented to the first user when another user initiates a
call to the first user;  search one or more computer accessible information sources for information regarding a second user;  filter the information regarding the second user based on the caller attribute parameters of the first user;  receive location
information from a communication device of the second user when the second user initiates a call to the first user;  determine an authenticity of a communication device of the first user and an authenticity of the communication device of the second user
based on digital signatures received from the respective communication devices;  provide the filtered information to the communication device of the first user when the second user initiates the call to the first user and discard the location
information, if the communication device of the second user is not authenticated;  and provide the filtered information and the location information to the communication device of the first user when the second user initiates a call to the first user, if
the communication devices of the first and second users are determined to be authentic.
<br/><br/> 7.  The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the processor and memory are further configured to search the one or more computer accessible information sources for one or more of: an employer of the second user;  an employment title of the second user; 
a recommendation of a third user regarding the second user;  a social organization of which the second user is a member;  a volunteer organization of which the second user is a member;  a professional association of which the second user is a member; 
and an educational institution attended by the second user.
<br/><br/> 8.  The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the processor and memory are further configured to: determine a registered address of the communication device of the second user;  and provide the registered address to the communication device of the first
user.
<br/><br/> 9.  The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the processor and memory are further configured to: estimate a location of the communication device of the second user based on a geographical location of one or more network devices transited by the call
initiated by the second user;  and provide the estimated location to the communication device of the first user.
<br/><br/> 10.  The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the processor and memory are further configured to: receive an inquiry from the communication device of the first user asking if location information has been received from the communication device of the
second user;  and provide the location information to the device of the first user if the location information is received from the device of the second user.
<br/><br/> 11.  A non-transitory computer readable medium encoded with a computer program that includes instructions to cause a processor to: receive caller attribute parameters of a first user, wherein the caller attribute parameters specify information
to be presented to the first user when another user initiates a call to the first user;  search one or more computer accessible information sources for information regarding a second user;  filter the information regarding the second user based on the
caller attribute parameters of the first user;  receive location information from a communication device of the second user when the second user initiates a call to the first user;  determine an authenticity of a communication device of the first user
and an authenticity of the communication device of the second user based on digital signatures received from the respective communication devices;  provide the filtered information to the communication device of the first user when the second user
initiates the call to the first user and discard the location information, if the communication device of the second user is not authenticated;  and provide the filtered information and the location information to the communication device of the first
user when the second user initiates a call to the first user, if the communication devices of the first and second users are determined to be authentic.

<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> When a telephone user receives an incoming call, the user knows little about the caller.  Caller ID represents a partial solution, inasmuch as a user can now know the name and/or telephone number of a calling party.  For some users this may be
sufficient.  For other users, e.g., those who receive a large volume of calls and perhaps transact significant business over their telephones, this may not be adequate.
<br/><br/> Some incoming calls are more valuable than others.  Some calls represent potential business or other urgent communications.  Other calls may be important but are less urgent.  Still other calls may have little or no value or significance to the
user.  Some calls in the latter category may even represent nuisances that represent a waste of the user's time and communications bandwidth. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS/FIGURES

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Disclosed herein are methods and systems to display, in real time, attribute information regarding a calling party.  This information may be presented to a user in conjunction with an incoming voice call or message (e.g., instant messaging (IM),
short message service (SMS), or multi-media messaging service (MMS), etc.) on the user'smartphone/mobile internet device (MID) or other mobile device.  Such information can help him/her to decide in real time whether to respond to the communication.  In
currently existing mechanisms and services, only the caller's phone number and/or name (in so-called "caller ID" systems) are displayed.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the displayed attributes may include: caller's location professional information collected from the caller's on-line social/professional networking services (e.g., selected information from a publicly available LinkedIn profile
and/or <b><i>Facebook</i></b> profile) trust relationship between the caller and the receiving party, based on receiver's friends list from social/professional networking services, information about the caller on the receiver's address book, and/or other policies that
may be stored on the Smartphone/MID.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the format and type of information displayed can be configured by the receiving party locally on his/her smartphone or other mobile computing device.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates the components of the system, according to an embodiment.  Note that such a system is not necessarily limited to the illustrated components.  System 100 may include a caller device 110 and a receiver device 120.  As noted
above, these devices may be, for example, smartphones or other mobile internet devices.  The caller device 110 and receiver device 120 may communicate with a server, shown in FIG. 1 as caller attribute processing server (CAPS) 130.  In the embodiment
illustrated, this communication takes place via a network 140.  Network 140 may be any computer network.  In an embodiment, network 140 may be the Internet, or some combination of the Internet, wide area networks, and local area networks.
<br/><br/> Note that the party initiating the communication is referred to herein as the caller, and the communications device used by the caller is referred to herein as a caller device.  Nonetheless it is to be understood that the communication may or
may not be a traditional telephone call.  The communication may be a text or multi-media message, as discussed above.
<br/><br/> The interaction between a caller device, a receiver device, and a CAPS is illustrated generally in FIG. 2 according to an embodiment.  At 210, a caller device may place a call or otherwise initiate communications to a receiver device.  At 220, a
process of compiling the caller's attributes takes place.  As will be described in greater detail below, this compilation may be centered at the CAPS.  The caller device may send information about its geographical location to the CAPS.  The CAPS may also
compile caller information on its own.  Such data may include information about the party associated with the caller device, e.g., the registered owner of the device, presumed to be the caller.  This information may include, for example, the employer of
the caller and/or other professional affiliations.  Such data may be amassed from publicly available sources, such as on-line social networking services for example.  At 230, the compiled attributes of the caller may be communicated to the user of the
receiver device, i.e., the party being called or receiving the message.  The communicated attributes may include the caller's location, his professional affiliations, and/or mutual contacts, for example.
<br/><br/> Note that in an embodiment, the communications between the caller device and the CAPS, as well as communications between the receiver device and the CAPS, take place through a data network such as the Internet for example.  These communications
paths may be separate from the channels that are otherwise used to establish and maintain voice communications between the caller and receiver devices.  In an embodiment, the communications may take place over an out-of-band mechanism, such as SMS for
example.
<br/><br/> An embodiment of the process is illustrated in greater detail in FIG. 3 as process 300.  At 305, the process of compiling the caller device's attributes may be activated.  At 310, a determination may be made at the caller device as to whether
the sharing of its location information is permissible.  Some devices, for example, may be configured to limit or prevent the sharing of information about the device for security reasons.  Such limitations may be viewed abstractly as a security policy. 
At 310, the determination may be made as to whether the sharing of its location information is consistent with its security policy.
<br/><br/> If this sharing is permitted, then at 315, the caller device and the CAPS may engage in an authentication process for security reasons.  This would prevent a hacker or other unauthorized party from posing as the caller.  In an embodiment, a
digital signature may be passed from the caller device to the CAPS.  Such a signature may use a public cryptography algorithm, for example, as would be well known to persons of ordinary skill in the art.  At 315, the CAPS may attempt to verify the
signature.
<br/><br/> If the sharing of location information is permitted at 310 and the caller device is authenticated at 315, then the caller device sends its location information to the CAPS at 320.  The caller device may ascertain its location in a number of
ways.  As discussed above, the location information may be sent via an out-of-band communications mechanism, such as SMS for example.
<br/><br/> If so equipped, the caller device may take advantage of the global positioning system (GPS) in order to determine its location.  Alternatively, the caller device may provide an internet protocol (IP) address for a server or router that it has
used.  Because such an address can be correlated to a geographical location, the IP address can represent an approximation of the physical location of the caller device.  In addition, the location could be determined through a triangulation process
involving known reference points.  The location may also be based on the address registered for the caller device.  This would be the case, for example, if the caller device is a PSTN telephone.
<br/><br/> If either the sharing of location information is not permitted at 310 or the caller device is not authenticated at 315, then the caller device may not send its location information to the CAPS at 320.
<br/><br/> At 325, the CAPS may collect other available information about the caller.  This caller information may include information about the registered owner of the caller device.  This information may include, but is not necessarily limited to, the
person's name, his employer and title, his membership in professional, social, or volunteer organizations, and/or schools attended, for example.  Such information may be obtained from public domain sources, such as profiles published by professional
organizations, or social networking services such as Twitter, LinkedIn, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> or MySpace for example.  The use of social networking services as a source of information may also allow the CAPS to see if a caller is an immediate contact or friend of
the receiving party, or if the caller is a friend of a friend, etc. This would allow the receiving party to see how closely connected the caller might be, and thus would suggest whether there is or should be any sort of trust relationship.  In addition,
the caller information may also be a means of conveying credentials or endorsements in a sales or other business context.  The caller information may include references or recommendations from past contacts of the caller, as could be obtained through
LinkedIn, for example.
<br/><br/> In the illustrated embodiment, this information may have been collected previously and stored at the CAPS in one or more databases (DB) or other accessible data structure(s).  In this case, 325 may represent a search of such a database in the
CAPS.  In an embodiment, data stored at the CAPS regarding the caller may be updated periodically or aperiodically by subsequently searching social networking services and/or other information sources.
<br/><br/> At 330, the receiver device may send a message to the CAPS, inquiring as to whether location information has been received by the CAPS.  If, for example, the security policy of the caller device prohibits the sharing of location information at
310, no location information will have been sent to the CAPS by the caller device.  Likewise, if the authentication of 315 fails, no location information will have been accepted from the caller device by the CAPS.  In an embodiment, the message sent from
the receiver device to the CAPS includes the number of the caller device.
<br/><br/> At 335, an authentication process for the receiver device may take place.  Here, a determination may be made as to whether the receiver device may be an imposter, e.g., a hacker or other unauthorized party.  In an embodiment, a digital signature
may be presented by the receiver device and verification of the signature may be attempted at the CAPS.  If the authentication fails, the process may conclude at 365.  If the authentication succeeds, the process may continue at 340.
<br/><br/> Here, a determination may be made as to whether the location information of the caller device is present at the CAPS.  If so, the process may continue at 345, where the CAPS may construct a caller attributes message (CAM).  In the event that the
security policy of the caller device permits sharing of location information at 310 and the verification of the caller device's signature is successful at 315, the CAM constructed at 345 may include the location information, in addition to the caller
information discussed above.  In the event that the location information of the caller device is not present at the CAPS, then the process continues at 350, where the CAM may be constructed without the location information.
<br/><br/> At 355, the CAM may be sent to the receiver device.  At 360, the contents of the CAM, i.e., the caller information with or without the location information, may be displayed at the receiver device.  The process concludes at 365.
<br/><br/> Note that in an embodiment, the user of the receiver device may also provide input to the CAPS as to the kinds of information that is desired in order to make decisions about whether to accept or reject a call.  A user may specify, for example,
that employer information is not relevant, or that location information is relevant.  This would allow the CAPS to filter the kinds of information that it obtains and/or sends to the user.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the receiver device may also display information about the caller that is stored locally at the receiver device.  Such information could include a stored address book entry.  The presence or absence of an address book entry may
further inform the user of the receiver device as to whether the caller is a trusted party.
<br/><br/> One or more features disclosed herein may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, and combinations thereof, including discrete and integrated circuit logic, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) logic, and microcontrollers, and
may be implemented as part of a domain-specific integrated circuit package, or a combination of integrated circuit packages.  The term software, as used herein, refers to a computer program product including a computer readable medium having computer
program logic stored therein to cause a computer system to perform one or more features and/or combinations of features disclosed herein.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment the functionality of a caller device and a receiver device may be present in a single end user device, such as a smartphone or other mobile internet device for example.  An appropriately configured device may therefore be a
caller device or a receiver device, depending on the situation.  An exemplary embodiment is shown in FIG. 4.  System 400 of this figure illustrates software or firmware modules implemented in conjunction with a programmable device, although such a system
is not necessarily limited to the illustrated modules.  System 400 includes one or more memory devices 410 in communication with a programmable processor 430.  Both memory 410 and processor 430 are in communication with one or more input/output devices
or ports, shown collectively as I/O 420.  In alternative embodiments, such a system is not necessarily limited to these components.
<br/><br/> Memory 410 may include both instructions executable by processor 430, and related data.  Memory 410 may be implemented on a computer readable medium, as would be understood to a person of ordinary skill in the art.  Such a medium may be, for
example and without limitation, a non-volatile memory device, a hard drive, a compact disk that may be read by a compact disk drive, an integrated circuit, or other machine-readable memory device.
<br/><br/> In the illustrated embodiment, executable instructions in memory 410 are shown as computer program logic 440.  The instructions in logic 440 may cause processor 430 to perform one or more functions in response thereto.  Logic 440 may include a
caller attributes initiation (CAI) module 450, a caller attributes policy agent (CAPA) 460, and a caller attributes sender agent (CASA) 465.  These three modules may represent some the functionality described above with respect to a caller device.
<br/><br/> CAI module 450 may be responsible for communicating with the caller attributes processing server at the initiation of a call at 305 in process 300.  This may serve to inform the server that process 300 is to begin.
<br/><br/> CAPA 460 may serve to determine whether the location information of the caller device may be shared with the caller attributes processing server and the receiver device.  In an embodiment, CAPA 460 may compare the parameters of this prospective
information transfer with the conditions specified in the security policy.  The security policy may specify, for example, the acceptable conditions for information transfers, e.g., the information that may be transferred, the parties or entities that may
receive the information, and the conditions under which the transfer may take place, such as the time, the ports to be used, etc.
<br/><br/> CASA 465 may be responsible for sending location information from the caller device to the caller attributes processing server.  As discussed above, this information may have been derived from a GPS, or may take the form of an IP address used by
the caller device.  Known technologies using triangulation may also be used.  The sending of location information is contingent on the permissions defined by the security policy.
<br/><br/> Logic 440 may also include a caller attributes query agent 470, a caller attributes receiver agent 475, and a caller attributes display agent 480.  These three modules may represent some of the functionality described above with respect to a
receiver device.
<br/><br/> The caller attributes query agent 470 may be responsible for contacting the caller attributes processing server upon receipt of an incoming call.  For example, this module may query the call attributes processing server as to whether the
location information of the caller device is present at the server, as discussed above with respect to FIG. 3.
<br/><br/> The caller attributes receiving agent 475 may be responsible for receiving a caller attributes message from the caller attributes processing server.  The caller attributes display agent 480 may then be responsible for then presenting caller
attributes to a user in a particular manner.  The presentation of this information may take place using particular graphics and or audio cues.  In an embodiment, the presentation may be tailored by a user of the receiving device, who may choose to see
certain elements of the caller attributes before other elements, for example, or may choose to see elements of the caller attributes at particular times during the call process.  In an embodiment, the user may configure the number of rings that are heard
before the presentation of the caller attributes.  Configuration of such a presentation may be managed by the caller attributes display agent 480.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the system and processing described here may be used when a caller is contacted by a prospective service provider or other vendor.  Here, it may be useful for the caller to receive information about the service provider's past
work, e.g., recommendations, endorsements, or criticisms from previous customers.  In an embodiment, such information may be collected by the CAPS from publicly available information services such as angieslist.com or servicemagic.com for example.  Such
information may be provided to a receiver device even after a call has been accepted.
<br/><br/> The system and processes described above with respect to the caller attributes processing server may also be embodied in hardware, software, firmware, or in a combination thereof.  An exemplary embodiment is shown in FIG. 5.  System 500 of this
figure illustrates software or firmware modules implemented in conjunction with a programmable device.  System 500 includes one or more memory devices 510 in communication with a programmable processor 530.  Both memory 510 and processor 530 are in
communication with one or more input/output devices or ports, shown collectively as I/O 520.  Note that such a system is not necessarily limited to the components shown.
<br/><br/> Memory 510 may include both instructions executable by processor 530 and related data.  Memory 510 may be implemented on a computer readable medium, as would be understood to a person of ordinary skill in the art.  Such a medium may be, for
example and without limitation, a non-volatile memory device, a hard drive, a compact disk that may be read by a compact disk drive, an integrated circuit, or other machine-readable memory device.
<br/><br/> In the illustrated embodiment, executable instructions in memory 510 are shown as computer program logic 540.  The instructions in logic 540 may cause processor 530 to perform one or more functions in response thereto.  In alternative
embodiments, logic 540 is not necessarily limited to the illustrated modules.
<br/><br/> Logic 540 may include interface modules for communications with the receiver device (module 550) and for communications with the caller device (module 555).  These modules manage communications between the caller attributes processing server and
each of these respective user devices.
<br/><br/> Logic 540 may also include a caller attributes search module 560.  In an embodiment, this module is responsible for identifying the caller information, i.e., attributes of a caller apart from any location information that the caller device may
provide.  As discussed above, this process may include a search of one or more databases at the caller attributes processing server.  The search may be based on the number of the caller device and/or the name of the person associated with the device.
<br/><br/> Logic 540 may also include a caller attributes message (CAM) creation module 565.  This module may be responsible for creation of the caller attributes message, based on information obtained in the search of local databases and any available
location information from the caller device.
<br/><br/> Logic 540 may also include an authentication module 570.  This module may be responsible for authenticating communications with the caller and receiver devices.  In an embodiment, this may include the verification of digital signatures provided
by these devices for security purposes.
<br/><br/> In alternative embodiments, logic 540 is not necessarily limited to the illustrated modules.
<br/><br/> While various embodiments are disclosed herein, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation.  It will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art that various changes in form and detail
may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the methods and systems disclosed herein.  Thus, the breadth and scope of the claims should not be limited by any of the exemplary embodiments disclosed herein.
