<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an embodiment of processing circuitry implemented according to aspects of the present technique.  Processing circuitry 18 comprises analysis module 22, notification module 24 and visualization module 26.  Each
component is described in further detail below.
<br/><br/> Analysis module 22 is configured to receive the social media data from various social media platforms.  The social media data corresponds to input data provided by a data analyst.  In one embodiment, the analysis module is configured to
pre-process the social media data to filter non-relevant data.  Several well known models can be applied such as spam filtering algorithms to remove content not related to the business, "part of speech tagging" to extract language components like nouns,
verbs, adjectives, etc. In addition, stemming operations to normalize of text data and other custom filters like removal of stop words i.e., generic words which do not make any sense during analysis like a, an, the etc., phone numbers, email ids, etc may
also be applied.
<br/><br/> The analysis module 22 is configured to analyze the social media data and generate processed data.  In one embodiment, text analysis models are applied on the social media data.  Examples of text analysis models include text frequency analysis,
sentiment analysis and topic modeling.  Further, the analysis module is configured to access historical data pertinent to the input data while processing the social media data.  Such historical data is stored in memory circuitry 20.
<br/><br/> Further, the analysis module 22 is configured to classify the processed data based on a plurality of criteria.  Examples of such criteria include sentiments, geographic locations, authors, and the like.  In one embodiment, the criteria are
selected by the user.  The criteria may be presented to the user as a drop down menu, check box menu, etc. In one embodiment, the data analyst is provided an option to select more than one criterion for classification.
<br/><br/> Notification module 24 is coupled to the analysis module 24 and is configured to generate a plurality of alerts to one or more users based on the input data.  These alerts are generated based on the input data and the processed data and can be
sent regularly over a selected period of time.
<br/><br/> Visualization module 26 is coupled to the analysis module 22 and is configured to generate a plurality of visual representations of processed data classified based on the plurality of criteria.  The visual representations aid in presenting a
complete picture of the social media data that was retrieved.  These representations allow a data analyst to make informed decisions on a product or a business.  The manner in which social media data is processed and visual representations are generated
are described in further detail below.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating one method by which social media data is processed according to aspects of the present technique.  As described above, social media data refers to data retrieved from social media platforms that exist today. 
In one embodiment, the data is retrieved in real-time.  The process 30 for analyzing social media data is described in further detail below.
<br/><br/> At step 32, social media data is retrieved from one or more social media platforms.  The social media data is retrieved in response to input data provided by a data analyst.  In general, input data may include keywords for a certain product, the
product name, a name of a business or an organization, etc. In one embodiment, social media data includes text strings.
<br/><br/> When the social media data is retrieved, data analysis operations are performed on the social media data.  In the illustrated embodiment, the data analysis operations include text analysis as described in detail below with reference to step 34
and 36.  However, it must be understood to one skilled in the art, that other data analysis operations may also be performed on the social media data.
<br/><br/> At step 34, a text analysis model is applied on the social media data to generate a cluster of text data.  Text analysis models typically structure the social media data, determine specific patterns within the structured data, and evaluate and
interpret the data.  In one embodiment, the social media data is first pre-processed using standard pre-processing algorithms to filter non-relevant data before applying the text analysis model.
<br/><br/> Examples of text analysis models include frequency analysis, sentiment analysis and topic modeling.  In one embodiment, text data frequency analysis is performed on the text data to determine a number of times certain words of interest repeat
within the extracted text data.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, sentiment analysis models are applied on the cluster of text data to generate a sentiment analysis data spectrum.  Sentiment analysis models are used to classify the text data according to one or more sentiments that is
expressed.  In one embodiment, the text data is classified based on a positive sentiment, a neutral sentiment and a negative sentiment.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, topic modeling is performed on the text data.  Topic modeling schemes enable the identification of several themes that are present in the text data.  Further, the topic modeling schemes determine a relative importance of
each word within a topic.
<br/><br/> At step 38, a set of key influencers is determined based on the text data and the sentiment analysis data spectrum.  Typically, an online user's influence is determined by analyzing the online profile of the user.  Key influencers may be persons
whose reputation and influence may impact the business or product.  For example, an author of weblogs or other publications, or a person who comments or participates in online discussions may be considered to have expertise in certain categories or
contexts.  It is often advantageous to understand the manner in which such influencers impact a product or a business.
<br/><br/> At step 40, visual representations are created to illustrate to the data analyst the various results based on the text analysis and the sentiment analysis performed on the social media data.  In one embodiment, the visual representations
comprise trend and distribution charts.  Such charts assist a user in making creating informed and accurate strategies for a product or a business.
<br/><br/> At step 42, alerts and notifications are generated and provided to a plurality of users.  In one embodiment, the alerts are configured to progressively display more information in response to received input data.  In particular, for example, an
alert may initially provide a first level of information or detail about a particular product.  In response to the data analysis steps 34 and 36 described above, a subsequent alert may provide a second level of information or detail (e.g., more
information or detail than is provided in the first level) about the product.  In one embodiment, the alerts and notifications are provided for a particular period of time.
<br/><br/> The technique described above can be performed by the data analysis system described in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2.  The technique described above may be embodied as devices, systems, methods, and/or computer program products.  Accordingly, some or all
of the subject matter described above may be embodied in hardware and/or in software (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, state machines, gate arrays, etc.) Furthermore, the subject matter may take the form of a computer program product
such as an analytical tool, on a computer-usable or computer-readable storage medium having computer-usable or computer-readable program code embodied in the medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system.  In the context of this
description, a computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be any medium that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.
<br/><br/> The computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium.  By way of example, and not
limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media.
<br/><br/> When the subject matter is embodied in the general context of computer-executable instructions, the embodiment may comprise program modules, executed by one or more systems, computers, or other devices.  Generally, program modules include
routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types.  Typically, the functionality of the program modules may be combined or distributed as desired in various
embodiments.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a computer 100 that is configured to analyze social media data retrieved from various social media platforms.  The computer 100 is configured to execute instructions for a data analysis
tool that performs the steps described in FIG. 3.  In a very basic configuration 102, computer 100 typically includes one or more processors 104 and a system memory 106.  A memory bus 124 may be used for communicating between processor 104 and system
memory 106.
<br/><br/> Depending on the desired configuration, processor 104 may be of any type including but not limited to a microprocessor (.mu.P), a microcontroller (.mu.C), a digital signal processor (DSP), or any combination thereof.  Processor 104 may include
one more levels of caching, such as a level one cache 110 and a level two cache 112, a processor core 114, and registers 116.  An example processor core 114 may include an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a floating point unit (FPU), a digital signal
processing core (DSP Core), or any combination thereof.  An example memory controller 118 may also be used with processor 104, or in some implementations memory controller 118 may be an internal part of processor 104.
<br/><br/> Depending on the desired configuration, system memory 106 may be of any type including but not limited to volatile memory (such as RAM), non-volatile memory (such as ROM, flash memory, etc.) or any combination thereof.  System memory 106 may
include an operating system 120, one or more applications 122, and program data 124.  Application 122 include a data analysis tool 120 that is arranged to analyze social media data received from several social media platforms.  Program data 126 may
include social media data.  In some embodiments, application 122 may be arranged to operate with program data 126 on operating system 120 such that interaction between the dispensing devices and external entities are monitored.  This described basic
configuration 102 is illustrated in FIG. 4 by those components within the inner dashed line.
<br/><br/> Computer 100 may have additional features or functionality, and additional interfaces to facilitate communications between basic configuration 102 and any required devices and interfaces.  For example, a bus/interface controller 130 may be used
to facilitate communications between basic configuration 102 and one or more data storage devices 132 via a storage interface bus 138.  Data storage devices 132 may be removable storage devices 134, non-removable storage devices 136, or a combination
thereof.  Examples of removable storage and non-removable storage devices include magnetic disk devices such as flexible disk drives and hard-disk drives (HDD), optical disk drives such as compact disk (CD) drives or digital versatile disk (DVD) drives,
solid state drives (SSD), and tape drives to name a few.  Example computer storage media may include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer readable
instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data.
<br/><br/> System memory 106, removable storage devices 134 and non-removable storage devices 136 are examples of computer storage media.  Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology,
CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which may be used to store the desired information and which may be accessed
by computer 100.  Any such computer storage media may be part of computer 100.
<br/><br/> Computer 100 may also include an interface bus 138 for facilitating communication from various interface devices (e.g., output devices 140, peripheral interfaces 148, and communication devices 160) to basic configuration 102 via bus/interface
controller 130.  Example output devices 142 include a graphics processing unit 144 and an audio processing unit 146, which may be configured to communicate to various external devices such as a display or speakers via one or more A/V ports 142.  Example
peripheral interfaces 148 include a serial interface controller 150 or a parallel interface controller 152, which may be configured to communicate with external devices such as input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, pen, voice input device, touch input
device, etc.) or other peripheral devices (e.g., printer, scanner, etc.) via one or more I/O ports 148.  An example communication device 160 includes a network controller 154, which may be arranged to facilitate communications with one or more other
computer s 158 over a network communication link via one or more communication ports 156.
<br/><br/> The network communication link may be one example of a communication media.  Communication media may typically be embodied by computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal, such as a
carrier wave or other transport mechanism, and may include any information delivery media.  A "modulated data signal" may be a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal.  By
way of example, and not limitation, communication media may include wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, radio frequency (RF), microwave, infrared (IR) and other wireless media.  The term
computer readable media as used herein may include both storage media and communication media.
<br/><br/> Computer 100 may be implemented as a portion of a small-form factor portable (or mobile) electronic device such as a cell phone, a personal data assistant (PDA), a personal media player device, a wireless web-watch device, a personal headset
device, an application specific device, or a hybrid device that include any of the above functions.  Computer 100 may also be implemented as a personal computer including both laptop computer and non-laptop computer configurations.  As described above,
the data analysis tool and system is configured to analyze social media data retrieved from social media platforms.  The data analysis tool and system may include a graphical user interface to facilitate a user to provide input data.  Some example user
interface screens are described below with reference to FIG. 5 through FIG. 11.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a screen shot of a graphical user interface that enables a data analyst to provide input data to the data analysis system.  The data analysis system enables the data analyst to provide a selection of key words in a tab provided as
shown in screen 44.  The data analyst may also provide information related to the keywords that are not relevant.  In addition, the data analyst may select the various social media platforms of interest.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a screen shot of a visual representation of negative sentiment data classified from a social media data.  As can be clearly seen, the screen shot 48 demonstrates the classification of the text data based on positive, negative and
neutral sentiments.  The screen shot 48 illustrates the negative words and a frequency of the negative words.  The screen shot 46 of FIG. 7 illustrates the frequency of positive tweets, negative tweets and neutral tweets retrieved for various groups in
response the input data "Xbox".
<br/><br/> Similarly, the screen shot 52 illustrates all social media data retrieved for the input data "xbox" as shown in FIG. 8.  The bar chart illustrates the frequency of the input data at different instants of time.  FIG. 9 illustrates the various
topics that have been derived for the input data "Siri".  Topic modeling schemes enable the identification of several themes that are present in the text data.  Further, the topic modeling schemes determine a relative importance of each word within a
topic.  For example in screen shot 52, the words, which are more relevant, are indicated in larger boxes.  In one embodiment, a color scheme is also implemented to indicate the relevancy of each word.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 illustrates opinion trends for the input data "xbox".  Screen shot 54 illustrates the positive and negative opinion graph for the input data as seen on Dec.  21, 2011.  FIG. 11 illustrates key influencers for the input data "xbox".  As
can be seen in screen shot 56, the key influencers are identified.  In addition, the social profile of each influencer is also made readily available.  FIG. 12 illustrates historical data from Twitter for the input data "Big Data" and "Hadoop".  Screen
shot 58 illustrates tweets retrieved from Twitter for the input data and corresponding metrics.  FIG. 13 is a screen shot illustrating the various geographic locations associated with the text data.  Screen shot 60 illustrated the source of text data on
a world map as shown.
<br/><br/> It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as "open" terms (e.g., the term "including" should be
interpreted as "including but not limited to," the term "having" should be interpreted as "having at least," the term "includes" should be interpreted as "includes but is not limited to," etc.).  It will be further understood by those within the art that
if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present.
<br/><br/> For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim recitations.  However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to
imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or "an" limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the
introductory phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "an" (e.g., "a" and/or "an" should be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce
claim recitations.  In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare
recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations).
<br/><br/> While only certain features of several embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications and changes will occur to those skilled in the art.  It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to
cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the invention.
