</font><br/>
       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A computerized method for engaging a user of a mobile computer system,
     The mobile computer system may be connectible to a server over a wide
     area network. An audio signal of ambient audio is autonomously sampled in
     the vicinity of the mobile computer system to capture one or more audio
     samples of the audio signal. The multiple samples of the audio signal are
     autonomously sampled without requiring any interaction from the user,
     thus avoiding an input from the user to capture each of the samples. The
     audio sample may be processed to extract an audio signature of the audio
     sample. The audio signature may be compared with multiple previously
     stored reference audio signatures. Upon matching the audio signature with
     at least one reference audio signature a matched reference audio
     signature may be produced.

stamp and at least one of (i) a sample of a first audio signal captured by the first device at the first time stamp or (ii) a first audio signature representative of the first audio signal sample;  determining, using the at least one processor, whether
the first audio signature corresponds to a second audio signature, the second audio signature being representative of a sample of a second audio signal captured by a second device at a second time stamp;  and when the first audio signature is determined
to correspond to the second audio signature, and when the second time stamp falls within a predetermined time period of the first time stamp, providing, using the at least one processor, and to the second device, first information advising at least a
user of a second device of the determined correspondence between the first and second audio signatures.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, further comprising, when the first audio signature is determined to correspond to the second audio signature, providing the first information to a plurality of second devices, the first information advising users of
the second devices of the determined correspondence between the first and second audio signatures.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 2, wherein the providing further comprises providing the first information to at least one social network.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one of the first or second devices corresponds to a mobile device.

<br/><br/> 1.  Technical Field
<br/><br/> The field of the present disclosure relates to ambient sound capture and a system and method for interacting with a person in the presence of ambient audio.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of Related Art
<br/><br/> With the proliferation of social media platforms, users may be interested in sharing information about their media exposure.
<br/><br/> Examples of such social media platforms include social networking systems, e.g. <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> myspace, etc.), professional networking systems, LinkedIn, virtual world platforms, e.g. Second Life, messaging systems (e.g., Google email (Gmail),
Skype), blogging systems (e.g., Blogspot.com).  Social networking has grown rapidly in popularity because of an "entertainment" factor which allows people to interact, communicate and share using multiple types of data and communication channels.  For
example, a number of social networking platforms provide one or more messaging tools, and photo and video sharing capabilities.  Virtual worlds similarly host vibrant communities of people who interact, play, do business and even find romance online.
<br/><br/> Media stations, such as radio stations and television stations, typically devote a portion of broadcast time to advertisements.  Advertisement broadcast time is sold to advertisers, frequently through advertising agencies, and the sold broadcast
time generates revenue for the media station.  Advertisers use various marketing strategies to test and track advertisements to ensure that less effective advertisements are discontinued in favor of more effective advertising.
<br/><br/> Broadcast media, such as radio and television, inherently provide only one-way flow of information, thus precluding information flow from, or about, the listener or viewer back to the broadcaster.  Hence advertisements over such media are
unidirectional and lack a facility to gain information from the listener or viewer, take an action, or allow a user to notify their friends in their social network, in response to the advertisement.  In contrast, network-based systems, such as the
Internet or telephone networks, do provide two-way communication and thus enable a listener or viewer to immediately respond to an advertisement and even to interact with it.
<br/><br/> Hearing impaired individuals have difficulty with traditional platforms such as television, radio, live events, and other special situations, for example, emergency warnings (e.g. an air raid siren, or tsunami siren.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY
<br/><br/> According to an aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a computerized method for engaging a user of a mobile computer system, The mobile computer system may be connectible to a server over a wide area network.  An audio signal of
ambient audio is autonomously sampled in the vicinity of the mobile computer system to capture one or more audio samples of the audio signal.  The multiple samples of the audio signal are autonomously sampled without requiring any interaction from the
user, thus avoiding an input from the user to capture each of the samples.  The audio sample may be processed to extract an audio signature of the audio sample.  The audio signature may be compared with multiple previously stored reference audio
signatures.  Upon matching the audio signature with at least one reference audio signature a matched reference audio signature may be produced.  An action to engage the user may be performed, and/or data based upon the match may be logged.  The action
may be associated with the matched reference audio signature.
<br/><br/> As part of autonomous sampling, the sampling may be paused when the mobile computer system or device is being used for another process, and the sampling may be autonomously restarted when the other process is complete.  For example, if the
mobile device is a telephone, sampling may be paused during a phone call or during other processes that rely on a microphone and/or speaker.
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the invention may involve action intended to engage the user, such as: presenting to the user at least one data object of a universal resource locator (URL), a Web page, an active link to a Web page, a text message, a video
message, an audio message, a multimedia message, an active link to a social network account, a message to or from a social network account, an advertisement, an interactive menu, an alarm a call to the mobile computer system, a cash transfer, a call to
another computerized device and/or a vibration of the mobile computer system.  Parameters may be stored for controlling the autonomous sampling by downloading the parameters from the server.  The reference audio signatures may be previously stored by
downloading from the server.  Data object or a pointer to data object may be downloaded from the server.  The data objects associated with the reference audio signatures, specify the action intended to engage the user.  The comparison and matching of the
reference audio signature to the audio signature of the ambient audio and the action intended to engage the user may be performed autonomously by the mobile computer system.  Alternatively, audio signature may be uploaded to a server and the comparison
with and matching with the reference signature may be performed by the server.  When the server matches the audio signature to one of the reference signatures, a data object may be downloaded or a pointer to the data object (which points to data storage
in the mobile computer system) which specifies the action to be performed to engage the user.
<br/><br/> Optionally, multiple reference signatures may be extracted from previously known audio content.  A broadcast signal may be captured, sampled and processed at the server to extract from the broadcast signal a broadcast signature.  The broadcast
signature may be compared with the reference signatures.  Upon matching the broadcast signature to the reference signature, a trigger event may be generated including a corresponding broadcast time of the trigger event.  The broadcast time substantially
equals the time of broadcast of the broadcast signal sample.  The trigger event including the broadcast time may be transmitted to the mobile computer system.  Meanwhile, audio samples may be cached by storing the audio sample with a corresponding time
stamp in storage of the mobile computer system.  Upon receiving from the server the trigger event including the broadcast time, the audio sample may be transmitted to the server if the time stamp may be within a previously defined real time interval
including the broadcast time.  Typically, the time interval may be less than five minutes or less than four minutes.  The audio sample with the time stamp may be received at the server.  At the server, the audio sample may be processed to extract the
audio signature, the audio signature may be compared with the previously stored reference audio signatures, and the audio signature may be matched with the reference audio signature to produce the matched reference audio signature.

<br/><br/> Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 illustrates a simplified block diagram of a mobile computer system 100 according to features of the present invention.  Mobile computer system 100 is connectible over a network 106 to a server 108.  Mobile
computer system 100 is also connectible through a cellular base station transceiver 119 to cellular network 121 (e.g., through cellular communications 117).  Mobile computer system 100 includes a processor 110C connected to local data storage 101C.  A
data communications module 104C operatively connects processor 110C to data network 106.  A cellular communications module operatively connects processor 110C to cellular network 121.  Mobile computer system 100 may include operatively connected to
processor 11 OC peripheral accessory devices such as a display 109, global positioning system 107, a camera 105, a microphone 111, a speaker 113, a vibrator 115 and accelerometer/gravity sensor, Bluetooth, IR sensor (not shown).  Reference is now also
made to FIG. 1a which includes a simplified block diagram of a server 108a according to embodiments of the present invention.  Server 108a includes a processing unit 11 OS connected to storage 101S and to a data communications module 104S which is
connectible to network 106 e.g. wide area network or Internet.  Server 108a may include an input from a broadcast receiver 125 and may receive an audio signal as a feed from broadcast receiver 125.
<br/><br/> Reference is now made to FIGS. 2A,2B,2C and 2D which are flow diagrams illustrating a method according to an embodiment of the present invention.  Referring now to FIG. 2D, in step 201, mobile computer system 100 is configured to autonomously
sample ambient audio or sound in the vicinity of mobile computer system 100 using microphone 111, processor 110C and storage 101C.  According to a feature of the present invention, the user powers up the mobile computer system 100, gives permission to
run an application on mobile computer system 100 according to features of the present invention.  The application runs for instance in the background to perform recording/capturing/sampling or storing of ambient audio autonomously without requiring any
input from the user.  Hereinafter the terms "recording, capturing and sampling are used herein interchangeably and refers to storage of the ambient audio information.  The term "autonomously" as used herein in the present context refers to capture of one
sample or multiple samples of the audio signal while avoiding or without requiring a request or input from the user to capture each of the samples.  "Autonomous sampling" may include periodic sampling for instance, capturing an audio sample of one second
duration during a ten second time interval, according to the sampling parameters stored in mobile computer system 100.  According to a feature of the present invention, "autonomous" sampling may begin as soon as the sampling parameters are stored when
the application is first installed in mobile computer system 100 without requiring the user to load the application.
<br/><br/> According to a feature of the present invention, mobile computer system 100 may sense the ambient audio level and when the audio level increases over a threshold then sampling is performed without requiring an input from the user.  The threshold
may be previously determined or may be dynamically determined by sensing the ambient noise background.
<br/><br/> The term "user" herein is the person in the vicinity of mobile computer system 100.  Reference is now also made to FIG. 2B which illustrates a flow diagram according to features of the present invention.  In step 215, server 108 downloads audio
sampling parameters 223 and in step 217 the sampling parameters are stored in storage 101C.  Sampling parameters 223 may include sampling rate, sampling frequency, sampling duration.  Sampling parameters 223 may be adjusted by a server application run at
server 108.  The ambient audio information may be captured and stored in any known form, e.g. data format, including but not limited to raw data samples such a pulse code modulated (PCM) digitally sampled format, such as Waveform Audio File Format (WAVE,
or more commonly known as WAV) or encoded formats for instance known as Windows Media Audio (WMA) or MP3.  MP3 is an audio format that was designed by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG).  Other sampling parameters 223 are downloadable (in step 215)
and adjustable by server 108 may include the form, e.g. PCM of audio capture and parameters specific to the form.  Referring back to step 201 of FIG. 2D, "ambient audio" in the vicinity of mobile computer system 100 refers to an audio signal from any
source human, animal, or machine.  The audio signal may emanate from speakers connected to another computer system.  The audio source may for instance be an alarm such as a doorbell or an air-raid siren.  The source of ambient audio signal may be a live
broadcast receiver, such as a television or radio program or advertisement provided synchronously at multiple broadcast receivers.  The audio source may be previously recorded and asynchronous such as at the cinema.  Referring now to step 203 in FIG. 2D,
the captured audio signal sample is processed to extract an audio signature 209.  Various methods for extracting an audio signature from audio samples are known in the art.
<br/><br/> For example U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,677,466 discloses a number of methods to extract an audio signature from audio signals received from broadcasts.  In decision block 205C, extracted signature 209 is compared with previously stored reference
signatures.  If there is a match with one of the reference signatures, then the ambient sound may be identified and action (step 207) based on the match to engage the user is performed.  The action to engage the user may Include but is not limited to
visual message on display 109 in the form of universal resource locator (URL), a Web page, an active link to a Web page, a text message, a video message.  Alternatively, or in addition, action (step 207) may include an audio message, a multimedia message
or an alarm using speaker 113.  Action (step 207) to engage the user may include alternatively, or in addition an active link to a social network account, a message to or from a social network account, an advertisement, an interactive menu, a call to the
mobile computer system, a call to another computerized device over cellular network 121 and/or a vibration of mobile computer system 100 using vibrator 115.
<br/><br/> Reference is now made to FIG. 2A which illustrates further aspects of the present invention.  Reference signatures may be generated by processing reference audio samples and extracting the reference signatures.  Reference signatures of the
reference audio sample may be stored at server 108 and downloaded (step 211) from server 108 to storage 101C in mobile communication system 100.  Reference is now made to FIG. 2C which illustrates another aspect of the present invention.  Data objects
are typically associated with the audio references or reference signatures 129.  The data objects specify the action which engages the user.  Data objects may be downloaded from server 108 (step 219) to storage 101C in mobile communication system 100
(step 221).
<br/><br/> In an example of the method of FIGS. 2A-2D, a reference audio signature 129 of an air raid siren of is downloaded (step 211) and stored (step 213) in mobile computer system 100.  A data object 225 associated with an air-raid siren causes a
vibration of mobile computer system 100 and display of the words AIR RAID on display 109.  Using a method as illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2D a hearing impaired person who otherwise would be dependent on others may be assisted with use of mobile computer
system 100 which responds with an alarm to the ambient air raid siren.  Mobile computer system 100 autonomously samples (step 201) ambient audio, and the ambient audio is processed to extract audio signatures 209.  If the ambient audio signature matches
(step 205) the previously stored reference signature 129 for the air raid siren then an action 207 which is specified by associated data object 225 causes the vibration and flashing display of the words "air raid" on display 109.
<br/><br/> Reference is now made to FIGS. 3A and 3B which a variation of a method of the present invention.  FIG. 3A generally illustrates a sub-process being performed by mobile computer system 100 and FIG. 3B generally illustrates a parallel sub-process
being performed at server 108.  Referring back to FIG. 1A, broadcast receiver 125 may provide an audio feed in raw or encoded/compressed form of a media broadcast to processing unit 110S.  Processing unit 110S may sample and process the broadcast audio
feed and store accordingly reference signatures in storage 101S optionally with time stamps.  Mobile computer system 100 autonomously samples (step 201) ambient audio and the ambient audio is processed autonomously in real time to extract audio
signatures 209 of the ambient audio.  The extracted signatures 209 are uploaded (step 231) over network 106 or cellular network 121 to analysis server 108.  In step 233, the extracted audio signatures 209 are received together with time stamps and other
relevant data.  Comparison 205 with reference signatures may be performed at server 108.  If a match occurs then a data object or pointer to a data object which may already be stored in mobile computer system 100 may be downloaded.  If in decision box
232, a data object or pointer is received then an action may be performed (step 207) to engage the user.
<br/><br/> According to a feature the method of FIGS. 3A and 3B may be applied to media broadcasts in real time or near real time.  The time stamps of the extracted audio samples 208 may be calibrated with the time stamp of the reference signature taking
into account small delays between reception at various receivers.  The time stamp calibration or time alignment may be used for performing the comparison and match (step 205).  As an example of the method of FIGS. 3A and 3B, President Obama appears on
television in a live broadcast.  President Obama's media advisers prepared a questionnaire, for the listeners of the President's speech.  Referring back to FIG. 1A, broadcasts receiver 125 receives the audio signal of the speech and reference signatures
of the speech are stored at server 108a.  Meanwhile, multiple mobile computer systems 100 similarly process the ambient audio of the President's speech and upload extracted signatures 209 to analysis server 108a.  At server 108a, extracted signatures
from mobile computer systems 100 are compared and if a match is found, the questionnaire (an example of data object 225) for instance in the form of an active link to a Web page is downloaded (step 237) to and received (step 232) by mobile computer
systems 100.
<br/><br/> Reference is now made to FIG. 1B which illustrates a server 108b and FIGS. 4A, 48, 4C, and 4D which combine to illustrate a method according to another example of the present invention.  FIG. 1B includes a trigger event generator module 123
which may be implemented by processing unit 11 OS or a second server 108a.  Reference is now also made to FIG. 4A which illustrates a method of trigger event generation implemented by trigger event generator module 123.  Trigger event generator module
receives a feed from a broadcast receiver 125 and reference signatures 129 and outputs a trigger event 127.  Trigger event generator 123 may capture and/or sample (step 401) the broadcast feed, process the sample to extract a signature 209 (step 403). 
Trigger event generator 123 inputs one or more reference signatures 129 (step 405) and compares with extracted signatures 209 from the broadcast feed (step 407).  If there is a match then trigger event 127 is generated and transmitted (step 409) to
mobile computer system 100.  Reference is now made to FIG. 4C and FIG. 4D which illustrates parallel sub-processes being performed by mobile computer system 100.  In step 201, ambient audio is captured by mobile computer system 100 and audio samples are
cached (step 413).  Reference is now made also to FIG. 40.  If trigger event 127 is received (step 415), then mobile computer system may respond for instance by transmitting (step 417) the cached samples received with time stamps during an interval which
includes the time of the trigger event, for instance cached samples are transmitted (step 417) from mobile computer system 100 to server 108b when the time stamps of the cached samples are within two minutes before and one minute after the time stamp of
trigger event 127.  Reference is now also made to FIG. 4B which illustrates a continuation of the process.  The audio samples (with time stamps within a time interval including the time of trigger event 127) are received (step 411) from mobile computer
system 100 at server 108b.  The samples are processed (step 203) to extract signatures 209.  The extracted signatures are compared with stored reference signatures 129.  If there is match then a data object is downloaded or a pointer to a data object is
downloaded to mobile computer system 100.  If there is no match in decision block 205 then the process may continue with processing audio samples (step 203) or waiting to receive (step 411) audio samples.  The process continues as illustrated in FIG. 40. At the mobile computer system, if a data object or pointer is received (decision block 232) then an action is performed (step 207) associated with the data object or pointer.
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the present invention may find use in more detailed analysis of the extent of listener exposure to broadcasts or ambient audio.  Mobile computer system 100 and/or server 108 may log exposure to ambient sounds and/or broadcasts. 
It may be determined not only that a broadcast was received, but whether the user/listener actually listened or paid attention to the sound or broadcast.  Action 207 which is intended to engage the user and the response to action 207 may also be logged
and used to gather more detailed information for research or other purposes.
<br/><br/> Various embodiments of the invention may involve the "enabling" of certain activities, steps or functions.  Enabling may occur either directly or indirectly.  Examples of direct enabling include making, using, or selling a system or components
of a system to achieve the associated activity, step or function; or operating or providing at least one processor in order to achieve the associated activity, step, or function.  Examples of indirect enabling include sending or receiving signals (e.g.,
over a network) to a processor in order to achieve the associated activity, step or function; providing software to enable a user to participate in a system that achieves the activity, step, or function; and offering a service, system, application, or
software such that the activity, step or function occurs as the result of a user's acceptance of that offer.  Thus, one who provides or advertises a software download that, when used, directly or indirectly results in achievement of an associated
activity, step or function, enables that function within the meaning of this disclosure.
<br/><br/> For example, embodiments of the invention may include a method of monitoring media exposure, enabling autonomous sampling of ambient audio in a vicinity of a mobile computing device to permit capture of audio signals associated with a plurality
of differing media events, whereby capture of audio signals associated with the plurality of differing media events is enabled to occur during a single autonomous sampling period characterized by an absence of user intervention between captured signals
associated with the differing media events.
<br/><br/> The term "mobile" computing device" as used herein, may include any portable device that includes a processor.  Examples include mobile phones, tablets (e.g., IPad), laptops, netbooks, PDAs, and other mobile computer systems.
<br/><br/> A single autonomous sampling period includes any time period that, once begun, does not necessarily require an act of human intervention in order for sampling to continue, regardless of whether the sampling period is continuous or made up of a
series of discrete sampling segments.  Thus, an autonomous sampling period may be said to exist when multiple media events may be sampled without the user selecting each individual event for sampling.
<br/><br/> As used herein, a "media event" includes a television program, radio program, movie, show, commercial, infomercial, Internet-based broadcast, Internet-based advertisement, live event, for example sport event, concert or political rally, or any
discrete portion or portions thereof, regardless of whether reproduced or presented on television, radio, in a cinema, in a private or public transport vehicle, at a live performance or other public event, via satellite (e.g., Dish Network, Serius/XM
radio), over the Internet or another network, or through any other mechanism capable of reproducing audio.
<br/><br/> Thus, autonomous sampling of ambient audio in a vicinity of a mobile computing device to permit capture of audio signals associated with a plurality of differing media events, may include the sampling of two differing events broadcast through
two differing sources (e.g., TV and radio), or two differing events broadcast over the same source (e.g., TV show #1 and TV show #2).  Differing media events may include a TV show and a commercial broadcast within the TV show.
<br/><br/> Using embodiments of the invention it may be possible for a user's mobile computing device such as a cellular telephone, to monitor the user's media exposure for extended periods (e.g., continuous hours, full days, etc.) without necessarily
requiring user intervention.  For example, a user might opt-in such that whenever the user's mobile computing device is turned on, it is in a mode for enabling sampling of media exposure without human intervention.  Alternatively, once the user
affirmatively activates a sampling feature, the mobile computing device might autonomously sample without human intervention, until the feature is deactivated.  In either instance, there is a "single autonomous sampling period" characterized by the fact
that at least two media events may be sampled without intermediate intervention by the user between the two events.
<br/><br/> The mobile computing device might implement a sampling scheme whereby sampling occurs at predefined intervals, periodically, randomly, or in response to an audible stimulus.  The scheme might permit interruption of sampling when the mobile
computing device is involved in another use, such as for a phone call.  In this instance, the sampling scheme may remain transparent to the user, and therefore is considered autonomous within the meaning of this disclosure.
<br/><br/> An embodiment of the invention may involve enabling processing of said audio signals to extract at least two audio signatures, each audio signature associated with a differing media event.  An audio signature may be any signal or portion of a
signal that serves as an identifier for a media event.  So for example, one signature may serve as an identifier for one television show, and another signature might serve as an identifier for another television show.  Multiple audio samples and audio
signatures might be sampled and extract for each media event.  Indeed, to determine whether a user continues to be exposed to a media event, continuous signatures might be generated for the same event.
<br/><br/> Depending on desired configuration, signature extraction may occur at the client or server side.  (e.g., mobile computing device or remote server).  Regardless of where located, supplying a software application for a mobile phone, for example,
is one example of enabling audio signature extraction.
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the invention may enable a comparison of each of the at least two extracted audio signatures with a plurality of previously stored reference audio signatures to identify at least a first match between a first of the two extracted
audio signatures and a first associated reference audio signature, and to enable at least a second match of a second of the two extracted audio signatures with a second associated reference audio signature.  The previously stored reference audio
signatures may be retained on the client side or server side, and may serve as an indicator for a media event.  Thus, a determined match signals that the user is exposed to a known media event associated with that match.
<br/><br/> After identifying the first match, embodiments of the invention may enable an output of first information reflective of the user's exposure to a first media event; and after identifying the second match, embodiments of the invention may enable
output of second information reflective of the user's exposure to a second media event.  Such output may take various forms.  In one sense, the output may be raw data provided to indicate media exposure.  This data may be provided to, for example, an
advertiser, broadcaster, or consultant interested in aggregating information about media exposure.  Alternatively, the information may be output to social media interface.  In this way, a user's <b><i>Facebook</i></b> friends, for example, might be advised that the
user is currently watching a particular television program.  This information might then be used to prompt a discussion about the program, or to automatically place the user in a sub-group of individual (e.g., friends) who are watching the same show. 
The a method of the invention may involve outputting information to a social networking site associated with the user, in order to reveal the user's media exposure to other users.
<br/><br/> Although selected embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood the present invention is not limited to the described embodiments.  Instead, it is to be appreciated that changes may be made to these
embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined by the claims and the equivalents thereof.
