<br/><br/> 1.  Field of the Invention
<br/><br/> This invention relates generally to electronic communication management and, more specifically, to integrating and searching electronic communications received from multiple communication platforms.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of the Related Art
<br/><br/> Over the past several decades, numerous communications technologies have become commonplace.  This includes the Internet, which provides personalized web sites, weblogs, and the like, to electronic mail, which has migrated from conventional
Internet clients such as personal computers, over to cellular phones, personal digital assistants, and dedicated wireless electronic mail clients.  Other technologies such as facsimiles, voice mail, Short Messaging Service ("SMS") and the like are also
commonplace.  In general, each new medium provides a separate communication channel with its own underlying technology.
<br/><br/> Two persons connected socially and/or professionally may communicate with each other via different mechanisms such as text messages via smart phone, instant messages, email and in-mail, i.e., messaging embedded within social and professional
network platforms.  Since this communication happens via multiple channels, it makes it difficult for an end user or some other entity to look back at two-party or three-party communications historically for search, analytics, etc.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> In general, embodiments described herein provide approaches for integrating and searching electronic communications received from a plurality of different communication platforms.  Specifically, a consolidated communication and messaging
platform integrates and consolidates communications/messages from individuals, groups, or other entities from various channels (e.g., text messaging, instant messaging, social networking platforms, e-mail, and the like), and enables end users to search
and locate content or substance of a specific communication via a user interface and locally stored repository.
<br/><br/> One aspect of the present invention includes a method comprising computer-implemented steps of: receiving electronic communications from each of a plurality of different communication platforms; compiling the electronic communications according
to an identity of a sender; storing the electronic communications on a client system of an end user; and enabling a search of the electronic communications based on at least one of the identity of the sender and a keyword.
<br/><br/> Another aspect of the present invention provides a computer system for integrating and searching electronic communications received from a plurality of different communication platforms, the computer system comprising: a memory medium comprising
program instructions; a bus coupled to the memory medium; and a processor, for executing the program instructions, coupled to an integration platform via the bus that when executing the program instructions causes the system to: receive electronic
communications from each of the plurality of different communication platforms; compile the electronic communications according to an identity of a sender; store the electronic communications on a client system of the end user; and enable a search of the
electronic communications based on at least one of the identity of the sender and a keyword.
<br/><br/> Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for integrating and searching electronic communications received from a plurality of different communication platforms, the method comprising: receiving, using at least one computing
device, an electronic communication from each of the plurality of different communication platforms; compiling, using the at least one computing device, the electronic communications according to an identity of a sender; storing, using the at least one
computing device, the electronic communications on a client system of the end user; and enabling, using the at least one computing device, a search of the electronic communications based on at least one of the identity of the sender and a keyword.

understood that the terms "comprises" and/or "comprising", or "includes" and/or "including", when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude
the presence or addition of one or more other features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.
<br/><br/> Unless specifically stated otherwise, it may be appreciated that terms such as "processing," "computing," "determining," "evaluating," or the like, refer to the action and/or processes of a computer or computing system, or similar electronic
data center device, that manipulates and/or transforms data represented as physical quantities (e.g., electronic) within the computing system's registers and/or memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computing
system's memories, registers or other such information storage, transmission or viewing devices.  The embodiments are not limited in this context.
<br/><br/> As stated above, embodiments described herein provide approaches for integrating and searching electronic communications received from multiple, different communication platforms.  Specifically, a consolidated communication/messaging platform
integrates and consolidates bi-directional communications/messages from individuals, groups, or other entities from various channels (e.g., text messaging, instant messaging, social networking platforms and e-mail), and enables end users to search and
locate content or substance of a specific communication via a user interface and locally stored repository.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 1, a computerized implementation 100 of an exemplary embodiment will be shown and described.  As depicted, implementation 100 includes computer system 104 deployed within a computer infrastructure 102 (e.g., a client
device).  This is intended to demonstrate, among other things, that the present invention could be implemented within a network environment (e.g., the Internet, a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), a virtual private network (VPN),
etc.), a cloud-computing environment, or on a stand-alone computer system.  Communication throughout the network can occur via any combination of various types of communication links.  For example, the communication links can comprise addressable
connections that may utilize any combination of wired and/or wireless transmission methods.  Where communications occur via the Internet, connectivity could be provided by conventional TCP/IP sockets-based protocol, and an Internet service provider could
be used to establish connectivity to the Internet.  Still yet, computer infrastructure 102 is intended to demonstrate that some or all of the components of implementation 100 could be deployed, managed, serviced, etc., by a service provider who offers to
implement, deploy, and/or perform the functions of the present invention for others.
<br/><br/> Computer system 104 is intended to represent any type of computer system that may be implemented in deploying/realizing the teachings recited herein.  In this particular example, computer system 104 represents an illustrative system for
integrating and searching a plurality of electronic communications received from multiple communication platforms.  It should be understood that any other computers implemented under the present invention may have different components/software, but will
perform similar functions.  As shown, computer system 104 includes a processing unit 106 capable of communicating with an integration platform 118 stored in memory 108, a bus 110, and device interfaces 112.
<br/><br/> Processing unit 106 refers, generally, to any apparatus that performs logic operations, computational tasks, control functions, etc. A processor may include one or more subsystems, components, and/or other processors.  A processor will typically
include various logic components that operate using a clock signal to latch data, advance logic states, synchronize computations and logic operations, and/or provide other timing functions.  During operation, processing unit 106 collects and routes
signals representing inputs and outputs between external devices 115 and integration platform 118.  The signals can be transmitted over a LAN and/or a WAN (e.g., T1, T3, 56 kb, X.25), broadband connections (ISDN, Frame Relay, ATM), wireless links
(802.11, Bluetooth, etc.), and so on.  In some embodiments, the signals may be encrypted using, for example, trusted key-pair encryption.  Different systems may transmit information using different communication pathways, such as Ethernet or wireless
networks, direct serial or parallel connections, USB, Firewire.RTM., Bluetooth.RTM., or other proprietary interfaces.  (Firewire is a registered trademark of Apple Computer, Inc.  Bluetooth is a registered trademark of Bluetooth Special Interest Group
(SIG)).
<br/><br/> In general, processing unit 106 executes computer program code, such as program code for operating integration platform 118, which is stored in memory 108 and/or storage system 116.  While executing computer program code, processing unit 106 can
read and/or write data to/from memory 108, storage system 116, and integration platform 118.  Storage system 116 can include VCRs, DVRs, RAID arrays, USB hard drives, optical disk recorders, flash storage devices, and/or any other data processing and
storage elements for storing and/or processing data.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 2, the structure and operation of a system 200 for integrating and enabling searching of electronic communications received from multiple communication platforms according to exemplary embodiments will be described in
greater detail.  As illustrated, system 200 is configured to receive a plurality of communications (e.g., one-to-one, bi-directional messages) from a sender 220 via multiple communication platforms, e.g., communication modalities such as e-mail
applications, SMS applications, social network applications, instant-messaging applications, peer-to-peer applications, etc., which include all necessary components and functionality for receiving input(s) from sender 220.  In FIG. 2, the communication
platforms are represented by social network application 222 and messaging applications A-1, A-2, A-3, B-1, B-2, and B-3.  These applications generate and transmit text messages, instant messages, e-mails, social networking messages and/or e-mails, and
the like.  It will be appreciated that any number of messaging service providers (e.g., Messaging Service Providers A and B) may provide/manage the various messaging applications.  Furthermore, the messaging applications may include one or more cloud
computing applications (e.g., Messaging Cloud Applications A-3 and B-2).  As is known, cloud-based applications operate in a networked/cloud-computing environment and may provide computation resources enhanced by one or more additional abstraction layers
(e.g., a cloud layer), thus making disparate devices appear to an end-consumer as a single pool of seamless resources.
<br/><br/> System 200 further comprises an analytics engine 224, which operates with, or is a subcomponent of, integration platform 218.  Analytics engine 224 is configured to receive data (e.g., message browsing data, identity data, spam data, message
metadata) corresponding to each of the electronic communications, and compile the electronic communications, e.g., based on an identity of sender 220 as determined with data from an identity management device 228.  In one embodiment, analytics engine 224
receives input signals from the various messaging applications, wherein the input signals may be converted into commands.  The input signals may encode data in any format suitable for interpretation by analytics engine 224 including text, audio (such as
voice audio, dual-tone multi-frequency audio, and so forth), a barcode scan, an image, a video, a selection, a data feed item, a sensor measurement, a clock tick, an alarm, a client context description, sender and receiving information, user privilege
information, textual information (e.g., e-mail or SMS message), tabular information (e.g., cell phone UI table or web form), non-textual input, and/or the like.  The commands may be computer-interpretable commands, e.g., in a command language definition
(CLD) format or other command language format.  The input signals may already be in a command format where, for example, a client device can generate corresponding output.  Each input signal may include or be associated with a well-formed instruction, a
malformed instruction, a longhand instruction, a shorthand instruction, an alternate instruction, or the like.  In one embodiment, each input is encoded/decoded into a binary representation to a format suitable for presentation to an end user 230 via a
user interface.
<br/><br/> Analytics engine 224 further provides the necessary functional components for handling data integration from each of the plurality of messaging applications, e.g., by conversion of data from a first format suitable for use with the first
messaging application to a second format suitable for use with the second message application, or by conversion of data from the first format to a format common to multiple messaging applications.  Furthermore, analytics engine 224 may comprise a parser
(not specifically shown) for conducting syntax analysis and semantic parsing on expressions within the electronic communications.  The expression may be a logical expression, a textual expression, a binary expression, a hexadecimal expression, an octal
expression, or any and all other kinds and/or encodings of expression.  The syntax analysis may utilize context-free grammar and may attempt to match an expression to the grammar, wherein an input signal may include the expression.  The context-free
grammar may be relaxed so as to accept some invalid grammatical constructs.  The semantic parsing may be directed at working out an intent or implication of an expression that has been accepted by the syntax analysis.
<br/><br/> As further shown, system 200 includes identity management device 228, which can compile a collection of user and/or business information in a searchable directory.  The information for identity management device 228 may come from electronic
presences, email, text messages, hard copy, or the like.  Identity management device 228 may be a private directory, a public directory, or any other type of directory.  The collection of users may be from a group (e.g. professional), association,
society, or the like.  The directory may include personal information, association to a business, association to another member of the association, association membership information (e.g. office held), or the like.  The directory information for each
user may include keywords, tags, or the like that may permit aggregation of user information.
<br/><br/> Identity management device 228 may have an aggregation capability.  The aggregation may be performed on any of the fields within the directory such as name, location, business, association, electronic communication type, communication dates,
platform types, and the like.  The aggregation of information may return related users and businesses as part of the aggregation.  The aggregation may also be performed using the tags that may be associated with a particular user.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 2, analytics engine 224 may communicate with social network application 222 (e.g., Twitter.RTM., Facebook.RTM., LinkedIn.RTM., etc.), which contains a social network platform user interface 232 for displaying integrated messages
to end user 230.  (Twitter is a registered trademark of Twitter, Inc.  having an address at 1355 Market Street, Suite 900 San Francisco, Calif.  94103, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> is a registered trademark of <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Inc.  having an address at 1601 Willow Road Menlo
Park, Calif.  94025, and LinkedIn is a registered trademark of LinkedIn Corporation having an address at Stierlin Court Mountain View, Calif.  94043.) In this embodiment, the integrated messages are compiled, converted (if necessary), and displayed
within the existing user interface 232 of social network application 222.  That is, all messages from each system/platform are integrated into a user-selected communication platform (e.g., Facebook.RTM.) from the plurality of different communication
platforms available or previously used.  In another embodiment, end user 230 may view and search communications via a custom user interface 236, e.g., in an application that is specifically designed for displaying communications of different formats that
originate from different messaging platforms.  In this embodiment, analytics engine 224 can communicate with custom user interface 236, which can contain a custom user interface platform 238 for integrating and enabling a search of the electronic
communications.
<br/><br/> During operation, analytics engine 224 and integration platform 218 store each of the electronic communications on a client system for end user 230 in a local repository, e.g., storage system 116 shown in FIG. 1, to enable a later search of the
plurality of communications.  Each communication is stored together with message browsing data, identity data, spam data, message metadata, etc., which enables a query by end user 230 via the user interface, e.g., based on a keyword, the identity of
sender 220, and a date/time range.  The query may be a database query, such as and without limitation, a structured query language (SQL) query, which may be communicated according to open database connectivity (ODBC).
<br/><br/> Consider the non-limiting example in which sender 220 and end user 230 are both professionally and socially connected and communicate via different channels, e.g., <b><i>Facebook</i></b> email/chat, LinkedIn in-mail, and e-mail, as well as text periodically
via their smart phones.  End user 230 gets a text message about a communication that sender 220 transmitted a few months back regarding a conference presentation.  End user 230, however, is unsure which communication platform was used for this particular
communication.  With system 200, end user 230 may log-in to a user selected interface (e.g., UI 236) to view all electronic exchanges (e.g., email, text, chat, etc.) with sender 220 for a given period of time, and/or for the given subject matter (i.e.,
the conference presentation).  End user 230 is able to efficiently locate the original message from sender 220 and respond accordingly.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the method that performs communication integration and searching can be provided on a subscription, advertising, and/or fee basis.  That is, a service provider could offer to provide the storage of the electronic
communications on the client system and the searching of the plurality of communications.  In this case, each communication platform associated with each user is first registered with the service provider, which can then create, maintain, support, etc.,
a computer infrastructure, such as system 200 (FIG. 2) that performs the processes of the invention for one or more consumers.  In return, the service provider can receive payment from the consumer(s) under a subscription and/or fee agreement.  According
to this embodiment, the following non-limiting steps may be carried out: 1.  End user 230 registers for this service with the provider and provides, or allows recognition of, all email, text, and/or social networking messaging platforms used; 2.  end
user 230 subscribes to this service by paying a monthly subscription fee; 3.  end user 230 receives a customized user interface/log-in page, which can be modified as desired by end user 230; 4.  when desired, end user 230 is able to log-in and see
streams of messages that are coming to the different messaging platforms that he/she uses; and 5.  end user 230 is able to search by keyword, name, date, etc., to find all desired messages.
<br/><br/> It can be appreciated that the approaches disclosed herein can be used within a computer system to integrate and allow searching of a plurality of electronic communications received from multiple communication platforms.  In this case, as shown
in FIGS. 1-2, the integration platform can be provided, and one or more systems for performing the processes described in the invention can be obtained and deployed to computer infrastructure 102 (FIG. 1).  To this extent, the deployment can comprise one
or more of (1) installing program code on a computing device, such as a computer system, from a computer-readable storage medium; (2) adding one or more computing devices to the infrastructure; and (3) incorporating and/or modifying one or more existing
systems of the infrastructure to enable the infrastructure to perform the process actions of the invention.
<br/><br/> The exemplary computer system 104 (FIG. 1) may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer.  Generally, program modules include routines, programs, people,
components, logic, data structures, and so on, which perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types.  Exemplary computer system 104 may be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote
processing devices that are linked through a communications network.  In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.
<br/><br/> As depicted in FIG. 3, a system (e.g., computer system 104) carries out the methodologies disclosed herein.  Shown is a process flow 300 for integrating and searching electronic communications received from a plurality of different communication
platforms.  At 302, each communication platform associated with an end user is registered.  At 304, electronic communications from a plurality of different communication platforms are received.  At 306, the electronic communications are compiled
according to an identity of a sender.  At 308, the electronic communications are stored on a client system.  At 310, a search of the electronic communications based on a keyword or the identity of the sender is enabled.
<br/><br/> Process flow 300 of FIG. 3 illustrates the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods, and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention.  In this regard, each
block in the flowchart may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s).  It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the
functions noted in the blocks might occur out of the order depicted in the figures.  For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently.  It will also be noted that each block of flowchart illustration can be
implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.
<br/><br/> Some of the functional components described in this specification have been labeled as systems or units in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence.  For example, a system or unit may be implemented as a hardware
circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components.  A system or unit may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable
gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.  A system or unit may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors.  A system or unit or component of executable code may, for instance,
comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions, which may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, or function.  Nevertheless, the executables of an identified system or unit need not be physically located together,
but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which, when joined logically together, comprise the system or unit and achieve the stated purpose for the system or unit.
<br/><br/> Further, a system or unit of executable code could be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices.  Similarly,
operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure.  The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be
distributed over different locations including over different storage devices and disparate memory devices.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, as will be described herein, systems/units may also be implemented as a combination of software and one or more hardware devices.  For instance, integration platform 118 may be embodied in the combination of a software executable
code stored on a memory medium (e.g., memory storage device).  In a further example, a system or unit may be the combination of a processor that operates on a set of operational data.
<br/><br/> As noted above, some of the embodiments may be embodied in hardware.  The hardware may be referenced as a hardware element.  In general, a hardware element may refer to any hardware structures arranged to perform certain operations.  In one
embodiment, for example, the hardware elements may include any analog or digital electrical or electronic elements fabricated on a substrate.  The fabrication may be performed using silicon-based integrated circuit (IC) techniques, such as complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), bipolar, and bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) techniques, for example.  Examples of hardware elements may include processors, microprocessors, circuits, circuit elements (e.g., transistors, resistors, capacitors, inductors, and so
forth), integrated circuits, application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), programmable logic devices (PLD), digital signal processors (DSP), field programmable gate array (FPGA), logic gates, registers, semiconductor devices, chips, microchips, chip
sets, and so forth.  However, the embodiments are not limited in this context.
<br/><br/> Also noted above, some embodiments may be embodied in software.  The software may be referenced as a software element.  In general, a software element may refer to any software structures arranged to perform certain operations.  In one
embodiment, for example, the software elements may include program instructions and/or data adapted for execution by a hardware element, such as a processor.  Program instructions may include an organized list of commands comprising words, values, or
symbols arranged in a predetermined syntax that, when executed, may cause a processor to perform a corresponding set of operations.
<br/><br/> For example, an implementation of exemplary computer system 104 (FIG. 1) may be stored on or transmitted across some form of computer-readable storage medium and/or computer-readable storage device.  Computer-readable storage medium/device can
be media that can be accessed by a computer.  "Computer-readable storage medium/device" includes volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable computer storable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as
computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data.  Computer storage device includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical
storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by a computer.  "Communication medium" typically
embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, and program modules.  Communication media also includes any information delivery media.
<br/><br/> It is apparent that there has been provided approaches for integrating and searching electronic communications received from a plurality of different communication platforms.  While the invention has been particularly shown and described in
conjunction with exemplary embodiments, it will be appreciated that variations and modifications will occur to those skilled in the art.  Therefore, it is to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes
that fall within the true spirit of the invention.
