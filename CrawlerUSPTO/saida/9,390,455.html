<br/><br/> 1.  Field
<br/><br/> This disclosure is generally related to determination of people prominence.  More specifically, this disclosure is related to a method for deriving a user's perceived importance of communication partners across multiple communication channels,
social networks, and contexts.
<br/><br/> 2.  Related Art
<br/><br/> The ubiquity of emails and the rapid development of social networks have greatly expanded an individual's realm of communications.  A person may find himself, on a daily basis, being bombarded with tens, even hundreds of communication messages,
including emails, instant messages, Facebook.TM.  posts, Twitter.TM.  tweets, phone calls, text messages, etc. Sifting through such a large number of messages for something relevant presents a challenge to the person.
<br/><br/> Many approaches have been adopted to help a user tackle this "information overload." For example, various email management schemes have been incorporated into commercially available email systems, such as Microsoft Outlook.TM.  (trademark of
Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.) or Eudora.RTM.  (registered trademark of Qualcomm Inc.  of San Diego, Calif.).  For example, a sender of an email can flag an email as important, and a recipient of emails can filter the received emails into
different folders based on various criteria, such as the sender of the email.  Moreover, some social network sites, such as <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> prioritize a user's list of friends base on streams of communication between the user and his friends within that social
network.  However, these schemes only apply to a single communication channel, neglecting the fact that a user often interacts with people over multiple communication channels.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> One embodiment of the present invention provides a system for evaluating contact priority for a user.  During operation, the system collects statistical information associated with interactions between the user and the user's contacts across
multiple communication channels, and evaluates the contact priority for a contact based at least on the collected statistical information.
<br/><br/> In a variation on this embodiment, the system further obtains cloud transitivity associated with the contact.
<br/><br/> In a further variation, evaluating the contact priority for the contact further involves calculating a priority factor based on the cloud transitivity associated with the contact.
<br/><br/> In a variation on this embodiment, the multiple communication channels include: face-to-face communications, offline communication channels, and online communication channels.
<br/><br/> In a variation on this embodiment, the statistical information associated with the interactions between the user and the user's contacts includes frequencies and/or durations of the interactions.
<br/><br/> In a further variation, evaluating the contact priority for the contact involves ranking the contact among the user's contacts based on the frequencies and/or the durations of the interactions.
<br/><br/> In a variation on this embodiment, the contact priority has a binary value.
<br/><br/> In a variation on this embodiment, the contact priority has a numerical value ranging between 0 and 1. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the embodiments, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements.  Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments
will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.  Thus, the present invention is
not limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.
<br/><br/> Overview
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the present invention provide a method and a system for deriving a user's perceived priority of communication partners across multiple communication channels.  The system calculates a person's priority in relation to the user
based on a number of factors, including the amount of time the person spent with the user, the amount and frequency of online/offline communications between the person and the user, and the number of other "important" persons who have also perceived this
person as important.
<br/><br/> Unified Contact Priority
<br/><br/> In order to assist a user in dealing with the information overload, many different approaches have been developed to differentiate among the large number of communication messages received by the user.  Some email prioritizing techniques either
rely on a priority flag set by the email sender or use a complex model to derive message importance.
<br/><br/> One approach to differentiate among the messages is based on the importance of the originator or sender of the message.  For example, if it is determined that a particular email received by a user is sent by his mother, who is of significant
importance to the user, then this particular email can be determined to be important.  Hence, it is important to have a system capable of deriving people priority.
<br/><br/> Existing social networks have provided solutions to rank a user's contacts/friends by their priority for the user.  However, these existing contact-priority-ranking solutions calculate the priority of a contact/friend only based on communication
streams or connections between the contact/friend and the user within the realm of a particular social networking site, without integrating with other types of communication streams (such as emails or posts on a different social networking site),
real-world communications (such as phone calls), and physical contexts.  Hence, these contact-priority-ranking solutions can be flawed.  For example, a user's mother, although being an important person in a user's life, may very rarely visit the user's
social networking page, thus being ranked as a person of less importance to the user based on a contact-priority-ranking algorithm run by the social network site.  Such an algorithm may cause the user to ignore a message posted by his mother on his
social networking page.
<br/><br/> In embodiments of the present invention, when deriving a contact's priority as perceived by the user, a number of factors associated with different modalities are considered, including the time spent together, multiple online/offline
communication streams, and the cloud transitivity.  In other words, all aspects of interaction between the user and his contacts are considered.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 presents a diagram illustrating the various channels over which a user interacts with his contact, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In FIG. 1, a user 102 interacts with a number of his contact persons, such as
contacts 104, 106, and 108.  The interaction between user 102 and contact 104 is a direct physical interaction, such as a face-to-face meeting.  User 102 interacts with contact 106 over various online communication channels, including, but not limited
to: emails, instant messages, and various social network sites.  In addition, user 102 interacts with user 108 using a real-world communication channel, such as mobile phones or fixed phones.  Note that although FIG. 1 illustrates user 102 interacting
with each contact over a different communication channel, in practice, user 102 often interacts with a contact over multiple communication channels, and a particular communication channel can also be used by user 102 to interact with multiple contacts. 
For example, in addition to face-to-face meetings, user 102 can also interact with contact 104 via online communications or phone calls.  Similarly, in addition to having phone conversations with contact 108, user 102 can also communicate with contacts
104 and 106 over the phone.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 presents a diagram illustrating a contact-priority evaluation system, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  Contact-priority evaluation system 200 includes a physical-context collector 202, a communication
consolidator 204, a cloud-transitivity evaluator 206, and a priority calculator 208.
<br/><br/> Physical-context collector 202 collects physical context associated with the user and his contacts.  Note that the physical context includes information associated with direct physical interactions between the user and his contact person.  For
example, the user and his contact person may have a scheduled face-to-face meeting, or they may have a casual, unscheduled chat.  In addition, being in the vicinity of each other, such as attending an activity (such as a conference or a party) together,
although without direct verbal interaction, may also signal importance.  Various techniques can be used to collect physical context.  For example, physical-context collector 202 can access the user's electronic calendar (or calendars if the user
maintains multiple calendars) in order to collect information associated with scheduled meetings.  In addition, physical-context collector 202 can also interact with certain people-sensing systems that sense proximity of other people associated with the
user.  For example, a user's mobile phone may be configured to detect the presence of other mobile phones, which correspond to the presence of other people.
<br/><br/> Communication consolidator 204 monitors and consolidates the user's online and offline communication with his contacts.  Forms of online communication include, but are not limited to: email, instant messaging (IM), interactions (such as posts or
comments) on social networking websites, web conferencing, etc. Forms of offline communications include, but not limited to: telephone calls (which involve either a landline telephone or a mobile phone) and Short Message Service (SMS) text messaging.
<br/><br/> Cloud-transitivity evaluator 206 interacts with contact-priority evaluation systems associated with other users in order to extract the cloud-transitivity for a particular contact.  Note that the cloud-transitivity of a particular contact is
defined as the number of "important" contacts that perceive this particular contact as "important."
<br/><br/> The outputs of physical-context collector 202, communication consolidator 204, and cloud-transitivity evaluator 206 are sent to priority calculator 208, which calculates a unified contact priority based on the physical context and those
aforementioned multiple communication channels.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the contact priority is a binary variable with "1" indicating a contact being "important" and "0" indicating otherwise.  In a further embodiment, the binary contact priority for a contact "P" can be formulated as: Priority
(P)=T(P) AND F(P) AND O(P) AND C(P), (1) where T(P) is a binary variable that measures the time priority, F(P) a binary variable that measures the offline-communication priority, O(P) a binary variable that measures online-communication priority, and
C(P) a binary variable that measures cloud-transitivity priority.  Note that the AND log operations ensure that a contact will be perceived as important only if all four priority measures return "true."
<br/><br/> More specifically, time priority T(P) can be calculated as: T(P)=((f.sub.1(P)/N&lt;.theta..sub.1) AND (f.sub.2(P)/N&lt;.theta..sub.2)) OR ((f.sub.3(P)/N&lt;.theta..sub.3) AND (f.sub.4(P)/N&lt;.theta..sub.4)).  (2) Offline-communication priority
F(P) can be calculated as: F(P)=(f.sub.5(P)/N&lt;.theta..sub.5) AND (f.sub.6(P)/N&lt;.theta..sub.6).  (3) Online-communication priority O(P) can be calculated as: O(P)=S.sub.1(P) OR S.sub.2(P) .  . . OR S.sub.i(P) .  . . OR S.sub.n(P),
S.sub.i(P)=(f.sub.7(P)/N&lt;.theta..sub.7) AND (f.sub.8(P)/N&lt;.theta..sub.7) AND (f.sub.9(P)/N&lt;.theta..sub.7) where AND (f.sub.10(P)/N&lt;.theta..sub.7) AND (f.sub.11(P)/N&lt;.theta..sub.7).  AND (f.sub.12(P)/N&lt;.theta..sub.7) AND
(f.sub.13(P)/N&lt;.theta..sub.time) (4) Cloud-transitivity priority C(P) can be calculated as: C(P)=f.sub.14(P)/N.sub.imp&gt;.theta..sub.8.  (5) In Eqs.  (2)-(5) N is the number of user contacts, N.sub.imp is the number of important user contacts,
f.sub.1(P) through f.sub.14 (P) are various ranking variables that describe how contact P ranks among all user contacts over different categories (such as time spent together with the user), and .theta..sub.1-.theta..sub.8 and .theta..sub.time are the
different threshold values to be set for the variables such that they determine what rank (in term of percentage) qualifies as being important for each category.
<br/><br/> The different ranking variables are explained in detail below.  f.sub.1(P) ranks contact P based on the amount of time the user spent for scheduled meetings that include contact P; f.sub.2(P) ranks contact P based on the occurrence frequency of
the user's scheduled meetings that include contact P; f.sub.3(P) ranks contact P based on the amount of time the user spent in the vicinity of contact P; f.sub.4(P) ranks contact P based on the occurrence frequency of the user being in the vicinity of
contact P; f.sub.5(P) ranks contact P based on the amount of time the user spent on offline/telephone communications with contact P; f.sub.6(P) ranks contact P based on the occurrence frequency of the offline/telephone communications between the user and
contact P; f.sub.7(P) ranks contact P based on the number of all unfiltered online conversations/interactions that include both the user and contact P; f.sub.8 (P) ranks contact P based on the number of online conversations/interactions that are
contributed by the user and include contact P; f.sub.9 (P) ranks contact P based on the number of emails sent from the user to contact P; f.sub.10(P) ranks contact P based on the number of reply emails (emails sent as replies to previous emails) sent
from the user to contact P; f.sub.11(P) ranks contact P based on the number of emails sent from contact P to the user; f.sub.12(P) ranks contact P based on the number of reply emails sent from contact P to the user; f.sub.13(P) ranks contact P based on
the number of days since the last email has been received from or sent to contact P by the user; and f.sub.14(P) ranks contact P based on the number of the user's important contacts (contacts who have been flagged by the user as important) who have also
flagged contact P as important.
<br/><br/> Note that, in Eq.  (4), each S(P) calculates an online-communication priority function for a particular time interval.  Hence, the corresponding ranking variables (f.sub.7(P) through f.sub.13(P)) for a particular S(P) are determined for that
particular time interval.  Also note that these priority functions may or may not overlap in time.  Calculating a priority function for different time intervals is important because a user's online communications with a particular contact may be bursty
in nature.  For example, a temporary project may result in the user interacting with someone intensively over a brief time interval.  Such bursts may be ignored if these communications are averaged over a long period.
<br/><br/> The various thresholds (.theta..sub.1-.theta..sub.8 and .theta..sub.time) can either be set manually by the user or be set to a default value by the system.  In one embodiment, .theta..sub.1-.theta..sub.8 are set to the same percentage value
(such as 10%).  In one embodiment, .theta..sub.1-.theta..sub.8 are set to different percentage values.
<br/><br/> In addition to using Eqs.  (1)-(5) to derive contact priorities, in one embodiment, the system also allows a user to manually set contact priorities.  For example, the user can go through his contact list and manually flag a contact as
important.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, instead of being a binary variable, contact priorities can also be expressed by numeric values, where a larger number indicates a higher priority.  In one embodiment, the numeric contact priority can be calculated as:
Priority*(P)=MAX[.alpha..sub.1*(P), .alpha..sub.2F*(P), .alpha..sub.3 O*(P), .alpha..sub.4C*(P], (6) where Priority*(P) is the numeric overall contact priority, T*(P) the numeric time priority, F*(P) the numeric offline-communication priority, O*(P) the
numeric online-communication priority, C*(P) the numeric cloud-transitivity priority, and .alpha..sub.1 through .alpha..sub.4 are weight variables defining the influence of each priority value on the overall priority value.
<br/><br/> The various numeric priorities, T*(P), F*(P), O*(P), and C*(P), can be calculated separately as: T*(P)=MAX{MIN[.alpha..sub.5(1-f.sub.1(P)/N, .alpha..sub.6(1-f.sub.2(P)/N], MIN[.alpha..sub.7(1-f.sub.3(P)/N, .alpha..sub.8(1-f.sub.4(P)/N]} (7)
F*(P)=MIN[.alpha..sub.9(1-f.sub.5(P)/N, .alpha..sub.10(1-f.sub.6(P)/N]; (8) O*(P)=MAX[o.sub.1S*.sub.1(P), .  . . o.sub.jS*.sub.j(P), .  . . o.sub.nS*.sub.n(P)], S*.sub.j(P)=MIN[.beta..sub.j1f.sub.7(P)/N, .beta..sub.j2f.sub.8(P)/N,
.beta..sub.j3f.sub.9(P)/N, .beta..sub.j4f.sub.10(P)/N, where .beta..sub.j5f.sub.11(P)/N, .beta..sub.j6f.sub.12(P)/N]*MAX[(1-f.sub.13(P)/.theta..sub.time), 0.0] (9) and C*(P)=f.sub.14(P)/N.sub.imp.  (10) Note that Eqs.  (7)-(10) and Eqs.  (2)-(5) share a
number of common variables, such as N, N.sub.imp, ranking variables f.sub.1(P) through f.sub.13(P), f.sub.14(P), and time threshold .theta..sub.time.  In addition, Eqs.  (7)-(10) include a number of weight variables, such as .alpha..sub.1, .  . . ,
.alpha..sub.10, 0.sub.1, .  . . , o.sub.n, .beta..sub.11, .  . . , .beta..sub.n6, having values between 0 and 1.  These weight variables can be used to define the influence of each factor and sub-factor to the overall priority value.  In one embodiment,
the system allows the user to manually set these weight variables.  For example, a user may consider his online activities more important, hence setting .alpha..sub.3 at a higher value, such as 1.
<br/><br/> Note that the aforementioned priority-evaluation equations (Eqs.  (1)-(10)) are merely exemplary and should not limit the scope of this disclosure.  In general, embodiments of the present invention provide a method that calculates a unified
contact priority across multiple communication channels.  The exact expression of the contact priority can be different from Eqs.  (1)-(10).  For example, instead of calculating a contact priority by ranking the contact among all user contacts, the
system may calculate a contact priority using the volume of the communications (such as number of emails).
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 presents a flow chart illustrating the process of evaluating a contact's priority, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  During operation, the priority-evaluation system collects statistical information associated
with interactions between the user and the user's contacts (operation 302).  In one embodiment, the interactions between the user and his contacts include, but are not limited to: direct physical interactions, offline (telephone) communications, and
online communications.  Subsequently, for each user contact, the system calculates a priority factor associated with the user-user contact interactions (operation 304).  In one embodiment, the system calculates a priority sub-factor for each type of
user-user contact interaction.  For example, the system may calculate a priority sub-factor based on direct physical interaction between the user and his contact.  The system further evaluates the cloud transitivity corresponding to each user contact
(operation 306), and calculates a priority factor associated with the cloud transitivity (operation 308).  In one embodiment, the system interacts with priority-evaluation systems belonging to other users in order to obtain cloud transitivity.  The
system then determines the final priority for a contact based on the priority factor associated with the user-user contact interactions and the priority factor associated with the cloud transitivity (operation 310).  In one embodiment, the final contact
priority is expressed as a binary value (important or unimportant).  In one more embodiment, the final contact priority is expressed by a numerical value between 1 and 0.
<br/><br/> User Interface and Computer System
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 presents a diagram illustrating an exemplary graphical user interface (GUI), in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  GUI 400 includes a contact field 402.  Contact field 402 includes a number of entries, such as
entries 404, 406, and 408, with each entry corresponding to a particular contact.  For example, entry 404 corresponds to a user contact named "John Doe." In addition to the contact name, each entry also includes a priority field.  For example, entry 404
includes a priority field 410.  The priority field indicates the priority value of the corresponding contact.  In the example shown in FIG. 4, the priority field includes a numeric number ranging between 0 and 1, with a larger number corresponding to a
higher priority.  In one embodiment, the system highlights contact entries having a priority value higher than a threshold, thus making it easier for the user to identify important contacts.  In the example shown in FIG. 4, any contacts with priority
value higher than 0.5 are highlighted.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the system allows the user to manually enter a contact priority value.  For example, when the user attempts to set the priority for contact "Ben Scott," the user can either directly fill in a number in the priority field or
select an entry from a drop-down menu 412.  In the example shown in FIG. 4, by selecting the entry "Let the System Decide," the user delegates the system to calculate a priority value for the contact.  Other entries included in drop-down menu 412 allow
the user to manually set the contact as "important" or "unimportant."
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary computer system for evaluating a contact's priority in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.  In one embodiment, a computer and communication system 500 includes a processor 502, a memory 504,
and a storage device 506.  Storage device 506 stores a contact-priority evaluation application 508, as well as other applications, such as applications 510 and 512.  During operation, contact-priority evaluation application 508 is loaded from storage
device 506 into memory 504 and then executed by processor 502.  While executing the program, processor 502 performs the aforementioned functions.  Computer and communication system 500 is coupled to an optional display 514, keyboard 516, and pointing
device 518.
