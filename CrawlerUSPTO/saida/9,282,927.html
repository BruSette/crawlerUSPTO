<br/><br/> Operation 2304 illustrates selecting the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partially based on at least one demographic characteristic of the at least one individual.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may
select the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partially based on at least one demographic characteristic of the at least one individual.  In one example, selector module 106 can select an artificial sensory experience based on a
demographic characteristic the at least one individual.  A demographic characteristic may include a socioeconomic, age, gender, and/or other similar factor defining a certain population.  For example, selector module 106 and/or system 100 may select a
virtual reality experience such as a Sesame Street or Disney-themed experience as the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partially based on an indication that the individual is aged 6-10 years old.  In some instances, selector module 106
may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 2306 illustrates selecting the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partially based on at least one of geographic Location, family status, age, gender, weight, ethnicity, body mass index, household size, or
income of the at least one individual.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partially based on at least one of geographic location, family status, age, gender, weight,
ethnicity, body mass index, household size, or income of the at least one individual.  In one example, selector module 106 can select the artificial sensory experience based on an age and a weight associated with the at least one individual.  A
geographic location may include a location where an individual currently resides, has resided in the past, and/or has visited.  A family status may include marital status, status and/or presence of children, and/or the status and/or health of extended
family.  In some instances, selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 24 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 200 of FIG. 2.  FIG. 24 illustrates example embodiments where operation 230 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include an
operation 2402, and/or an operation 2404.
<br/><br/> Operation 2402 illustrates selecting the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partially based on at least one of a medication history or an artificial sensory experience history of the at least one individual.  For example, as
shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partially based on at least one of a medication history or an artificial sensory experience history of the at least one individual.  In one instance,
selector module 106 can select an artificial sensory experience based on an artificial sensory experience history of the at least one individual.  An artificial sensory experience history may include any record of at least one administered artificial
sensory experience history.  For example, system 100 and/or selector module 106 may select a modified <b><i>facebook</i></b> webpage having a cheerful color scheme at least partly based on a <b><i>facebook</i></b> usage history for an individual with signs of depression.  In some
instances, selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Operation 2404 illustrates selecting a preferred artificial sensory experience and at least one alternative artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select a preferred artificial sensory experience
and at least one alternative artificial sensory experience.  In one example, selector module 106 can select a preferred artificial sensory experience and at least one alternative artificial sensory experience.  A preferred artificial sensory experience
may include a more desirable artificial sensory experience due to a lack of and/or a reduced level of side effects, reduced impact upon the individual, and/or increased compatibility with another medications and/or treatment.  An alternative artificial
sensory experience may include any artificial sensory experience in addition to the preferred artificial sensory experience and may be less desirable than the preferred artificial sensory experience due to side effects and/or increased impact upon the
individual.  In some instances, selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 25 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 200 of FIG. 2.  FIG. 25 illustrates example embodiments where operation 230 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include an
operation 2502, an operation 2504, and/or an operation 2506.
<br/><br/> Operation 2502 illustrates selecting at least one artificial sensory experience and at least one prescription medication at least partially based on a treatment algorithm.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select at least
one artificial sensory experience and at least one prescription medication at least partially based on a treatment algorithm.  In one instance, selector module 106 can select an artificial sensory experience and a prescription medication based on a
computer software treatment algorithm.  A treatment algorithm may include any computation, formula, statistical survey, and/or look-up table for determining and/or selecting a suitable artificial sensory experience and prescription medication
combination.  Some examples may include a computer software algorithm, a calculator, a flowchart, and/or a decision tree.  For example, system 100 and/or selector module 106 may, based on an accepted pain symptom of an individual, access a lookup chart
that matches the pain symptom with a pain medication, such as naproxen, and a virtual experience, such as World of Warcraft.  Such a combination therapy may be particularly effective in ameliorating the pain symptom in the individual.  In some instances,
selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 2504 illustrates selecting at least one prescription medication at least partially based on at least one of a drug allergy associated with the at least one individual or a drug interaction associated with the at least one
prescription medication.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select at least one prescription medication at least partially based on at least one of a drug allergy associated with the at least one individual or a drug interaction
associated with the at least one prescription medication.  In one example, selector module 106 can select a prescription medication based on a drug allergy associated with the at least one individual.  A drug allergy may include any allergy to a drug
and/or drug intolerance.  Some examples of a drug allergy may include penicillin allergies, codeine allergies, and/or allergies to a dye in a drug.  A drug interaction may include an undesirable and/or unwanted reaction between two or more drugs and/or
medications.  For example, the system 100 and/or selector module 106 can select a prescription medication other than those that might cause a side effect in an individual, perhaps because of a known predisposition to the side effect (e.g., an allergy) or
because of a known drug-drug interaction relevant to the individual based on the individual's medication regimen.  In this way, risk of side effects can be lessened.  In some instances, selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Operation 2506 illustrates selecting at least one opioid analgesic and at least one virtual world experience to address at least one pain attribute of at least one individual.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select from
a prescription medication database at least one opioid analgesic and at least one virtual world experience to address at least one pain attribute of at least one individual.  In one example, selector module 106 can select an opioid analgesic including
morphine and a virtual world experience including an online game to address a pain attribute of at least one individual named Mary Andersen.  In some instances, selector module 106 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 26 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 200 of FIG. 2.  FIG. 26 illustrates example embodiments where operation 240 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include an
operation 2602, an operation 2604, and/or an operation 2606.
<br/><br/> Operation 2602 illustrates presenting an indication of a preferred combination including at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience and at least one alternative combination including at least one
alternative prescription medication and at least one alternative artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, presenter module 108 may present an indication of a preferred combination including at least one prescription medication and
at least one artificial sensory experience and at least one alternative combination including at least one alternative prescription medication and at least one alternative artificial sensory experience.  In one instance, presenter module 108 can present
an indication of a preferred combination to an individual 134 including a prescription medication and an artificial sensory experience along with an alternative combination including an alternative prescription medication and an alternative artificial
sensory experience.  Individual 134 may include a single individual, multiple individuals, and/or an entity.  A preferred combination may include a more desirable combination due to a lack of and/or a reduced number of and/or level of side effects,
reduced impact upon the administered individual, and/or increased compatibility with another medications and/or treatment.  An alternative combination may include any combination in addition to the preferred combination and may be ostensibly less
desirable than the preferred artificial sensory experience because of a potential side effect and/or impact upon the administered individual.  Presentation of alternative combinations may provide benefits to the individual in terms of accessibility,
affordability, and/or personal preference of medication and/or artificial sensory experience.  In some instances, presenter module 108 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Operation 2604 illustrates presenting an indication of the at least one prescription medication and the at least one artificial sensory experience to at least one output device.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, presenter module 108 may present
an indication of the at least one prescription medication and the at least one artificial sensory experience to at least one output device.  In one example, presenter module 108 can present an indication of a prescription medication and an artificial
sensory experience to an output device 130 including a printer at a health clinic.  An output device may include any hardware device configured for receiving computer output.  Some examples of an output device may include a printer, a monitor, a mobile

operation 2802, and/or an operation 2804.
<br/><br/> Operation 2802 illustrates presenting to a health care provider an indication of at least one of the at least one prescription medication or the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the selecting at least one
prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, presenter module 108 may present to a health care provider an indication of at
least one of the at least one prescription medication or the at least one artificial sensory experience at least partly based on the selecting at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience to address an attribute of
an individual.  In one example, presenter module 108 can present to a health care provider 128 an indication of a prescription medication based on the selecting at least one prescription medication and at least one artificial sensory experience to
address the at least one attribute 120 of at least one individual.  A health care provider may include a pharmacy, a pharmaceutical company, a medical device company, a research institution, a computer software and/or computer hardware company, a
website, a nurse and/or a physician.  In some instances, presenter module 108 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Operation 2804 illustrates presenting an indication of the at Least one prescription medication or the at least one artificial sensory experience at a staggered time.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, presenter module 108 may present an
indication of at least one of the at least one prescription medication or the at least one artificial sensory experience at a staggered time.  In one example, presenter module 108 can present an indication of a series of prescription medications and an
artificial sensory experience at staggered times.  A staggered time may include presenting an indication of the at least one drug and/or artificial sensory experience at overlapping times and/or at different times, including alternating times.  For
example, at least one drug and an artificial sensory experience may be administered at an initial time and the same or a different drug may be administered when the first-administered at least one drug is at its peak effect.  In another example, at least
one drug and an artificial sensory experience may be administered at an initial time and the same or a different drug may be administered when the first administered at least one drug is at its lowest effect.  In another example, an artificial sensory
experience may be administered at an initial time and at least one prescription medication at a later time.  The at least one artificial sensory experience and/or the at least one prescription medication may be administered at any number of times either
concurrently, partially concurrently, or not concurrently.  In some instances, presenter module 108 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 29 illustrates an operational flow 2900 representing example operations related to querying at least one database at least partly based on at least one attribute of an individual, selecting from the at least one database at least one
prescription medication to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual, and/or implementing at least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual in response to a selected at least
one prescription medication.  In FIG. 29, discussion and explanation may be provided with respect to the above-described examples of FIG. 1, and/or with respect to other examples and contexts.  However, it should be understood that the operational flows
may be executed in a number of other environments and contexts, and/or in modified versions of FIG. 1.  Also, although the various operational flows are presented in the sequence(s) illustrated, it should be understood that the various operations may be
performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently.
<br/><br/> After a start operation, the operational flow 2900 moves to an operation 2910.  Operation 2910 depicts querying at least one database at least partly based on at least one attribute of an individual.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, querier
module 104 may search at least one database at least partly based on at least one attribute of an individual.  In one instance, querier module 104 may search medication database 124 and artificial sensory experience database 126 based on an attribute 120
including an indication of hypertension associated with an individual named John Smith.  In some instances, querier module 104 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Then, operation 2920 depicts selecting from the at least one database at least one prescription medication to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual.  For example, as shown in FIG. 1, selector module 106 may select from
the at least one database at least one prescription medication to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual.  In one example and continuing with the previous example, selector module 106 may select from medication database 124 and
artificial sensory experience database 126 a prescription medicine for addressing the attribute 120 including an indication of hypertension associated with an individual named John Smith.  In some instances, selector module 106 may include a computer
processor.
<br/><br/> Then, operation 2930 depicts implementing at least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual in response to a selected at least one prescription medication.  For example, as shown in FIG.
1, implementer module 138 may implement at least one artificial sensory experience to address the at least one attribute of at least one individual in response to a selected at least one prescription medication.  In one instance and continuing with the
previous example, implementer module 106 may implement an artificial sensory experience including a virtual world for addressing the attribute 120 including an indication of hypertension associated with an individual named John Smith in response to a
selected prescription medication from a medication database 124.  In some instances, selector module 106 may include a computer processor.

<br/><br/> FIG. 36 illustrates an operational flow 3600 representing example operations related to measuring at least one effect of a combined bioactive agent and artificial sensory experience on an individual and modifying at least one of the bioactive
agent or the artificial sensory experience at least partially based on the at least one effect.  In FIG. 36 and in following figures that include various examples of operational flows, discussion and explanation may be provided with respect to the
above-described examples of FIGS. 32 through 35, and/or with respect to other examples and contexts.  However, it should be understood that the operational flows may be executed in a number of other environments and contexts, and/or in modified versions
of FIGS. 32 through 35.  Also, although the various operational flows are presented in the sequence(s) illustrated, it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed
concurrently.
<br/><br/> After a start operation, the operational flow 3600 moves to operation 3610.  Operation 3610 depicts measuring at least one effect of a combined bioactive agent and artificial sensory experience on an individual.  For example, as shown in FIGS.
32 through 35, measurer module 3402 may measure an effect of a combined bioactive agent and artificial sensory experience on an individual.  Some examples of measuring an effect may include requesting and/or accepting one or more laboratory test results,
for example a blood test; measuring one or more physiologic effects, such as heart rate; and/or measuring brain activity and/or function.  Additional examples of measuring an effect may include using medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging
and/or computed tomography.  An effect may include a side effect and/or a desired effect.  In some instances, measurer module 3402 may include a computer processor and/or a medical device.
<br/><br/> Then, operation 3620 depicts modifying at least one of the bioactive agent or the artificial sensory experience at least partially based on the at least one effect.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, the modifier module 3418 may
modify a bioactive agent and/or an artificial sensory experience at least partially based on an effect of the combined bioactive agent and artificial sensory experience.  In one instance, modifier module 3418 may modify a virtual world in response to a
measured effect of the bioactive agent.  Some examples of a bioactive agent may include a prescription medication, nutraceutical, and/or dietary supplement.  Some examples of modifying a bioactive agent may include changing a bioactive agent dosage,
modifying a bioactive agent administration method, adding a supplemental bioactive agent; and/or changing the bioactive agent to another bioactive agent.  Some examples of an artificial sensory experience may include a virtual experience, such as an
online game or a social networking site, and/or a real-world sensory stimulus, such as a smell and/or a sight.  Examples of modifying an artificial sensory experience may include changing a computer game and/or changing a computer display background
content and/or emission setting.  One example of administering an artificial sensory experience may include a game utilizing a neuroheadset having sensors for detecting mental state based on, for example, electrical signals and/or blood flow in the
brain.  See, for example, headsets manufactured by Emotiv Systems, Inc.  In some instances, modifier module 3418 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 37 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 3600 of FIG. 36.  FIG. 37 illustrates example embodiments where operation 3610 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include
operation 3702, operation 3704, and/or operation 3706.
<br/><br/> Operation 3702 illustrates comparing empirical data with a current effect measurement.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, data comparer module 3404 may compare empirical data with a current effect measurement.  In one instance, data
comparer module 3404 may compare a set of previous experimental data with a current effect measurement, such as a pulse measurement.  Empirical data may include data obtained from experimentation and/or observation.  Some examples of empirical data may
include results from a clinical trial and/or data collection from medical records, e.g., data obtained through data mining.  Further discussion regarding data mining may be found in Oren et al., U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,807,492, which is incorporated herein by
reference.  Additionally, empirical data may be obtained through a lab information system (LIS), such as the system discussed in Birkner et al., U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,826,498, which is incorporated herein by reference.  In some instances, data comparer
module 3404 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Operation 3704 illustrates measuring the at least one effect at least one of during or after the individual experiences the combined bioactive agent and artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, measurer
module 3402 may measure an effect during or after an individual experiences the combined bioactive agent and artificial sensory experience.  The effect may be measured using, for example, a medical device, a laboratory testing protocol, and/or a
physician's observation.  The effect may be measured during and/or after administration of an artificial sensory experience and bioactive agent combination for comparing one or more effects of the combination at different times and/or compared to one or
more pre-administration measurements.  In one embodiment, measurer module 3402 may measure an individual's blood pressure during and after administration of a combination artificial sensory experience and bioactive agent and compare the different
measurements to determine the extent of the combination effect on the individual.  In some instances, measurer module 3402 may include a computer processor, a medical device, and/or a combination of a computer processor and medical device.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 3706 illustrates utilizing at least one laboratory test to measure the at least one effect.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, laboratory test utilizer module 3406 may utilize a laboratory test to measure the
effect.  A laboratory test may include, for example, a design of experiments test (e.g., a test where one or more parameters is changed to observe the effect the changes have on one or more response variables), a blood test, a DNA analysis test, a
toxicology test, a urinalysis, and/or a histopathological test.  Such tests may serve to determine the effect of a combination bioactive agent and artificial sensory experience on an individual.  In some instances, laboratory test utilizer module 3406
may include a computer processor and/or medical instrumentation.
<br/><br/> FIG. 38 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 3600 of FIG. 36.  FIG. 38 illustrates example embodiments where operation 3610 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include
operation 3802, operation 3804, and/or operation 3806.
<br/><br/> Operation 3802 illustrates measuring the at least one effect with a self assessment.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, self assessment measurer module 3408 may measure an effect with a self assessment.  A self assessment may include
a judgment by the individual regarding the individual's own condition.  In one embodiment, the individual may input into self assessment measurer module 3408 an indication of a level of pain being experienced.  The individual may input an indication of
pain using a pain scale, such as a Faces Pain Scale (FPS) and/or a Pediatric Pain Questionnaire (PPQ).  In some instances, self assessment measurer module 3408 may include a computer processor and/or an input device, such as a touchscreen display.
<br/><br/> Operation 3804 illustrates measuring the at least one effect with a computerized assessment.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, computerized assessment measurer module 3410 may measure the at least one effect with a computerized
assessment.  A computerized assessment may include, for example, inputting and/or receiving an indication of at least one effect and computationally determining the existence and/or extent of an effect.  One example of a cognitive assessment tool may
include inputting patient information, recommending a battery of tests, administering the tests, and/or processing the test results.  Further discussion regarding a cognitive assessment tool may be found in Simon et al., U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,294,107, which
is incorporated herein by reference.  In some instances, computerized assessment measurer module 3410 may include a computer processor, an input device, and/or medical instrumentation.  Further, operation 3806 illustrates measuring the at least one
effect with a virtual experience score.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, virtual experience score measurer module 3412 may measure an effect with a virtual experience score.  In one embodiment, virtual experience score measurer module 3412
may measure an effect of a combination antianxiety medication combined with a virtual experience, such as a World of Warcraft game.  In this embodiment, a low score may indicate efficacy of the antianxiety medication administration.  In some instances,
virtual experience score measurer module 3412 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 39 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 3600 of FIG. 36.  FIG. 39 illustrates example embodiments where the operation 3610 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include
operation 3902, and/or operation 3904.
<br/><br/> Operation 3902 illustrates measuring an expected behavior.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, expected behavior measurer module 3414 may measure an expected behavior.  An expected behavior may include a behavior that is expected
and/or predicted to occur.  One example of measuring an expected behavior may include measuring an individual's pulse during administration and/or bioavailability of an antianxiety medication to an individual and while the individual is engaged with an
artificial sensory experience.  In this example, an expected behavior may include a decrease in pulse proximate to administration of the medication and engagement with the artificial sensory experience.  Another example of measuring an expected behavior
may include measuring an individual's pain while she is being administered an opioid and experiencing an artificial sensory experience as a means for distraction.  In this example, an expected behavior may be a reduction in pain due to the effects of the
opioid and the artificial sensory experience.  In some instances, expected behavior measurer module 3414 may include a computer processor and/or medical instrumentation.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 3904 illustrates comparing current measured behavior data with expected behavior data.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, behavior data comparer module 3416 may compare current measured behavior data with expected
behavior data.  Current measured behavior data may include data obtained and/or measured from the most recent occurrence of administering a combination bioactive agent and artificial sensory experience to an individual.  Expected behavior data may
include previous measurements from the individual and/or a separate group of people with similar characteristics.  Expected behavior data may also include, for example, statistical treatments of historical response data, such as average response measures
for an individual and/or for a group of individuals.  In some instances, behavior data comparer module 3416 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 40 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 3600 of FIG. 36.  FIG. 40 illustrates example embodiments where operation 3620 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include
operation 4002, operation 4004, and/or operation 4006.
<br/><br/> Operation 4002 illustrates modifying access to at least a portion of the artificial sensory experience to alter at least one effect of the bioactive agent.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, access modifier module 3420 may modify
access to a portion of the artificial sensory experience to alter at least one effect of the bioactive agent.  In one instance, access modifier module 3420 may modify access to a portion of an artificial sensory experience including a photo gallery
portion of a social networking website to alter at least one effect of a bioactive agent such as an antidepressant.  Such modified access may function therapeutically to prevent access of an individual to potentially depressing, stressful, or otherwise
triggering sensory experiences, and/or the modified access may involve presentation of a sensory experience that affirmatively improves a condition (e.g., bright sunny images for a clinically depressed individual).  In some instances, access modifier
module 3420 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 4004 illustrates restricting access to at least a portion of the artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, access restrictor module 3422 may restrict access to at least a portion of the
artificial sensory experience.  In one instance, access restrictor module 3422 may restrict access to a portion of a virtual world designed to overcome a flying phobia, where access to a portion of a simulated flying experience is prevented, for example,
a jet take-off portion.  In this instance, the most stressful portion of the flight simulation may be avoided.  In some instances, access restrictor module 3422 may include a computer processor.  Further, operation 4006 illustrates granting access to at
least a portion of the artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, access granter module 3424 may grant access to at least a portion of the artificial sensory experience.  In one instance and continuing with the above
example, access granter module 3424 may grant access to at least a portion of a virtual world designed to overcome a flying phobia, where access to a portion of a simulated flying experience is granted, including a jet landing portion.  Such a simulation
presenting gradually increasing contact with the object of the fear may serve to provide conditioning for the individual to eventually overcome the phobia.  In some instances, access granter module 3424 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 41 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 3600 of FIG. 36.  FIG. 41 illustrates example embodiments where operation 3620 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include
operation 4102, operation 4104, and/or operation 4106.
<br/><br/> Operation 4102 illustrates modifying a visual object in an artificial sensory experience to alter at least one effect of the bioactive agent.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, visual object modifier module 3426 may modify a visual
object in an artificial sensory experience to alter at least one effect of the bioactive agent.  In one instance and continuing with the above example, visual object modifier module 3426 may modify a visual object, such as adding window covers over the
windows of a virtual plane in a virtual world designed to overcome a flying phobia to alter at least one effect of an anti-anxiety medication.  In this example, the window covers may reduce anxiety experienced by the individual in addition to anxiety
reduction mediated by the anti-anxiety medication.  Additional examples of a visual object may include a virtual character (i.e., an avatar), an action performed by the avatar, and/or character attribute and/or artifact, such as facial features, weapons,
clothing, and/or tools.  In some instances, visual object modifier module 3426 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Further, operation 4104 illustrates modifying a color scheme of an artificial sensory experience to alter at least one effect of the bioactive agent.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, color scheme modifier module 3428 may modify a
color scheme of an artificial sensory experience to alter at least one effect of the bioactive agent.  In one instance, color scheme modifier module 3428 may modify a color scheme by adding brighter background tights and colors in a virtual world
designed to overcome depression to alter an effect of an anti-depression medication.  Such a color scheme modification may help to overcome depression, seasonal affective disorder, and/or other disorders because it has been purported that color and/or
light may affect nonvisual psychological processes.  Discussion regarding the effects of color and/or Light on nonvisual psychological processes may be found in Knez, Effects of colour of light on nonvisual psychological processes, JOURNAL OF
ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY, 21(2):201-208 (2001); M. R Basso Jr., Neurobiological relationships between ambient lighting and the startle response to acoustic stress in humans, INT J NEUROSCI., 110(3-4):147-57 (2001), and Lam et al., The Can-SAD Study: a
randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of light therapy and fluoxetine in patients with winter seasonal affective disorder, AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY, 163(5):805-12 (2006), each incorporated by reference.  In some instances, color scheme
modifier module 3428 may include a computer processor.  Further, operation 4106 illustrates modifying at least a portion of text of an artificial sensory experience to alter at least one effect of the bioactive agent.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32
through 35, text modifier module 3430 may modify at least a portion of text of an artificial sensory experience to alter at least one effect of the bioactive agent.  In one instance, text modifier module 3430 may modify a portion of instructional text in
a virtual world including a computer game to alter an effect of a bioactive agent including a prescribed herbal memory supplement.  Text modification may improve memory by utilizing techniques such as underlining, highlighting, boldfacing, and/or
mnemonics as discussed in Carney, R. N., &amp; Levin, J. R., Mnemonic instruction with a focus on transfer, JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY, 92(4):783-90, incorporated herein by reference.  Another example may include instructional text providing
contextual or associative information, perhaps individualized, to aid in remembering during the rest of a module.  Another example of text modification and memory may include modifying the use of interactive components, e.g. via a keyboard and/or
speakers, to use multiple forms of memory input, including visual, auditory, motor, and contextual.  For example, this may be used to aid memory and/or in learning disorders such as dysgraphia, and/or memory disorders, such as in conjunction with
memory-enhancing medications, for example cholinesterase inhibitors or herbal memory supplements.  Additionally, text messages may be added and/or altered based on cognitive therapy but individualized for the person, affliction, and/or medication (e.g.
an antidepressant and instructions to work toward a goal within a game that will aid in refuting automatic negative thoughts).  In some instances, text modifier module 3430 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 42 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 3600 of FIG. 36.  FIG. 42 illustrates example embodiments where operation 3620 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include
operation 4202, operation 4204, operation 4206, and/or operation 4208.
<br/><br/> Operation 4202 illustrates altering a sound in an artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, sound alterer module 3432 may alter a sound in an artificial sensory experience.  In one instance, sound alterer
module 3432 may alter a sound in a virtual world, such as an instructor's voice tone in an instructional tutorial.  This may be done as a custom-tailored feature.  For example, various voice tones may be tested with an individual in order to find one
that has the most significant benefit for the individual, in conjunction with the bioactive agent.  In some instances, sound alterer module 3432 may include a computer processor.  Further, operation 4204 illustrates altering at least a portion of music
in the artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, music alterer module 3434 may alter at least a portion of music in the artificial sensory experience.  In one instance, music alterer module 3434 may alter a portion of
music including background music in an instructional tutorial.  Music in the artificial sensory experience may include pitch, rhythm, tempo, meter, and articulation, dynamics, lyrics, timbre and texture.  In one specific instance, music alterer module
3434 may alter a portion of uptempo music to soothing classical music in an artificial sensory experience coupled with administration of an anxiolytic.  Such a music alteration may serve to provide a calming and/or relaxing environment where the effects
of the anxiolytic may be facilitated.  In another instance, a sound pitch may be altered to affect bone (as in healing fractures and/or promoting bone growth) and/or sinuses (including joints).  Additionally, music alterer module 3434 may include
providing another type of sound, such as a low frequency, to aid in healing, e.g. in conjunction with pain medication and/or an anti-inflammatory medication.  In another example, the sound may originate from a natural source, for instance a purr of a
cat, possibly provided at a particular pitch, to aid in relaxation, as in conjunction with a tranquilizer, and/or in heating tissue in conjunction with pain medication or anti-inflammatories.  Further discussion regarding low frequency therapeutic
biomechanical stimulation may be found in von Muggenthaler, E. K., The Felid purr: low frequency therapeutic biomechanical stimulation, 12th International Conference on Low Frequency Noise and Vibration and its Control, Bristol, UK, Sep. 18-20, 2006,

patent application Ser.  No. 11/262,884, each incorporated herein by reference.  In some instances, music alterer module 3434 may include a computer processor.  Further, operation 4206 illustrates altering at least a portion of ambient noise in the
artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, ambient noise alterer module 3436 may alter at least a portion of ambient noise in the artificial sensory experience.  In one instance, ambient noise alterer module 3436 may
alter the ambient noise in an artificial sensory experience including a level of white noise in the online virtual world Second Life.  Ambient noise may include white noise, background noise, such as people talking or sounds naturally occurring in
nature, and/or room noise.  Changing the level of white noise may enhance the effect of an attention deficit drug such as Ritalin, or it may enhance the sedative properties of a sleep medication or tranquilizer.  Further discussion of the effects of
white noise may be found in Spencer, J. A. et al., White noise and sleep induction, ARCH DIS CHILD 65(1):135-7 (1990).  In some instances, ambient noise alterer module 3436 may include a computer processor.  Further, operation 4208 illustrates altering
at least a portion of voice in the artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, voice alterer module 3438 may alter at least a portion of voice in the artificial sensory experience.  In one instance, voice alterer module
3438 may alter a voice rhythm in an online tutorial.  Such alteration may enhance the effect of an attention deficit medication, for example by elimination or reduction of monotonic qualities in the voice rhythm of the online tutorial, for example.  Some
examples of a voice may include a voice recording, an artificially generated voice, and/or a human voice.  In some instances, voice alterer module 3438 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 43 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 3600 of FIG. 36.  FIG. 43 illustrates example embodiments where operation 3620 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include
operation 4302, operation 4304, operation 4306, and/or operation 4308.
<br/><br/> Operation 4302 illustrates modifying a bioactive agent dosage.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, dosage modifier module 3440 may modify a bioactive agent dosage.  In one embodiment, dosage modifier module 3440 may reduce an
antianxiety dose for an individual experiencing an artificial sensory experience and exhibiting a drastically reduced heart rate.  Such a dosage reduction may serve to achieve a bioactive agent effective dose, reduce one or more detected side effects,
and/or increase efficiency of the combination bioactive agent and artificial sensory experience.  One example of reducing a bioactive agent dosage using a controller in an implanted device may be found in Shelton, U.S.  Patent Publication No.

agent delivery modifier module 3444 may modify an antidepressant route of administration from an intravenous delivery to a tablet delivery.  Some examples of bioactive delivery methods may include mucosal administration, parenteral administration (such
as intravenous, intramuscular, and/or subcutaneous administration), topical administration such as epicutaneous administration, inhalational administration, transdermal administration, and/or enteral therapy, such as a pill taken orally, or the like.  In
some instances, bioactive agent delivery modifier module 3444 may include a computer processor and/or a medical device.
<br/><br/> Operation 4308 illustrates modifying an artificial sensory experience to enhance the efficacy of the bioactive agent.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, efficacy enhancing modifier module 3446 may modify an artificial sensory
experience to enhance the efficacy of the bioactive agent.  In one embodiment, efficacy enhancing modifier module 3446 may modify a virtual world by adding uptempo music to enhance the efficacy of an antidepressant.  Further discussion of music effects
may be found in Schellenberg, E. G. et al., Exposure to music and cognitive performance: tests of children and adults, PSYCHOLOGY OF MUSIC, Vol. 35, No. 1, 5-19 (2007), incorporated herein by reference.  In some instances, efficacy enhancing modifier

operation 4402, operation 4404, operation 4406, and/or operation 4408.
<br/><br/> Operation 4402 illustrates modifying an artificial sensory experience to reduce a side effect of the bioactive agent.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, side effect reduction modifier module 3448 may modify an artificial sensory
experience to reduce a side effect of the bioactive agent.  In one instance, side effect reduction modifier module 3448 may modify a virtual world by adding music and/or sounds occurring in nature for reducing a side effect including a headache due to an
administration of penicillin.  Further discussion of music effects upon a side effect may be found in Siedliecki, S. L. and Good, M., Effect of music on power, pain, depression and disability, JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING 54(5):553-562 (2006), and Natural
distractions reduce pain--study finds that sights and sounds of nature aid in pain reduction--Brief Article, MEN'S FITNESS.  October 2001, each incorporated by reference.  In some instances, side effect reduction modifier module 3448 may include a
computer processor.
<br/><br/> Operation 4404 illustrates adding at least one of visual or audio content to the artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, visual/audio content adder module 3450 may add visual and/or audio content to the
artificial sensory experience.  In one instance, visual/audio content adder module 3450 may add audio content including calming music to an artificial sensory experience including a virtual world for treating a phobia of heights.  Adding may include
increasing, creating, and/or combining content.  Some examples of visual content may include visual objects, light amount and/or intensity, and or color schemes.  Examples of audio content may include music, voices, artificial sounds, and/or white noise. In some instances, visual/audio content adder module 3450 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Operation 4406 illustrates deleting at least one of visual or audio content of the artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, deleter module 3452 may delete at least one of visual or audio content of the
artificial sensory experience.  In one instance, deleter module 3452 may delete visual content including a bright lighting environment in a virtual world for enhancing the effect of a medication for a migraine headache.  Deleting may include reducing
and/or eliminating visual and/or audio content.  In some instances, deleter module 3452 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Operation 4408 illustrates adding content to the artificial sensory experience and deleting different content of the artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, content adder module 3454 and deleter module 3452
may add content to the artificial sensory experience and deleting different content of the artificial sensory experience.  In one instance, content adder module 3454 may add classical background music to a virtual world and deleter module 3452 may delete
ambient street noise, for example, using sound detection and/or noise-cancellation technology, to enhance the effect of a sedative or other similar bioactive agent.  In some instances, content adder module 3454 and deleter module 3452 may include a
computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 45 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 3600 of FIG. 36.  FIG. 45 illustrates example embodiments where operation 3620 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include
operation 4502, and/or operation 4504.
<br/><br/> Operation 4502 illustrates modifying a sensate experience to alter the at least one effect of the bioactive agent.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, sensate experience modifier module 3456 may modify a sensate experience to alter
the at least one effect of the bioactive agent.  In one instance, sensate experience modifier module 3456 may modify a sensate experience including adding an aroma to enhance the effect of an anxiolytic drug or other similar bioactive agent.  A sensate
experience may include a thing perceived by the senses, such as an aroma, a sound, a feel, a taste, and/or a sight.  In some instances, sensate experience modifier module 3456 may include a computer processor.  Further, operation 4504 illustrates
modifying at least one of an olfactory stimulus, a haptic stimulus, a visual stimulus, an auditory stimulus, or a taste stimulus to alter the at least one effect of the bioactive agent.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, stimulus modifier
module 3458 may modify at least one of an olfactory stimulus, a haptic stimulus, a visual stimulus, an auditory stimulus, or a taste stimulus to alter the at least one effect of the bioactive agent.  In one instance, stimulus modifier module 3458 may
modify an olfactory stimulus by adding a floral aroma and/or gentle vibration to enhance a relaxing effect of a sedative or other similar bioactive agent, such as an antianxiety medication.  Further discussion of an olfactory stimulus may be found in
Shaw, D. et al., Anxiolytic effects of lavender oil inhalation on open-field behaviour in rats, PHYTOMEDICINE, 14(9):613-20 (2007), incorporated by reference.  In some instances, stimulus modifier module 3458 may include a computer processor.

<br/><br/> Operation 4602 illustrates modifying an artificial sensory experience implemented on a mobile device.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, modifier module 3418 may modify an artificial sensory experience implemented on a mobile device. In one instance, modifier module 3418 may modify a virtual world implemented in a web browser on a laptop computer having wireless capability and a battery by changing a background color theme to a brighter color theme in the virtual world.  An
artificial sensory experience modification, such as the color change in the above example, may enhance the effect of a bioactive agent.  For example, modifying the color in the above example while an anti-depressant is bioavailable may create a more
pleasant environment in the artificial sensory experience.  Some examples of a mobile device may include a laptop or notebook computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), an ipod, a smartphone, an Enterprise digital assistant (EDA), and/or a pager.  In
another example, modifier module 3418 may modify a city image by providing a soothing image having fewer people in the same part of the city and combining the modified image with an anti-anxiety medicine for alleviating a phobia, such as agoraphobia.  In
another example, modifier module 3418 may provide a stepwise procedure, with a gradually less specific procedure and/or less steps, for a compulsive patient to follow to achieve a goal for a particular outing while taking a selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor (SSRI).  In some instances, modifier module 3418 may include a computer processor.  Data sent to or from a mobile device may be encrypted by methods known in the art to preserve the integrity of the data and the privacy of the individual's
personal and medical information.
<br/><br/> Operation 4604 illustrates measuring at least one effect of a pain medication and modifying a virtual world experience to alter at least one effect of the pain medication.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, measurer module 3402 and
modifier module 3418 may measure an effect of a pain medication and modify a virtual world experience to alter at least one effect of the pain medication.  In one embodiment, measurer module 3402 may measure a reduction in pain resulting from an opioid,
such as hydrocodone, using a self assessment by the individual.  In the same embodiment, modifier module 3418 may alter a virtual world, such as a virtual environment used for creating distractions to reduce the perception of pain, by increasing the
distractions in the virtual world.  In another example, using a virtual world experience may include using and/or modifying a movie and/or presentation to relax the individual and place the individual into a state of hypnosis, further discussed in Carbis
et al., U.S.  Patent Publication No. 2006/0247489, which is incorporated herein by reference.  In some instances, measurer module 3402 and modifier module 3418 may include a computer processor and/or medical instrumentation.
<br/><br/> Operation 4606 illustrates measuring at least one effect of an anti-depressant medication prescribed for the individual and modifying at least one cheerful attribute in a virtual world experience.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35,
measurer module 3402 and modifier module 3418 may measure an effect of an anti-depressant medication prescribed for the individual, such as a better mood measured by increased activity while interacting in a virtual world including Second Life, and
modify a cheerful attribute, such as by adding a brighter color scheme for increasing the effect of the antidepressant medication.  In some instances, measurer module 3402 and modifier module 3418 may include a computer processor and/or medical
instrumentation.
<br/><br/> FIG. 47 illustrates an operational flow 4700 representing example operations related to measuring at least one effect of a combined bioactive agent and artificial sensory experience on an individual, modifying at least one of the bioactive agent
or the artificial sensory experience at least partially based on the at least one effect, and presenting an indication of a modified combined bioactive agent and artificial sensory experience at least partially based on a modified at least one bioactive
agent or artificial sensory experience.  FIG. 47 illustrates an example embodiment where the example operational flow 3600 of FIG. 36 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include operation 4710, operation 4712,
operation 4714, and/or operation 4716.
<br/><br/> After a start operation, operation 3610, and operation 3620, the operational flow 4700 moves to operation 4710.  Operation 4710 illustrates presenting an indication of a modified combined bioactive agent and artificial sensory experience at
least partially based on a modified at least one bioactive agent or artificial sensory experience.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, indication presenter module 3460 may present an indication of a modified combined bioactive agent and
artificial sensory experience at least partially based on a modified at least one bioactive agent or artificial sensory experience.  In one embodiment, indication presenter module 3460 may present an indication of a combined prescription antianxiety
medication and prescribed virtual world, in which the dosage of the antianxiety medication is a modification of a previously prescribed dosage.  In some instances, indication presenter module 3460 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> Operation 4712 illustrates presenting to at least one output device.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, output device presenter module 3462 may present to at least one output device.  In one example, output device presenter module
3462 may present an indication of a prescription medication and an artificial sensory experience to an output device 130, such as a printer 3302 at a health clinic.  An output device may include any hardware device configured for receiving computer
output.  Some examples of an output device may include a printer, a monitor, a mobile phone, a speaker, and/or a visual display unit.  The output device 130 may be used by individual 134.  In some instances, output device presenter module 3462 may
include a computer processor.  Further, operation 4714 illustrates presenting to at least one user interface.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, user interface presenter module 3464 may present to at least one user interface.  In one
embodiment, user interface presenter module 3464 may present to a touchscreen device.  A user interface may include means by which an individual may interact with a system.  Some examples of a user interface may include a touchscreen, a graphical user
interface, a tactile interface, and/or a live user interface.  In some instances, user interface presenter module 3464 may include a computer processor.  Further, operation 4716 illustrates presenting to at least one mobile device.  For example, as shown
in FIGS. 32 through 35, mobile device presenter module 3466 may present to at least one mobile device.  In one embodiment, mobile device presenter module 3466 may present to a mobile phone.  A mobile device may include a portable computing device and may
have wireless connection capability.  Some examples of a mobile device may include a laptop or notebook computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), an ipod, a smartphone, an Enterprise digital assistant (EDA), and/or a pager.  In some instances, mobile
device presenter module 3466 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 48 illustrates alternative embodiments of the example operational flow 4700 of FIG. 47.  FIG. 48 illustrates example embodiments where operation 4710 may include at least one additional operation.  Additional operations may include
operation 4802, operation 4804, and/or operation 4806.
<br/><br/> Operation 4802 illustrates presenting to a third party.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, third party presenter module 3468 may present to a third party.  For example, third party presenter module 3468 may present to an individual's
physician.  A third party may include a party that is an independent party, person, and/or entity.  Some examples of a third party may include a physician, a medical database, a hospital, a law enforcement agency, and/or a pharmacy.  One example of
reporting to a third party may include creating displays and reports for aggregating data from therapy results, further discussed in Bair et al., U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,067,523, which is incorporated herein by reference.  In some instances, third party
presenter module 3468 may include a computer processor and/or a communications device.  Further, operation 4804 illustrates presenting to a health care provider.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, health care provider presenter module 3470
may present to a health care provider.  A health care provider may include a pharmacy, a pharmaceutical company, a medical device company, a research institution, a computer software and/or computer hardware company, a website, a nurse and/or a
physician.  In some instances, health care provider presenter module 3470 may include a computer processor.  Further, operation 4806 illustrates selectively presenting only to the individual.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 32 through 35, selective
presenter module 3472 may selectively present only to the individual.  Selective presenting may include limiting and/or blocking access of measuring and/or modification results to a specific party.  For example, selective presenter module 3472 may
present only to individual 134 and may keep results of a certain modification confidential.  In one embodiment, an encryption key may be employed to protect selected information.  In an additional example, selective presenter module 3472 may report only
to a law enforcement agency and/or representative, such as a probation officer, and not to individual 134.  In some instances, selective presenter module 3472 may include a computer processor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 49 illustrates a partial view of an example computer program product 4900 that includes a computer program 4904 for executing a computer process on a computing device.  An embodiment of the example computer program product 4900 is provided
using a signal-bearing medium 4902, and may include one or more instructions for measuring at least one effect of a combined bioactive agent and artificial sensory experience on an individual and one or more instructions for modifying at least one of the
bioactive agent or the artificial sensory experience at least partially based on the at least one effect.  The one or more instructions may be, for example, computer executable and/or logic-implemented instructions.  In one implementation, the
signal-bearing medium 4902 may include a computer-readable medium 4906.  In one implementation, the signal bearing medium 4902 may include a recordable medium 4908.  In one implementation, the signal bearing medium 4902 may include a communications
medium 4910.
<br/><br/> FIG. 50 illustrates an example system 5000 in which embodiments may be implemented.  The system 5000 includes a computing system environment.  The system 5000 also illustrates the user 118 using a device 5004, which is optionally shown as being
in communication with a computing device 5002 by way of an optional coupling 5006.  The optional coupling 5006 may represent a local, wide-area, or peer-to-peer network, or may represent a bus that is internal to a computing device (e.g., in example
embodiments in which the computing device 5002 is contained in whole or in part within the device 5004).  A storage medium 5008 may be any computer storage media.
<br/><br/> The computing device 5002 includes computer-executable instructions 5010 that when executed on the computing device 5002 cause the computing device 5002 to measure at least one effect of a combined bioactive agent and artificial sensory
experience on an individual and modify at least one of the bioactive agent or the artificial sensory experience at least partially based on the at least one effect.  As referenced above and as shown in FIG. 50, in some examples, the computing device 5002
may optionally be contained in whole or in part within the device 5004.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 50, then, the system 5000 includes at least one computing device (e.g., 5002 and/or 5004).  The computer-executable instructions 5010 may be executed on one or more of the at least one computing device.  For example, the computing device
5002 may implement the computer-executable instructions 5010 and output a result to (and/or receive data from) the computing device 5004.  Since the computing device 5002 may be wholly or partially contained within the computing device 5004, the device
5004 also may be said to execute some or all of the computer-executable instructions 5010, in order to be caused to perform or implement, for example, various ones of the techniques described herein, or other techniques.
<br/><br/> The device 5004 may include, for example, a portable computing device, workstation, or desktop computing device.  In another example embodiment, the computing device 5002 is operable to communicate with the device 5004 associated with the user
118 to receive information about the input from the user 118 for performing data access and data processing and presenting an output of the user-health test function at least partly based on the user data.
<br/><br/> Although a user 118 is shown/described herein as a single illustrated figure, those skilled in the art wilt appreciate that a user 118 may be representative of a human user, a robotic user (e.g., computational entity), and/or substantially any
combination thereof (e.g., a user may be assisted by one or more robotic agents).  In addition, a user 118, as set forth herein, although shown as a single entity may in fact be composed of two or more entities.  Those skilled in the art will appreciate
that, in general, the same may be said of "sender" and/or other entity-oriented terms as such terms are used herein.
<br/><br/> Following are a series of flowcharts depicting implementations.  For ease of understanding, the flowcharts are organized such that the initial flowcharts present implementations via an example implementation and thereafter the following
flowcharts present alternate implementations and/or expansions of the initial flowchart(s) as either sub-component operations or additional component operations building on one or more earlier-presented flowcharts.  Those having skill in the art will
appreciate that the style of presentation utilized herein (e.g., beginning with a presentation of a flowchart(s) presenting an example implementation and thereafter providing additions to and/or further details in subsequent flowcharts) generally allows
for a rapid and easy understanding of the various process implementations.  In addition, those skilled in the art will further appreciate that the style of presentation used herein also lends itself well to modular and/or object-oriented program design
paradigms.
<br/><br/> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the foregoing specific exemplary processes and/or devices and/or technologies are representative of more general processes and/or devices and/or technologies taught elsewhere herein, such as in the
claims filed herewith and/or elsewhere in the present application.
<br/><br/> Those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between hardware, software, and/or firmware implementations of aspects of systems; the use of hardware,
software, and/or firmware is generally (but not always, in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant) a design choice representing cost vs.  efficiency tradeoffs.  Those having skill in the art will
appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and/or systems and/or other technologies described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and/or firmware), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the
processes and/or systems and/or other technologies are deployed.  For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and/or firmware vehicle; alternatively, if flexibility is
paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and/or firmware.  Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes
and/or devices and/or other technologies described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific
concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary.  Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will typically employ optically-oriented hardware, software, and or
firmware.
<br/><br/> In some implementations described herein, logic and similar implementations may include software or other control structures suitable to operation.  Electronic circuitry, for example, may manifest one or more paths of electrical current
constructed and arranged to implement various logic functions as described herein.  In some implementations, one or more media are configured to bear a device-detectable implementation if such media hold or transmit a special-purpose device instruction
set operable to perform as described herein.  In some variants, for example, this may manifest as an update or other modification of existing software or firmware, or of gate arrays or other programmable hardware, such as by performing a reception of or
a transmission of one or more instructions in relation to one or more operations described herein.  Alternatively or additionally, in some variants, an implementation may include special-purpose hardware, software, firmware components, and/or
general-purpose components executing or otherwise invoking special-purpose components.  Specifications or other implementations may be transmitted by one or more instances of tangible transmission media as described herein, optionally by packet
transmission or otherwise by passing through distributed media at various times.
<br/><br/> Alternatively or additionally, implementations may include executing a special-purpose instruction sequence or otherwise invoking circuitry for enabling, triggering, coordinating, requesting, or otherwise causing one or more occurrences of any
functional operations described above.  In some variants, operational or other logical descriptions herein may be expressed directly as source code and compiled or otherwise invoked as an executable instruction sequence.  In some contexts, for example,
C++ or other code sequences can be compiled directly or otherwise implemented in high-level descriptor languages (e.g., a logic-synthesizable language, a hardware description language, a hardware design simulation, and/or other such similar mode(s) of
expression).  Alternatively or additionally, some or all of the logical expression may be manifested as a Verilog-type hardware description or other circuitry model before physical implementation in hardware, especially for basic operations or
timing-critical applications.  Those skilled in the art will recognize how to obtain, configure, and optimize suitable transmission or computational elements, material supplies, actuators, or other common structures in light of these teachings.
<br/><br/> The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and/or processes via the use of block diagrams, flowcharts, and/or examples.  Insofar as such block diagrams, flowcharts, and/or examples contain one or more
functions and/or operations, it will be understood by those within the art that each function and/or operation within such block diagrams, flowcharts, or examples can be implemented, individually and/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware,
software, firmware, or virtually any combination thereof.  In one embodiment, several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), digital
signal processors (DSPs), or other integrated formats.  However, those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein, in whole or in part, can be equivalently implemented in integrated circuits, as one or more
computer programs running on one or more computers (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems), as one or more programs running on one or more processors (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors),
as firmware, or as virtually any combination thereof, and that designing the circuitry and/or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure.  In addition, those
skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies
regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution.  Examples of a signal bearing medium include, but are not limited to, the following: a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk, a hard disk
drive, a Compact Disc (CD), a Digital Video Disk (DVD), a digital tape, a computer memory, etc.; and a transmission type medium such as a digital and/or an analog communication medium (e.g., a fiber optic cable, a waveguide, a wired communications link,
a wireless communication link (e.g., transmitter, receiver, transmission logic, reception logic, etc.), etc.).
<br/><br/> In a general sense, those skilled in the art will recognize that the various embodiments described herein can be implemented, individually and/or collectively, by various types of electro-mechanical systems having a wide range of electrical
components such as hardware, software, firmware, and/or virtually any combination thereof; and a wide range of components that may impart mechanical force or motion such as rigid bodies, spring or torsional bodies, hydraulics, electro-magnetically
actuated devices, and/or virtually any combination thereof.  Consequently, as used herein "electro-mechanical system" includes, but is not limited to, electrical circuitry operably coupled with a transducer (e.g., an actuator, a motor, a piezoelectric
crystal, a Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS), etc.), electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific
integrated circuit, electrical circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices
described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices described herein), electrical circuitry forming a memory device (e.g., forms of memory (e.g., random access, flash, read
only, etc.)), electrical circuitry forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, optical-electrical equipment, etc.), and/or any non-electrical analog thereto, such as optical or other analogs.  Those skilled in the art will also
appreciate that examples of electro-mechanical systems include but are not limited to a variety of consumer electronics systems, medical devices, as well as other systems such as motorized transport systems, factory automation systems, security systems,
and/or communication/computing systems.  Those skilled in the art will recognize that electro-mechanical as used herein is not necessarily limited to a system that has both electrical and mechanical actuation except as context may dictate otherwise.
<br/><br/> In a general sense, those skilled in the art will recognize that the various aspects described herein which can be implemented, individually and/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, and/or any combination thereof can
be viewed as being composed of various types of "electrical circuitry." Consequently, as used herein "electrical circuitry" includes, but is not Limited to, electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having
at least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific integrated circuit, electrical circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer
configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices described herein),
electrical circuitry forming a memory device (e.g., forms of memory (e.g., random access, flash, read only, etc.)), and/or electrical circuitry forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, optical-electrical equipment, etc.). 
Those having skill in the art will recognize that the subject matter described herein may be implemented in an analog or digital fashion or some combination thereof.
<br/><br/> Those skilled in the art will recognize that at least a portion of the devices and/or processes described herein can be integrated into a data processing system.  Those having skill in the art will recognize that a data processing system
generally includes one or more of a system unit housing, a video display device, memory such as volatile or non-volatile memory, processors such as microprocessors or digital signal processors, computational entities such as operating systems, drivers,
graphical user interfaces, and applications programs, one or more interaction devices (e.g., a touch pad, a touch screen, an antenna, etc.), and/or control systems including feedback loops and control motors (e.g., feedback for sensing position and/or
velocity; control motors for moving and/or adjusting components and/or quantities).  A data processing system may be implemented utilizing suitable commercially available components, such as those typically found in data computing/communication and/or
network computing/communication systems.
<br/><br/> Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to implement devices and/or processes and/or systems, and thereafter use engineering and/or other practices to integrate such implemented devices and/or processes and/or
systems into more comprehensive devices and/or processes and/or systems.  That is, at least a portion of the devices and/or processes and/or systems described herein can be integrated into other devices and/or processes and/or systems via a reasonable
amount of experimentation.  Those having skill in the art will recognize that examples of such other devices and/or processes and/or systems might include--as appropriate to context and application--all or part of devices and/or processes and/or systems

<br/><br/> In certain cases, use of a system or method may occur in a territory even if components are located outside the territory.  For example, in a distributed computing context, use of a distributed computing system may occur in a territory even
though parts of the system may be located outside of the territory (e.g., relay, server, processor, signal-bearing medium, transmitting computer, receiving computer, etc. located outside the territory).
<br/><br/> A sale of a system or method may likewise occur in a territory even if components of the system or method are located and/or used outside the territory.
<br/><br/> Further, implementation of at least part of a system for performing a method in one territory does not preclude use of the system in another territory.
<br/><br/> All of the above U.S.  patents, U.S.  patent application publications, U.S.  patent applications, foreign patents, foreign patent applications and non-patent publications referred to in this specification and/or Listed in any Application Data
Sheet, are incorporated herein by reference, to the extent not inconsistent herewith.
<br/><br/> One skilled in the art will recognize that the herein described components (e.g., operations), devices, objects, and the discussion accompanying them are used as examples for the sake of conceptual clarity and that various configuration
modifications are contemplated.  Consequently, as used herein, the specific exemplars set forth and the accompanying discussion are intended to be representative of their more general classes.  In general, use of any specific exemplar is intended to be
representative of its class, and the non-inclusion of specific components (e.g., operations), devices, and objects should not be taken limiting.
<br/><br/> Although user 118 is shown/described herein as a single illustrated figure, those skilled in the art will appreciate that user 118 may be representative of a human user, a robotic user (e.g., computational entity), and/or substantially any
combination thereof (e.g., a user may be assisted by one or more robotic agents) unless context dictates otherwise.  Those skilled in the art will appreciate that, in general, the same may be said of "sender" and/or other entity-oriented terms as such
terms are used herein unless context dictates otherwise.
<br/><br/> With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or
application.  The various singular/plural permutations are not expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.
<br/><br/> The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components.  It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many
other architectures may be implemented which achieve the same functionality.  In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively "associated" such that the desired functionality is achieved.  Hence, any
two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as "associated with" each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components.  Likewise, any two components so
associated can also be viewed as being "operably connected", or "operably coupled," to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being "operably couplable," to each other
to achieve the desired functionality.  Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and/or physically interacting components, and/or wirelessly interactable, and/or wirelessly interacting components, and/or
logically interacting, and/or logically interactable components.
<br/><br/> In some instances, one or more components may be referred to herein as "configured to," "configurable to," "operable/operative to," "adapted/adaptable," "able to," "conformable/conformed to," etc. Those skilled in the art will recognize that
"configured to" can generally encompass active-state components and/or inactive-state components and/or standby-state components, unless context requires otherwise.
<br/><br/> While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing
from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. 
It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as "open" terms (e.g., the term "including" should be interpreted as
"including but not limited to," the term "having" should be interpreted as "having at least," the term "includes" should be interpreted as "includes but is not limited to," etc.).  It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific
number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present.  For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may
contain usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim recitations.  However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or
"an" limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to claims containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or
"an" (e.g., "a" and/or "an" should typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.  In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim
recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers, typically means
at least two recitations, or two or more recitations).  Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, and C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would
understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, and C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.).  In
those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, or C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B,
or C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.).  It will be further understood by those within the art that typically a
disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms unless
context dictates otherwise.  For example, the phrase "A or B" will be typically understood to include the possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B."
<br/><br/> With respect to the appended claims, those skilled in the art will appreciate that recited operations therein may generally be performed in any order.  Also, although various operational flows are presented in a sequence(s), it should be
understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently.  Examples of such alternate orderings may include overlapping, interleaved, interrupted, reordered, incremental,
preparatory, supplemental, simultaneous, reverse, or other variant orderings, unless context dictates otherwise.  Furthermore, terms like "responsive to," "related to," or other past-tense adjectives are generally not intended to exclude such variants,
