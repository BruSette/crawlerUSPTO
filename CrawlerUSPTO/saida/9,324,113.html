       <p> Systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media for presenting
     social network connections in association with a search engine results
     page (SERP) are provided. Upon receipt of a search query, it is
     determined if the query is a name query and if social networking data
     associated with the user is available. If it is determined that the query
     is a name query and that social networking data associated with the user
     is available, it is determined if there is a connection match to the
     query. If it is determined that one or more social network connections of
     the user match the name query, the matching social network connection is
     presented in association with the SERP. Additionally, the user may add a
     presented social network connection as a first degree connection and/or
     send a message to a presented connection from the context of the SERP.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The subject matter of the present invention is described with specificity herein to meet statutory requirements.  However, the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of this patent.  Rather, the inventors have contemplated that
the claimed subject matter might also be embodied in other ways, to include different steps or combinations of steps similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies.  Moreover, although the terms
"step" and/or "block" may be used herein to connote different elements of methods employed, the terms should not be interpreted as implying any particular order among or between various steps herein disclosed unless and except when the order of
individual steps is explicitly described.
<br/><br/> Various aspects of the technology described herein are generally directed to systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media for, among other things, presenting social network connections in association with a search engine results page
(SERP) and in addition to any Web results determined to match an input search query.  Upon receipt of a search query, it is determined if the query, or a portion thereof, is a name query.  It is also determined if social networking data associated with
the user is available.  If it is determined that at least a portion of the query is a name query and that social networking data associated with the user is available, the name query is compared to information about the user's social network connections
to determine if there is a connection that matches the name query.  If it is determined that one or more social network connections of the user matches the name query, information about the matching social network connection is presented in association
with the SERP in addition to any matching Web results determined in response to the received query.  Embodiments of the present invention further permit the user to add a presented social network connection as a first degree connection and/or send a
message to a presented social network connection from the context of the SERP.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention is directed to one or more computer-readable storage media storing computer-useable instructions that, when used by one or more computing devices, cause the one or more computing devices to
perform a method for enabling presentation of social network connections in association with SERPs.  The method includes receiving a search query from a user; determining that at least a portion of the received search query is a name query; determining
that data associated with one or more social network connections of the user is available; determining that the name query matches the data associated with the one or more social network connections of the user; and presenting information derived from
the data associated with the one or more social network connections of the user and pertaining to the one or more social network connections of the user that matches the name query in association with a SERP.
<br/><br/> Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to one or more computer-readable storage media storing computer-useable instructions that, when used by one or more computing devices, cause the one or more computing devices to perform a
method for adding a social network connection to a user's social network from a Web page outside of a domain associated with a social networking application (e.g., a SERP).  The method includes receiving a search query from a user, determining that at
least a portion of the received search query is a name query, determining that data associated with one or more social network connections of the user is available, determining that the name query matches the data associated with the one or more social
network connections of the user, and presenting information derived from the data associated with the one or more social network connections of the user and pertaining to the one or more social network connections of the user that matches the name query
in association with a SERP.  The method further includes presenting, in association with the SERP, a selectable option for the user to add at least one of the one or more social network connections of the user to the user's social network as a first
degree connection.
<br/><br/> In yet another embodiment, the present invention is directed to one or more computer-readable storage media storing computer-useable instructions that, when used by one or more computing devices, cause the one or more computing devices to
perform a method for sending electronic messages to social network connections of a user from a Web page outside of a domain associated with a social networking application (e.g., a SERP), the electronic message appearing to the receiving social network
connection as though it was sent from the social networking domain.  The method includes receiving a search query from a user, determining that at least a portion of the received search query is a name query, determining that data associated with one or
more social network connections of the user is available, determining that the name query matches the data associated with the one or more social network connections of the user, and presenting information derived from the data associated with the one or
more social network connections of the user and pertaining to the one or more social network connections of the user that matches the name query in association with a SERP.  The method further includes presenting, in association with the SERP, a
selectable option for the user to send an electronic message to at least one of the one or more social network connections of the user.
<br/><br/> Having briefly described an overview of embodiments of the present invention, an exemplary operating environment in which embodiments of the present invention may be implemented is described below in order to provide a general context for

input/output (I/O) ports 118, one or more I/O components 120, and an illustrative power supply 122.  The bus 110 represents what may be one or more busses (such as an address bus, data bus, or combination thereof).  Although the various blocks of FIG. 1
are shown with lines for the sake of clarity, in reality, these blocks represent logical, not necessarily actual, components.  For example, one may consider a presentation component such as a display device to be an I/O component.  Also, processors have
memory.  The inventors hereof recognize that such is the nature of the art, and reiterate that the diagram of FIG. 1 is merely illustrative of an exemplary computing device that can be used in connection with one or more embodiments of the present
invention.  Distinction is not made between such categories as "workstation," "server," "laptop," "hand-held device," etc., as all are contemplated within the scope of FIG. 1 and reference to "computing device."
<br/><br/> The computing device 100 typically includes a variety of computer-readable media.  Computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the computing device 100 and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable
and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.  Computer-readable media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM,
flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the
desired information and which can be accessed by the computing device 100.  Combinations of any of the above are also included within the scope of computer-readable media.
<br/><br/> The memory 112 includes computer-storage media in the form of volatile and/or nonvolatile memory.  The memory may be removable, non-removable, or a combination thereof.  Exemplary hardware devices include solid-state memory, hard drives,
optical-disc drives, and the like.  The computing device 100 includes one or more processors that read data from various entities such as the memory 112 or the I/O component(s) 120.  The presentation component(s) 116 present data indications to a user or

<br/><br/> The I/O port(s) 118 allow the computing device 100 to be logically coupled to other devices including the I/O component(s) 120, some of which may be built in. Illustrative I/) components include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish,
scanner, printer, wireless device, and the like.
<br/><br/> As previously mentioned, embodiments of the present invention are generally directed to systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media for, among other things, presenting social network connections in association with a SERP.  Upon
receipt of a search query, it is determined if the query, or a portion thereof, is a name query.  It is also determined if social networking data associated with the user is available.  If it is determined that at least a portion of the query is a name
query and that social networking data associated with the user is available, the name query is compared to information about the user's social network connections to determine if there is a connection that matches the name query.  If it is determined
that one or more social network connections of the user matches the name query, information about the matching social network connection is presented in association with the SERP, in addition to any matching Web results determined in response to the
received query.  Embodiments of the present invention further permit the user to add a presented social network connection as a first degree connection and/or send a message to a presented social network connection from the context of the SERP.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 2, a block diagram is provided illustrating an exemplary computing system 200 in which embodiments of the invention may be employed.  Generally, the computing system 200 illustrates an environment in which presentation of
social network connections in association with SERPs is enabled.  Embodiments of the present invention also provide systems and methods for permitting the user to add a first degree connection and/or send a message to a social network connection from the
context of the SERP.  In this way, users can search for and communicate with social network connections without directly accessing a social networking application.
<br/><br/> Among other components not shown, the computing system 200 generally includes a client device 210, a social networking application 212, and a search application 214, all in communication with one another via a network 216.  The network 216 may
include, without limitation, one or more local area networks (LANs) and/or wide area networks (WANs).  Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.  Accordingly, the network 216
is not further described herein.
<br/><br/> It should be understood that any number of client computing devices, social networking applications, and search applications may be employed in the computing system 200 within the scope of embodiments of the present invention.  Each may comprise
a single device/interface or multiple devices/interfaces cooperating in a distributed environment.  For instance, the search application 214 may comprise multiple devices and/or modules arranged in a distributed environment that collectively provide the
functionality of the search application 214 described herein.  Additionally, other components/modules not shown also may be included within the computing system 200.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, one or more of the illustrated components/modules may be implemented as stand-alone applications.  In other embodiments, one or more of the illustrated components/modules may be implemented via the client device 210, as an
Internet-based service, or as a module inside the social networking application 212 and/or the search application 214.  It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the components/modules illustrated in FIG. 2 are exemplary in nature
and in number and should not be construed as limiting.  Any number of components/modules may be employed to achieve the desired functionality within the scope of embodiments hereof.  Further, components/modules may be located on any number of social
networking applications, search applications, or client computing devices.  By way of example only, the search application 214 might be provided as a single server (as shown), a cluster of servers, or a computing device remote from one or more of the
remaining components.
<br/><br/> It should be understood that this and other arrangements described herein are set forth only as examples.  Other arrangements and elements (e.g., machines, interfaces, functions, orders, and groupings of functions, etc.) can be used in addition
to or instead of those shown, and some elements may be omitted altogether.  Further, many of the elements described herein are functional entities that may be implemented as discrete or distributed components or in conjunction with other components, and
in any suitable combination and location.  Various functions described herein as being performed by one or more entities may be carried out by hardware, firmware, and/or software.  For instance, various functions may be carried out by a processor
executing instructions stored in memory.
<br/><br/> The client computing device 210 may include any type of computing device, such as the computing device 100 described with reference to FIG. 1, for example.  Generally, the client computing device 210 includes a browser 218 and a display 220. 
The browser 218, among other things, is configured to render search engine home pages (or other online landing pages), and render SERPs in association with the display 220 of the client computing device 210.  The browser 218 is further configured to
receive user input of requests for various web pages (including search engine home pages), receive user inputted search queries (generally inputted via a user interface presented on the display 220 and permitting alpha-numeric and/or textual input into a
designated search box) and to receive content for presentation on the display 220, for instance, from the search application 214.  It should be noted that the functionality described herein as being performed by the browser 218 may be performed by any
other application capable of rendering Web content.  Any and all such variations, and any combination thereof, are contemplated to be within the scope of embodiments of the present invention.
<br/><br/> The social networking application 212 is configured to facilitate electronic social networking between its users.  In this regard, the social networking application is configured to receive input of identifying information about a user and
maintain such information, for instance, in a data store (not shown) associated with the social networking application 212.  Identifying information may include, but is not limited to, a user profile page (the name of which is generally the name of the
user to whom it pertains), one or more networks of the user, a location of the user, interests of the user, and the identity of other users with whom the user has established connections.  The identifying information about the user may be input directly
by the user (e.g., name, location, interests, etc.) or may be derived from information input or otherwise provided by the user.  For instance, if a user inputs that s/he attended College A or that s/he works at Company B, networks associated with College
A and/or Company B may be associated with the user.  Exemplary social networking applications are well known in the art, for instance, a commonly known social networking application is <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> INC.  of Palo Alto, Calif.
<br/><br/> The social networking application 212 further is configured to permit its users to establish social network connections with other application users.  In this way, a user may be connected to another user by a first degree connection (e.g., a
"friend") meaning that the two users are directly connected with one another.  Or, a user may not be directly connected with another user but have a second degree connection (e.g, a "friend of a friend") or more remote connection with that user through
his/her first degree connections.
<br/><br/> The search application 214 is configured to receive and respond to requests that it receives from components associated with client computing devices, for instance, the browser 218 associated with the client computing device 210.  Those skilled
in the art of the present invention will recognize that the present invention may be implemented with any number of searching utilities.  For example, an Internet search engine or a database search engine may utilize the present invention.  These search
engines are well known in the art, and commercially available engines share many similar processes not further described herein.
<br/><br/> As illustrated, the search application 214 includes a query receiving component 222, a name query classifier 224, a connection determining component 226, an Application Programming Interface (API) calling component 228, and a transmitting
component 230.  The illustrated search application 214 also has access to a data store 232.  The data store 232 is configured to store information pertaining to user social networking identifiers and connections of users.  In various embodiments, such
information may include, without limitation, names of its users' profile pages, an identity of networks of its users, a location of its users and information about its users' social network connections (first degree connections and those that are more
distant or remote).  In embodiments, the data store 232 is configured to be searchable for one or more of the items stored in association therewith.  It will be understood and appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the information stored
in association with the data store 232 may be configurable and may include any information relevant to social networking identifiers and social network connections of a plurality of users.  The content and volume of such information are not intended to
limit the scope of embodiments of the present invention in any way.  Further, though illustrated as a single, independent component, the data store 232 may, in fact, be a plurality of storage devices, for instance a database cluster, portions of which
may reside in association with the search application 214, the social networking application 212, the client computing device 210, another external computing device (not shown), and/or any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> The query receiving component 222 of the search application 214 is configured to receive requests for presentation of SERPs having results that satisfy an input search query (e.g., matches identified via keyword matching).  Typically, such a
request is received via a browser associated with a client computing device, for instance, the browser 218 associated with the client computing device 210.  In embodiments, received requests for presentation of SERPs having satisfying search results are
also requests for presentation of results that are additional or supplemental to the Web search results satisfying the search query (e.g., instant answers).
<br/><br/> Upon receiving a query input by a user, the name query classifier 224 is configured to determine whether or not the input query is a name query.  A "name query," as the term is utilized herein, is a query that in whole or in part includes a
name.  For instance, a query that is in whole a name query may be the query "Bob Smith." A query that is in part a name query may be the query "Bob Smith Seattle." Name query classifiers generally utilize a list of known names (exact and derivative
versions) and employ a machine learning algorithm that examines an input query and outputs information concerning any matches (exact or derivative, as desired).  Name query classifiers are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and, accordingly, are
not further described herein.
<br/><br/> Once a query (or a portion thereof) is identified as a name query, the connection determining component 226 is configured to determine whether social networking information about the user is available.  In embodiments, such determination is made
by determining whether or not the requesting user is engaged in an active session with the social networking application 212.  A user may be engaged in an active session with the social networking application 212 by having a browser window actively
logged into the social networking application 212.  A user may also be engaged in an active session with the social networking application 212 even without having an active window if s/he has opted in a previous active session with the social networking
application 212 to stay logged into the service even upon closure of the browser session.  In another embodiment, the user may login to the social networking application 212 from the search application 214 using a social networking identifier associated
with the user.  Any and all such variations, and any combination thereof, are contemplated to be within the scope of embodiments of the present invention.  However the user establishes an active session with the social networking application 212, being
engaged in such active session permits the search application 214 to access information about the user's social network connections.  The connection determining component 226 is further configured to receive the user's social networking identification
(ID) from the social networking application 212.
<br/><br/> By way of example only, the exemplary social networking application <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> INC.  of Palo Alto, Calif.  employs an "instant personalization" functionality that automatically (that is, without an opt-in authentication process) enables users of
<b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> INC.  to log onto third party websites (e.g., the search application 214) with their <b><i>FACEBOOK</i></b> identity and access their <b><i>FACEBOOK</i></b> identity information from the context of the third party website.
<br/><br/> The API calling component 228 is configured to determine whether any connections of the requesting user match the name query.  In embodiments, the API calling component 228 makes a call to an API associated with the social networking application
212, the call including at least the name query and the user's social networking identification.  In other embodiments, a call is made to an API associated with a data store (e.g., data store 232) maintained by the search application 214 that includes
the same information.  Any and all such variations, and any combination thereof, are contemplated to be within the scope of embodiments of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Upon receipt of the API call, the social networking application 212 (and/or the data store 232, as appropriate) determines whether any matches exist between the name query and the user's social network connections.  In embodiments, only first
degree connections are identified as matching.  In other embodiments, more remote connections may be identified as matching as well.  If any matches exist, information about the matching social network connections is returned to the API calling component
228 for transmission to the user (e.g., via the transmitting component 230 of the search application 214).  Such information may include, without limitation, a name of any matching connection's profile page, an identity of one or more networks of a
matching connection, a location associated with a matching connection and an image associated with a matching connection's profile.
<br/><br/> The transmitting component 230 is configured to transmit the matching connection information to the requesting user for presentation as a result or answer on a SERP (e.g., on the display 220 associated with the client computing device 210). 
Presentation of matching connections is discussed more fully below with reference to FIGS. 6, 7 and 8.
<br/><br/> "Instant answers" refers to small snippets of information related to the keywords in a received query that are determined to be the most likely answer to the input query.  Such results generally are determined independently of the
algorithmically-derived Web search results and are thus results that are additional or supplementary to the Web search results satisfying the search query.  In embodiments, such additional or supplemental results are presented in a specified area of the
SERP that is differentiated from the Web search results.  In other embodiments, such additional or supplemental results are integrated and presented in association with the algorithmically-derived search results.  Exemplary additional or supplemental
results (instant answers) may include weather answers, news answers, sports answers, and the like.  In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, information pertaining to social network connections of the user may be presented on the SERP as
supplemental or additional search results.
<br/><br/> With reference now to FIG. 3, a flow diagram is illustrated showing an exemplary method 300 for presenting social network connections in association with a SERP, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  As indicated at block
310, a search query is received, e.g., via a search query input field of a user interface associated with a search application (for instance, utilizing the query receiving component 222 of the search application 214 of FIG. 2).  As indicated at block
312, it is then determined if the received query, or a portion thereof, is a name query (e.g., utilizing name query classifier 224 of the search application 214 of FIG. 2).  If it is determined that the received query is not, in whole or in part, a name
query, the method terminates, as indicated at block 314.  If, however, it is determined that at least a portion of the received query is a name query, it is next determined if the requesting user is connected to a social networking application (e.g.,
utilizing connection determining component 226 of FIG. 2).  If it is determined that the user is not connected to a social networking application, and thus that data associated with social network connections of the user is not available, the method
terminates, as indicated at block 318.  If, however, it is determined at block 316 that the user is connected to a social networking application, and thus that data associated with social network connections of the user is available, the method continues
as shown in either of FIG. 4 or 5, each showing different embodiments of the present invention, as more fully described below.
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 4, a flow diagram is shown illustrating an exemplary method 400 for presenting social network connections in association with a SERP utilizing data directly retrieved from a social networking application (e.g., social
networking application 212 of FIG. 2), in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  Upon completion of the method 300 illustrated in FIG. 3 and discussed herein above, a user's social networking application identification (ID) is
retrieved, as indicated at block 410.  A call is then made to an Application Programming Interface (API) associated with the social networking application using the user's social networking application ID.  This is indicated at block 412.  Utilizing data
maintained by the social networking application, it is determined if any social network connections of the user match the name query, as indicated at block 414.  The number of degrees removed from the requesting user a satisfying social network
connection may be is variable as desired.  In embodiments, only first degree and second degree connections are identified.  If no social network connections of the user match the name query, the method terminates, as indicated at block 416.  If, however,
one or more social network connections of the user match the received name query, data associated with the one or more matching connections is presented on the SERP in response to the received search query as a search result and/or an answer to the
query.  This is indicated at block 418.
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 5, a flow diagram is shown illustrating an exemplary method 500 for presenting social network connections in association with a SERP utilizing data retrieved from a data store associated with a search application (e.g.,
the search application 214 of FIG. 2), in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  Upon completion of the method 300 illustrated in FIG. 3 and discussed herein above, a user's social networking application ID is retrieved, as indicated at
block 510.  A call is then made to an API associated with the search application using the user's social networking application ID.  This is indicated at block 512.  Utilizing data maintained by the search application (e.g., in association with the data
store 232 of FIG. 2), is determined if any social network connections of the user match the name query, as indicated at block 514.  If no social network connections of the user match the name query, the method terminates, as indicated at block 516.  If,
however, one or more social network connections of the user match the received name query, data associated with the one or more matching connections is presented on the SERP in response to the received search query as a search result and/or an answer to
the query.  This is indicated at block 518.
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 6, a schematic diagram is illustrated showing an exemplary screen display 600 of a presentation of a social network connection in association with a SERP and in response to a name query, in accordance with an embodiment of
the present invention.  In the illustrated example, the input search query was "Bob Smith." Two social network connections of the requesting user were identified.  The first 610 is a first degree connection of the user and has an associated social
networking profile with the name "Bob Smith." A network associated with the connection ("Microsoft") and a location associated with the connection ("Seattle, Wash.") are identified, as is the nature of the connection (i.e., "Your First Degree
Connection").  A thumbnail image associated with Bob Smith is also shown.  With respect to this first degree connection, the user is presented with an option to "Send a Message" to Bob Smith, as more fully described below with reference to FIG. 7.  It
should be noted that in accordance with embodiments hereof, social network connections may be presented as illustrated but without the "Send a Message" indicator or functionality.
<br/><br/> The second social network connection 612 presented is a second degree connection of the user (or more distant connection of the user) and has an associated social networking profile with the name "Robert Smith." A network associated with Robert
Smith ("Microsoft") and a location associated with Robert Smith ("Seattle, Wash.") are identified.  The nature of the connection is implicitly identified by the indication that the user and Robert Smith have "14 mutual connections." Note that there is no
indication that Robert Smith is a first degree connection of the user as was present with the connection Bob Smith 610.  Not also that in addition to the option to "Send a message" to Robert Smith, the user is presented with an option to add Robert Smith
as a first degree connection (i.e., "Add as a First Degree Connection").  The presented information makes it clear that Robert Smith is connected to the requesting user by a more remote or distant connection than a first degree connection.  The
functionality to "Add as a First Degree Connection" from the SERP is more fully described below with respect to FIG. 8.
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 7, a schematic diagram is shown of an exemplary screen display 700 illustrating presentation of a social network connection having functionality to send an electronic message to an entity associated with a social
networking application from the context of a Web page not associated with the social networking application domain (e.g., the SERP), in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  As illustrated, upon user selection of the "Send a Message"
indicator associated with the first degree connection "Bob Smith", a popup window 710 is presented in line with the SERP that has some of the information already populated (namely, the intended recipient of the message).  In this way, the user is
permitted, from the context of the SERP, to send a message that would appear to the receiving user as if sent directly from the social networking application.  In another embodiment (not shown), selection of the "Send a message" indicator would
automatically navigate the user away from the SERP and into the social networking application for sending a message to the connection that is the subject of the presented search result.  Note that the same functionality would apply upon selection of the
"Send a Message" indicator associated with the more remote connection "Robert Smith."
<br/><br/> Turning now to FIG. 8, a schematic diagram is shown of an exemplary screen display 800 illustrating presentation of a social network connection having functionality to add a connection to a user's social network from the context of a Web page
not associated with the social networking application domain (e.g., the SERP), in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  As illustrated, upon user selection of the "Add as a First Degree Connection" indicator associated with the second
degree (or more remote) connection "Robert Smith", a popup window 810 is presented in line with the SERP.  In this way, the user is permitted, from the context of the SERP, to add a first degree connection to the user's social network.  In another
embodiment (not shown), selection of the "Add as a First Degree Connection" indicator would automatically navigate the user away from the SERP and into the social networking application for adding the connection that is the subject of the presented
search result as a first degree connection in the user's social network.
