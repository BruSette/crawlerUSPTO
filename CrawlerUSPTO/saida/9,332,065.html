<br/><br/>FIELD OF INVENTION
<br/><br/> This invention relates to methods and apparatus for safely and unobtrusively identifying prior browsing patterns on a mobile device.  More particularly, the present invention relates to utilizing an identifiable version of a graphical user
interface and linking the identifiable graphical user interface to prior browsing.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Traditionally, tracing of visitor access to a website is accomplished via a browser creating small files of text descriptive of user browsing behavior and stored the file on a personal computer.  The small file, sometimes referred to as a
"cookie" or an "HTTP cookie", "web cookie", or "browser cookie".  A browser checks for the cookie and if a cookie associated with a particular website is found on the personal computer, the cookie is sent to a website when a user requests that a website
be accessed by the browser.
<br/><br/> Typically, a cookie reports to the website "state" information based upon previous browser activity.  State information may include almost any activity engaged by the user.  Common aspects of state activity include items placed in shopping cart,
or areas of previous interest.
<br/><br/> Tracking cookies create references of a user's browsing history and aid a website to present content pertinent to the user.  Cookies are also utilized to remember passwords for users and remember input a user has previously entered, such as a
credit card number or an address.
<br/><br/> When a user accesses a website with a cookie function the website may check for a cookie resident on the user's PC.  If not cookie is found the website sends a cookie to the user's PC and the browser stores the cookie with the browser files in
the PC.  Subsequently, when the PC is used to access the same website, the website will recognize the PC because of the stored cookie with the user's information.
<br/><br/> Mobile communication products, such as cellular telephone or a tablet may not receive and store racking cookies as readily as personal computers.  This has created a dilemma since websites often rely on tracking cookie technology to offer full
functionality on their website.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Accordingly, the present invention provides methods and apparatus to identify a mobile device and associated web browsing activity from the mobile device and therefore, overcomes the disadvantages of prior art as briefly described above.
<br/><br/> A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to
perform the actions.  One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The present invention relates generally to identifying a User with one or both of previous web content presented to the User and actions taken by the User while browsing a website, URL or other network accessible resource.  In general, the
present invention creates a customized GUI when a User accesses a website.  A network access device, such as a mobile phone or tablet or a personal computer used by the User to access the website will typically store a version of the website on the
network access device and when the User subsequently accesses the website, the website content provider will compare the version of the website stored on the network access device with a current version of the content on a website and only transmit those
portions that have changed since the version on the network access device was last stored.
<br/><br/> By creating a customized GUI specific to the User, the User stores a version of the website GUI specific to the User.  When the User subsequently accesses the website and presents a last of the website stored on the User Network Access Device
that is specific to the User, the website is able to ascertain content previously accessed by the User and actions previously taken by the User.  In essence, the stored version of the website GUI acts not only to limit an amount of data needed to be
download to view the website on a subsequent visit, but also to identify the User.
<br/><br/> Glossary
<br/><br/> As used herein the following terms will have the following associated meaning:
<br/><br/> Token (sometime referred to as a "Tag"): as used herein refers to an identifier included in content downloaded to a user's network access device.  Examples of a Token include, but are not limited to: a number, an alphanumeric value, a hash mark,
a symbol, a pattern embedded in a logo, a UUID, a bar code or other device for conveying data.  Logo: as used herein refers to an image that indicates an identification of a good, service or legal entity.  As used herein a logo image may further include
a unique identification device.  User: as used herein refers to an individual, company, or group that operate a network access device, such as a mobile cellular device or a personal computer, to access a resource on the Internet.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 1, a block diagram of some exemplary implementations of the present invention is illustrated.  A web content server 101 provides content that may be accessed via a uniform resource locator URL or other resource location
device, such as, for example an IP Address.  The web content server 101 provides digital data that is functional with a network access device, such as a smart phone, tablet or other cellular device, to generate a graphical user interface.  According to
the present invention, the web content server 101 provides a GUI with at least some portion of the GUI unique to a particular network access device 104.  The Web Content Server 101 may include software that may be executed to builds a URL with a token or
tag built into the URL.
<br/><br/> An Action Tracking Server 102 tracks actions taken by a user via the network access device 104 and stores a record of actions taken.  A User Profile Server 103 is functional to maintain records including information associated with a User.  The
User Profile Server 103 may store records of what website were accessed by the Network Access Device 104 associated with the use, and actions, such as those tracked by action Tracking Server 102.  The User Profile Server may also maintain records of
information indicating one or more of: a geolocation from which a User accesses a Web Content Server 101; a time of day that the User access the Web Content Server 101; a type of device used as a Network Access Device 104; an operating system used on the
Network Access Device 104; previous advertisements viewed; previous actions; previous pages visited; previous products for which information was queried; if and when an ad was closed; how far in a progression of ad steps a User progressed; what IP
addresses as associated with the network access device; locations of various IP addresses associated with a same network access device; and other information that may be used to help ascertain what a Use has done and may do in the future.
<br/><br/> In another aspect, although the present invention does not require the use of cookies, in some implementations, the present invention may track the content of cookies and store the content of cookies in a User Profile.  The User Profile may be
tracked to a Network Access device and to IP addresses.  In this manner, some of the benefit of a cookie may be maintained in a place other than the User's storage medium, wherein the User's storage medium may include as the User's hard drive and the
place other than the User's hard drive may include a User Profile Server 103.  According to the present invention, the User Profile Server 103 may be accessed by a Web Content Provider and the Web Content Server 101 in determining content to be provided
to a specific user.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, by storing the content of cookies in a User Profile 106 on a User Profile Server 103, a Web Content Server 101 may be able to benefit from the data included in the cookie, even if the cookie is subsequently destroyed or made
inaccessible on the User's network Access Device 104.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 2, an example of a GUI 201 presented on a mobile device 200 is illustrated.  In some examples, as shown in FIG. 2, the GUI 201 may comprise an image 202 and a separate identification code, such as a Token 203.  The Token
203 may be identifiable by a human or incorporated into code used to present the GUI to the User.  Alternatively, a web content provider may utilize their own mark as a base image for the Token 203 or other identification device.  As such, a mark
associated with a User may be altered in subtle ways that may embed the Token 203 into a comprehensive webpage GUI.
<br/><br/> A GUI 201 including content viewable on the website is presented and stored on the mobile device 200.  Included in the website content is the Token 203 or other unique identifier.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 3, an exemplary tablet 301 and GUI 302 specific to a User are illustrated.  As presented, a user profile may be accessed to determine what may interest the User based upon previous browsing habits and website content
accessed, as well as demographics and geopolitical data associated with an area from an IP address stored in a user profile.  The User profile may be used to one or both of: generate custom content 303 and send custom content 303 to the User based upon
information contained in the User Profile.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 4, some exemplary method steps that may be executed in some implementations of the present invention.  At 401, a server may receive a request for web page content.  The request may be received in various formats, such as,
for example a URL entered into a browser.
<br/><br/> At 402 the server may additionally receive content of a previously loaded web page from a network access device used to make the request for web page content.
<br/><br/> At 403 it is determined if the content from the previously loaded web page includes a Token or other identifier.  If the content does include a Token, then at 404 the server receives the Token information.
<br/><br/> At 405, the server will access a User Profile stored on a server accessible to the web page content server.  At 406 the webpage content server will generate content based upon one or both of the User Profile and the web page previously viewed. 
At 407, the generated web page content is transmitted to the User via the network access device operated by the User.
<br/><br/> At 408, if a Token is not received from the User via a previous version of the URL content stored on the network access device, the server may generate webpage content based upon a most recent version of the web page and include in the generated
content a new token.
<br/><br/> At 409 a new User Profile may be generated and the new token may be associated with the User and the new User Profile.  At 410, User information may be tracked.  The User information may include one more of user actions, an IP address associated
with the network access device used by the User, a geo location of the User, a time of day, a length of time online, a number of pages visited, an operating system used by the user, a length of time spent on various web pages, and any other information
useful to better understand the User.
<br/><br/> At 411 the User Profile may be updated with the tracked user information.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 5, method steps are illustrated that may be implemented in some embodiments of the present invention.  At 501 a server may receive a Token and an IP address associated with a User.  At 502 it may be determined if the Token
is associated with other IP addresses.  If the Token is associated with other IP Addresses, at 503 the user Profile may be updated to include each IP address associated with the Token.  At 504, the IP address may also be associated with an IP Address
owner and at 506 the User may be associated with other users accessing the same web site via the same IP address or accessing other web pages via a same IP Address.  At 507 User activity may be logged.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 6, an exemplary processing and interface system 600 is illustrated.  In some aspects, access devices, such as a network access device 605, a mobile network access device 615 or laptop computer network access device 610 may
be able to communicate with an external server 625 though a communications network 620.  The external server 625 may be in logical communication with a database 626, which may comprise data related to identification information and associated profile
information.  In some examples, the external server 625 may be in logical communication with an additional server 630, which may comprise supplemental processing capabilities.
<br/><br/> In some aspects, the external server 625 and access devices may be able to communicate with a cohost server 640 through a communications network 620.  The cohost server 640 may be in logical communication with an internal network 645 comprising
network access devices 641, 642, 643 and a local area network 644.  For example, the cohost server 640 may comprise a payment service, such as PayPal or a social network, such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or a dating website.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 7, an illustration is provided with a controller 700 that may be embodied in one or more of communications accessible devices and utilized to implement some embodiments of the present disclosure.  Communications accessible
