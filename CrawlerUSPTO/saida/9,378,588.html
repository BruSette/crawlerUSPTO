<br/><br/> The broadcast receiving module 111 receives a broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information from an external broadcast managing server via a broadcast channel.
<br/><br/> The broadcast channel may include a satellite channel and a terrestrial channel.
<br/><br/> The broadcast managing server generally refers to a server which generates and transmits a broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information or a server which is provided with a previously generated broadcast signal and/or broadcast
associated information and then transmits the provided signal or information to a terminal.  The broadcast signal may be implemented as a TV broadcast signal, a radio broadcast signal, and a data broadcast signal, among others.  If desired, the broadcast
signal may further include a broadcast signal combined with a TV or radio broadcast signal.
<br/><br/> The broadcast associated information includes information associated with a broadcast channel, a broadcast program, a broadcast service provider, etc. And, the broadcast associated information can be provided via a mobile communication network. 
In this case, the broadcast associated information can be received by the mobile communication module 112.
<br/><br/> The broadcast associated information can be implemented in various forms.  For instance, broadcast associated information may include an electronic program guide (EPG) of digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) and electronic service guide (ESG)
of digital video broadcast-handheld (DVB-H).
<br/><br/> The broadcast receiving module 111 may be configured to receive broadcast signals transmitted from various types of broadcast systems.  By nonlimiting example, such broadcasting systems include digital multimedia broadcasting-terrestrial
(DMB-T), digital multimedia broadcasting-satellite (DMB-S), digital video broadcast-handheld (DVB-H), the data broadcasting system known as media forward link only (MediaFLO.RTM.) and integrated services digital broadcast-terrestrial (ISDB-T). 
Optionally, the broadcast receiving module 111 can be configured suitable for other broadcasting systems as well as the above-explained digital broadcasting systems.
<br/><br/> The broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information received by the broadcast receiving module 111 may be stored in a suitable device, such as a memory 160.
<br/><br/> The mobile communication module 112 transmits/receives wireless signals to/from one or more network entities (e.g., base station, external terminal, server, etc.).  Such wireless signals may represent audio, video, and data according to
text/multimedia message transceivings, among others.
<br/><br/> The wireless internet module 113 supports Internet access for the mobile terminal 100.  This module may be internally or externally coupled to the mobile terminal 100.  In this case, the wireless Internet technology can include WLAN (Wireless
LAN) (Wi-Fi), Wibro (Wireless broadband), Wimax (World Interoperability for Microwave Access), HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), etc.
<br/><br/> The short-range communication module 114 facilitates relatively short-range communications.  Suitable technologies for implementing this module include radio frequency identification (RFID), infrared data association (IrDA), ultra-wideband
(UWB), as well at the networking technologies commonly referred to as BLUETOOTH and ZIGBEE, to name a few.
<br/><br/> The position-location module 115 identifies or otherwise obtains the location of the mobile terminal 100.  If desired, this module may be implemented with a global positioning system (GPS) module.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1, the audio/video (A/V) input unit 120 is configured to provide audio or video signal input to the mobile terminal 100.  As shown, the A/V input unit 120 includes a camera 121 and a microphone 122.  The camera 121 receives and
processes image frames of still pictures or video, which are obtained by an image sensor in a video call mode or a photographing mode.  And, the processed image frames can be displayed on the display unit 151.
<br/><br/> The image frames processed by the camera 121 can be stored in the memory 160 or can be externally transmitted via the wireless communication unit 110.  Optionally, at least two cameras 121 can be provided to the mobile terminal 100 according to
environment of usage.
<br/><br/> The microphone 122 receives an external audio signal while the portable device is in a particular mode, such as phone call mode, recording mode and voice recognition.  This audio signal is processed and converted into electric audio data.  The
processed audio data is transformed into a format transmittable to a mobile communication base station via the mobile communication module 112 in case of a call mode.  The microphone 122 typically includes assorted noise removing algorithms to remove
noise generated in the course of receiving the external audio signal.
<br/><br/> The user input unit 130 generates input data responsive to user manipulation of an associated input device or devices.  Examples of such devices include a keypad, a dome switch, a touchpad (e.g., static pressure/capacitance), a jog wheel, a jog
switch, etc.
<br/><br/> The sensing unit 140 provides sensing signals for controlling operations of the mobile terminal 100 using status measurements of various aspects of the mobile terminal.  For instance, the sensing unit 140 may detect an open/close status of the
mobile terminal 100, relative positioning of components (e.g., a display and keypad) of the mobile terminal 100, a change of position of the mobile terminal 100 or a component of the mobile terminal 100, a presence or absence of user contact with the
mobile terminal 100, orientation or acceleration/deceleration of the mobile terminal 100.  As an example, consider the mobile terminal 100 being configured as a slide-type mobile terminal.  In this configuration, the sensing unit 140 may sense whether a
sliding portion of the mobile terminal is open or closed.  Other examples include the sensing unit 140 sensing the presence or absence of power provided by the power supply 190, the presence or absence of a coupling or other connection between the
interface unit 170 and an external device.  And, the sensing unit 140 can include a proximity sensor 141.
<br/><br/> The output unit 150 generates outputs relevant to the senses of sight, hearing, touch and the like.  And, the output unit 150 includes the display unit 151, an audio output module 152, an alarm unit 153, a haptic module 154, a projector module
155 and the like.
<br/><br/> The display unit 151 is typically implemented to visually display (output) information associated with the mobile terminal 100.  For instance, if the mobile terminal is operating in a phone call mode, the display will generally provide a user
interface (UI) or graphical user interface (GUI) which includes information associated with placing, conducting, and terminating a phone call.  As another example, if the mobile terminal 100 is in a video call mode or a photographing mode, the display
unit 151 may additionally or alternatively display images which are associated with these modes, the UI or the GUI.
<br/><br/> The display module 151 may be implemented using known display technologies including, for example, a liquid crystal display (LCD), a thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD), an organic light-emitting diode display (OLED), a
flexible display and a three-dimensional display.  The mobile terminal 100 may include one or more of such displays.
<br/><br/> Some of the above displays can be implemented in a transparent or optical transmittive type, which can be named a transparent display.  As a representative example for the transparent display, there is TOLED (transparent OLED) or the like.  A
rear configuration of the display unit 151 can be implemented in the optical transmittive type as well.  In this configuration, a user is able to see an object in rear of a terminal body via the area occupied by the display unit 151 of the terminal body.
<br/><br/> At least two display units 151 can be provided to the mobile terminal 100 in accordance with the implemented configuration of the mobile terminal 100.  For instance, a plurality of display units can be arranged on a single face of the mobile
terminal 100 in a manner of being spaced apart from each other or being built in one body.  Alternatively, a plurality of display units can be arranged on different faces of the mobile terminal 100.
<br/><br/> In case that the display unit 151 and a sensor for detecting a touch action (hereinafter called `touch sensor`) configures a mutual layer structure (hereinafter called `touchscreen`), it is able to use the display unit 151 as an input device as
well as an output device.  In this case, the touch sensor can be configured as a touch film, a touch sheet, a touchpad or the like.
<br/><br/> The touch sensor can be configured to convert a pressure applied to a specific portion of the display unit 151 or a variation of a capacitance generated from a specific portion of the display unit 151 to an electric input signal.  Moreover, it
is able to configure the touch sensor to detect a pressure of a touch as well as a touched position or size.
<br/><br/> If a touch input is made to the touch sensor, signal(s) corresponding to the touch is transferred to a touch controller.  The touch controller processes the signal(s) and then transfers the processed signal(s) to the controller 180.  Therefore,
the controller 180 is able to know whether a prescribed portion of the display unit 151 is touched.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1, a proximity sensor (not shown in the drawing) can be provided to an internal area of the mobile terminal 100 enclosed by the touchscreen or around the touchscreen.  The proximity sensor is the sensor that detects a presence
or non-presence of an object approaching a prescribed detecting surface or an object existing around the proximity sensor using an electromagnetic field strength or infrared ray without mechanical contact.  Hence, the proximity sensor has durability
longer than that of a contact type sensor and also has utility wider than that of the contact type sensor.
<br/><br/> The proximity sensor can include one of a transmittive photoelectric sensor, a direct reflective photoelectric sensor, a mirror reflective photoelectric sensor, a radio frequency oscillation proximity sensor, an electrostatic capacity proximity
sensor, a magnetic proximity sensor, an infrared proximity sensor and the like.  In case that the touchscreen includes the electrostatic capacity proximity sensor, it is configured to detect the proximity of a pointer using a variation of electric field
according to the proximity of the pointer.  In this case, the touchscreen (touch sensor) can be classified as the proximity sensor.
<br/><br/> In the following description, for clarity, an action that a pointer approaches without contacting with the touchscreen to be recognized as located on the touchscreen is named `proximity touch`.  And, an action that a pointer actually touches the
touchscreen is named `contact touch`.  The meaning of the position on the touchscreen proximity-touched by the pointer means the position of the pointer which vertically opposes the touchscreen when the pointer performs the proximity touch.
<br/><br/> The proximity sensor detects a proximity touch and a proximity touch pattern (e.g., a proximity touch distance, a proximity touch duration, a proximity touch position, a proximity touch shift state, etc.).  And, information corresponding to the
detected proximity touch action and the detected proximity touch pattern can be outputted to the touchscreen.
<br/><br/> The audio output module 152 functions in various modes including a call-receiving mode, a call-placing mode, a recording mode, a voice recognition mode, a broadcast reception mode and the like to output audio data which is received from the
wireless communication unit 110 or is stored in the memory 160.  During operation, the audio output module 152 outputs audio relating to a particular function (e.g., call received, message received, etc.).  The audio output module 152 is often
implemented using one or more speakers, buzzers, other audio producing devices, and combinations thereof.
<br/><br/> The alarm unit 153 is output a signal for announcing the occurrence of a particular event associated with the mobile terminal 100.  Typical events include a call received event, a message received event and a touch input received event.  The
alarm unit 153 is able to output a signal for announcing the event occurrence by way of vibration as well as video or audio signal.  The video or audio signal can be outputted via the display unit 151 or the audio output unit 152.  Hence, the display
unit 151 or the audio output module 152 can be regarded as a part of the alarm unit 153.
<br/><br/> The haptic module 154 generates various tactile effects that can be sensed by a user.  Vibration is a representative one of the tactile effects generated by the haptic module 154.  Strength and pattern of the vibration generated by the haptic
module 154 are controllable.  For instance, different vibrations can be outputted in a manner of being synthesized together or can be outputted in sequence.
<br/><br/> The haptic module 154 is able to generate various tactile effects as well as the vibration.  For instance, the haptic module 154 generates the effect attributed to the arrangement of pins vertically moving against a contact skin surface, the
effect attributed to the injection/suction power of air though an injection/suction hole, the effect attributed to the skim over a skin surface, the effect attributed to the contact with electrode, the effect attributed to the electrostatic force, the
effect attributed to the representation of hold/cold sense using an endothermic or exothermic device and the like.
<br/><br/> The haptic module 154 can be implemented to enable a user to sense the tactile effect through a muscle sense of finger, arm or the like as well as to transfer the tactile effect through a direct contact.  Optionally, at least two haptic modules
154 can be provided to the mobile terminal 100 in accordance with the corresponding configuration type of the mobile terminal 100.
<br/><br/> The projector module 155 is the element for performing an image projector function using the mobile terminal 100.  And, the projector module 155 is able to display an image, which is identical to or partially different at least from the image
displayed on the display unit 151, on an external screen or wall according to a control signal of the controller 180.
<br/><br/> In particular, the projector module 155 can include a light source (not shown in the drawing) generating light (e.g., laser) for projecting an image externally, an image producing means (not shown in the drawing) for producing an image to output
externally using the light generated from the light source, and a lens (not shown in the drawing) for enlarging to output the image externally in a predetermined focus distance.  And, the projector module 155 can further include a device (not shown in
the drawing) for adjusting an image projected direction by mechanically moving the lens or the whole module.
<br/><br/> The projector module 155 can be classified into a CRT (cathode ray tube) module, an LCD (liquid crystal display) module, a DLP (digital light processing) module or the like according to a device type of a display means.  In particular, the DLP
module is operated by the mechanism of enabling the light generated from the light source to reflect on a DMD (digital micro-mirror device) chip and can be advantageous for the downsizing of the projector module 151.
<br/><br/> Preferably, the projector module 155 can be provided in a length direction of a lateral, front or backside direction of the mobile terminal 100.  And, it is understood that the projector module 155 can be provided to any portion of the mobile
terminal 100 according to the necessity thereof.
<br/><br/> The memory unit 160 is generally used to store various types of data to support the processing, control, and storage requirements of the mobile terminal 100.  Examples of such data include program instructions for applications operating on the
mobile terminal 100, contact data, phonebook data, messages, audio, still pictures, moving pictures, etc. And, a recent use history or a cumulative use frequency of each data (e.g., use frequency for each phonebook, each message or each multimedia) can
be stored in the memory unit 160.  Moreover, data for various patterns of vibration and/or sound outputted in case of a touch input to the touchscreen can be stored in the memory unit 160.
<br/><br/> The memory 160 may be implemented using any type or combination of suitable volatile and non-volatile memory or storage devices including hard disk, random access memory (RAM), static random access memory (SRAM), electrically erasable
programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), programmable read-only memory (PROM), read-only memory (ROM), magnetic memory, flash memory, magnetic or optical disk, multimedia card micro type memory, card-type
memory (e.g., SD memory, XD memory, etc.), or other similar memory or data storage device.  And, the mobile terminal 100 is able to operate in association with a web storage for performing a storage function of the memory 160 on Internet.
<br/><br/> The interface unit 170 is often implemented to couple the mobile terminal 100 with external devices.  The interface unit 170 receives data from the external devices or is supplied with the power and then transfers the data or power to the
respective elements of the mobile terminal 100 or enables data within the mobile terminal 100 to be transferred to the external devices.  The interface unit 170 may be configured using a wired/wireless headset port, an external charger port, a
wired/wireless data port, a memory card port, a port for coupling to a device having an identity module, audio input/output ports, video input/output ports, an earphone port and/or the like.
<br/><br/> The identity module is the chip for storing various kinds of information for authenticating a use authority of the mobile terminal 100 and can include User Identify Module (UIM), Subscriber Identify Module (SIM), Universal Subscriber Identity
Module (USIM) and/or the like.  A device having the identity module (hereinafter called `identity device`) can be manufactured as a smart card.  Therefore, the identity device is connectible to the mobile terminal 100 via the corresponding port.
<br/><br/> When the mobile terminal 110 is connected to an external cradle, the interface unit 170 becomes a passage for supplying the mobile terminal 100 with a power from the cradle or a passage for delivering various command signals inputted from the
cradle by a user to the mobile terminal 100.  Each of the various command signals inputted from the cradle or the power can operate as a signal enabling the mobile terminal 100 to recognize that it is correctly loaded in the cradle.
<br/><br/> The controller 180 typically controls the overall operations of the mobile terminal 100.  For example, the controller 180 performs the control and processing associated with voice calls, data communications, video calls, etc. The controller 180
may include a multimedia module 181 that provides multimedia playback.  The multimedia module 181 may be configured as part of the controller 180, or implemented as a separate component.
<br/><br/> Moreover, the controller 180 is able to perform a pattern recognizing process for recognizing a writing input and a picture drawing input carried out on the touchscreen as characters or images, respectively.
<br/><br/> The power supply unit 190 provides power required by the various components for the mobile terminal 100.  The power may be internal power, external power, or combinations thereof.
<br/><br/> Various embodiments described herein may be implemented in a computer-readable medium using, for example, computer software, hardware, or some combination thereof.  For a hardware implementation, the embodiments described herein may be

<br/><br/> FIG. 2A is a front perspective diagram of a mobile terminal according to one embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> The mobile terminal 100 shown in the drawing has a bar type terminal body.  Yet, the mobile terminal 100 may be implemented in a variety of different configurations.  Examples of such configurations include folder-type, slide-type,
rotational-type, swing-type and combinations thereof.  For clarity, further disclosure will primarily relate to a bar-type mobile terminal 100.  However such teachings apply equally to other types of mobile terminals.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 2A, the mobile terminal 100 includes a case (casing, housing, cover, etc.) configuring an exterior thereof.  In the present embodiment, the case can be divided into a front case 101 and a rear case 102.  Various
electric/electronic parts are loaded in a space provided between the front and rear cases 101 and 102.  Optionally, at least one middle case can be further provided between the front and rear cases 101 and 102 in addition.
<br/><br/> The cases 101 and 102 are formed by injection molding of synthetic resin or can be formed of metal substance such as stainless steel (STS), titanium (Ti) or the like for example.
<br/><br/> A display unit 151, an audio output unit 152, a camera 121, user input units 130/131 and 132, a microphone 122, an interface 180 and the like can be provided to the terminal body, and more particularly, to the front case 101.
<br/><br/> The display unit 151 occupies most of a main face of the front case 101.  The audio output unit 151 and the camera 121 are provided to an area adjacent to one of both end portions of the display unit 151, while the user input unit 131 and the
microphone 122 are provided to another area adjacent to the other end portion of the display unit 151.  The user input unit 132 and the interface 170 can be provided to lateral sides of the front and rear cases 101 and 102.
<br/><br/> The input unit 130 is manipulated to receive a command for controlling an operation of the terminal 100.  And, the input unit 130 is able to include a plurality of manipulating units 131 and 132.  The manipulating units 131 and 132 can be named
a manipulating portion and may adopt any mechanism of a tactile manner that enables a user to perform a manipulation action by experiencing a tactile feeling.
<br/><br/> Content inputted by the first or second manipulating unit 131 or 132 can be diversely set.  For instance, such a command as start, end, scroll and the like is inputted to the first manipulating unit 131.  And, a command for a volume adjustment
of sound outputted from the audio output unit 152, a command for a switching to a touch recognizing mode of the display unit 151 or the like can be inputted to the second manipulating unit 132.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2B is a perspective diagram of a backside of the terminal shown in FIG. 2A.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 2B, a camera 121' can be additionally provided to a backside of the terminal body, and more particularly, to the rear case 102.  The camera 121 has a photographing direction that is substantially opposite to that of the former
camera 121 shown in FIG. 21A and may have pixels differing from those of the firmer camera 121.
<br/><br/> Preferably, for instance, the former camera 121 has low pixels enough to capture and transmit a picture of user's face for a video call, while the latter camera 121' has high pixels for capturing a general subject for photography without
transmitting the captured subject.  And, each of the cameras 121 and 121' can be installed at the terminal body to be rotated or popped up.
<br/><br/> A flash 123 and a mirror 124 are additionally provided adjacent to the camera 121'.  The flash 123 projects light toward a subject in case of photographing the subject using the camera 121'.  In case that a user attempts to take a picture of the
user (self-photography) using the camera 121', the mirror 124 enables the user to view user's face reflected by the mirror 124.
<br/><br/> An additional audio output unit 152' can be provided to the backside of the terminal body.  The additional audio output unit 152' is able to implement a stereo function together with the former audio output unit 152 shown in FIG. 2A and may be
used for implementation of a speakerphone mode in talking over the terminal.
<br/><br/> A broadcast signal receiving antenna 124 can be additionally provided to the lateral side of the terminal body as well as an antenna for communication or the like.  The antenna 124 constructing a portion of the broadcast receiving module 111
shown in FIG. 1 can be retractably provided to the terminal body.
<br/><br/> A power supply unit 190 for supplying a power to the terminal 100 is provided to the terminal body.  And, the power supply unit 190 can be configured to be built within the terminal body.  Alternatively, the power supply unit 190 can be
configured to be detachably connected to the terminal body.
<br/><br/> A touchpad 135 for detecting a touch can be additionally provided to the rear case 102.  The touchpad 135 can be configured in a light transmittive type like the display unit 151.  In this case, if the display unit 151 is configured to output
visual information from its both faces, it is able to recognize the visual information via the touchpad 135 as well.  The information outputted from both of the faces can be entirely controlled by the touchpad 135.  Alternatively, a display is further
provided to the touchpad 135 so that a touchscreen can be provided to the rear case 102 as well.
<br/><br/> The touchpad 135 is activated by interconnecting with the display unit 151 of the front case 101.  The touchpad 135 can be provided in rear of the display unit 151 in parallel.  The touchpad 135 can have a size equal to or smaller than that of
the display unit 151.
<br/><br/> Interconnected operational mechanism between the display unit 151 and the touchpad 135 are explained with reference to FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B as follows.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B are front-view diagrams of a terminal according to one embodiment of the present invention for explaining an operational state thereof.
<br/><br/> First of all, various kinds of visual informations can be displayed on the display unit 151.  And, theses informations can be displayed in characters, numerals, symbols, graphics, icons and the like.
<br/><br/> In order to input the information, at least one of the characters, numerals, symbols, graphics and icons are represented as a single predetermined array to be implemented in a keypad formation.  And, this keypad formation can be so-called `soft
keys`.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3A shows that a touch applied to a soft key is inputted through a front face of a terminal body.
<br/><br/> The display unit 151 is operable through an entire area or by being divided into a plurality of regions.  In the latter case, a plurality of the regions can be configured interoperable.
<br/><br/> For instance, an output window 151a and an input window 151b are displayed on the display unit 151.  A soft key 151c' representing a digit for inputting a phone number or the like is outputted to the input window 151b.  If the soft key 151c' is
touched, a digit corresponding to the touched soft key is outputted to the output window 151a.  If the first manipulating unit 131 is manipulated, a call connection for the phone number displayed on the output window 151a is attempted.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3B shows that a touch applied to a soft key is inputted through a rear face of a terminal body.  If FIG. 3A shows a case that the terminal body is vertically arranged (portrait), FIG. 3B shows a case that the terminal body is horizontally
arranged (landscape).  And, the display unit 151 can be configured to change an output picture according to the arranged direction of the terminal body.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3B shows that a text input mode is activated in the terminal.
<br/><br/> An output window 151a' and an input window 151b' are displayed on the display unit 151.  A plurality of soft keys 151c' representing at least one of characters, symbols and digits can be arranged in the input window 151b'.  The soft keys 151c'
can be arranged in the QWERTY key formation.
<br/><br/> If the soft keys 151c' are touched through the touchpad (cf.  `135` in FIG. 2B), the characters, symbols and digits corresponding to the touched soft keys are outputted to the output window 151a'.  Thus, the touch input via the touchpad 135 is
advantageous in that the soft keys 151c' can be prevented from being blocked by a finger in case of touch, which is compared to the touch input via the display unit 151.  In case that the display unit 151 and the touchpad 135 are configured transparent,
it is able to visually check fingers located at the backside of the terminal body.  Hence, more correct touch inputs are possible.
<br/><br/> Besides, the display unit 151 or the touchpad 135 can be configured to receive a touch input by scroll.  A user scrolls the display unit 151 or the touchpad 135 to shift a cursor or pointer located at an entity (e.g., icon or the like) displayed
on the display unit 151.  Furthermore, in case that a finger is shifted on the display unit 151 or the touchpad 135, a path of the shifted finger can be visually displayed on the display unit 151.  This may be useful in editing an image displayed on the
display unit 151.
<br/><br/> To cope with a case that both of the display unit (touchscreen) 151 and the touchpad 135 are touched together within a predetermined time range, one function of the terminal can be executed.  The above case of the simultaneous touch may
correspond to a case that the terminal body is held by a user using a thumb and a first finger (clamping).  The above function can include activation or deactivation for the display unit 151 or the touchpad 135.
<br/><br/> A mobile terminal mentioned in this disclosure can include at least one of the components shown in FIG. 1 and can include a touchscreen.
<br/><br/> In the following description, an application controlling method in a mobile terminal according to a first embodiment of the present invention is explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a first flowchart of a method of controlling applications in a mobile terminal according to one embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 4, the mobile terminal 100 executes a plurality of applications under the control of the controller 180 [S410].
<br/><br/> In the case, each of the applications can include a function or menu that can be implemented using the mobile terminal 100.  For instance, the applications can include a message writing, a broadcast viewing, a camera photographing, an MP3
playback, a game, a photo album and the like.
<br/><br/> Moreover, if a multitasking function is supported, the mobile terminal 100 is able to simultaneously execute a plurality of the applications.
<br/><br/> For instance, in case of implementing the multitasking function, the mobile terminal 100 is able to take a picture using the camera [a second application_camera photographing] while playing back an MP3 file [a first application_MP3 playback]. 
In case of implementing the multitasking function, the mobile terminal 100 is able to write a message to send to a correspond party [a second application_message writing] while providing a broadcast program to be viewed by a user [a first
application_broadcast viewing].
<br/><br/> Under the control of the controller 180, the mobile terminal 100 displays an execution picture (hereinafter named a first execution picture) of a first one of a plurality of the application executed in the executing step S410 via the display
unit 151 [S420].
<br/><br/> In doing so, the first execution picture can be displayed on a whole display region of the display unit 151.  In case of executing the first application as a foreground, the mobile terminal 100 is able to display the first execution picture on
the whole display region.
<br/><br/> In the course of executing the displaying step $20, the mobile terminal 100 is able to display a 3D polyhedron (hereinafter named a multi-polyhedron), which displays each control window of at least one of a plurality the applications ongoing to
be executed in the executing step S410 except the first application on its corresponding facet, via the display unit under the control of the controller 180 [S430].
<br/><br/> In doing so, the at least one of a plurality of the applications except the first application can be executed as a background.
<br/><br/> Moreover, as the displaying steps S420 and S430 are simultaneously executed, the controller 180 is able to control the display unit 151 to display the multi-polyhedron on one picture while displaying the first execution picture thereon.
<br/><br/> In the following description, the displaying steps S420 and S430 are explained in detail with reference to FIGS. 5A to 5D.  For clarity and convenience of the following description, a plurality of the currently multitasking executed applications
can include a message writing in progress as a foreground, an MP3 playback in progress as a background, an internet access, a photo album and a broadcast viewing.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 5A, the mobile terminal 100 is able to display execution indicators 501 to 504 of an MP3 playback, an internet access, a photo album and a broadcast viewing, which are being executed as backgrounds, on a prescribed region of a
screen while displaying a message writing window as an execution picture of a message writing in progress of execution as a foreground.  Therefore, a user checks the execution indicators 501 to 504 to be aware which application is being executed as a
background.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 5A, the mobile terminal 100 is able to display a multi-polyhedron region 505 for receiving a command of a multi-polyhedron display from a user on a prescribed region of the screen.
<br/><br/> If the multi-polyhedron region 505 is activated by a user selection or a user touch in FIG. 5A, the mobile terminal 100 is able to display a multi-polyhedron 510 having facets.  In this case, control windows of the MP3 playback, the internet
access, the photo album and the broadcast viewing, which are being executed as backgrounds, are displayed on the facets of the multi-polyhedron 510, respectively [FIG.  5B].
<br/><br/> For instance, the multi-polyhedron 510 can display the MP3 play control window 511, the internet access control window 512 and the photo album control window 513 on the first to third facets, respectively.  And, the broadcast viewing control
window (not shown in the drawing) is displayed on a random facet failing to be seen in front view of the picture.
<br/><br/> For instance, file information (e.g., singer, song title, composer, writer, album information, etc.) of a currently played audio file and play control key regions (e.g., key regions of volume control, stop, fast forward, rewind, next title, list
view, etc.) and the like can be displayed in the MP3 play control window 511.  A representative webpage of a currently accessed website, a last accessed webpage and the like can be displayed in the internet access control window 512.  And, at least one
photo attached to or stored in a photo album can be displayed as a list or thumbnail in the photo album control window 513.
<br/><br/> Of course, if a multi-polyhedron display stop command is inputted by a user or a previously specified display time expires, the mobile terminal 100 is able to stop displaying the multi-polyhedron.
<br/><br/> While an execution picture of the message writing is displayed, even if a command for displaying a multi-polyhedron is not inputted by a user, the mobile terminal 100 is able to automatically display the multi-polyhedron.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 5C, while an MP3 playback, an internet access, a photo album and a broadcast viewing are being executed, if a background picture is displayed instead of an execution picture of a specific application, the mobile terminal 100 is
able to display execution indicators 501 to 504 and a multi-polyhedron 505 on a prescribed region of the background image.
<br/><br/> If the multi-polyhedron 505 is activated by a user selection or touch in FIG. 5C, the mobile terminal 10 is able to display a multi-polyhedron 510 having control windows of an MP3 playback, an internet access and a photo album displayed on its
facets, respectively while displaying a broadcast output picture as an execution picture of a broadcast viewing [FIG.  5D].
<br/><br/> In this case, while the background is being displayed, if the multi-polyhedron region 505 is activated, the application, of which execution picture is displayed, can include a randomly selected one of the currently executed application, an
application having an execution picture displayed most recently or an application selected by a user.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 4, in case of receiving an input of a control signal using the first control window displayed on the first facet of the multi-polyhedron displayed in the displaying step S430, the mobile terminal 100 controls an execution
of the application corresponding to the first control window [S440].
<br/><br/> Regarding the controlling step S440, the following description is made in detail with reference to FIGS. 6A to 8C.  For clarity and convenience of the following description, assume that the application execution is controlled using the

executed as the background and the foreground, respectively.
<br/><br/> In more particular, in case of receiving an input of a touch &amp; drag action between a first execution picture and a specific facet of the multi-polyhedron, the mobile terminal 100 displays a control window of the first application on a specific
facet and is able to display an execution picture of the specific application corresponding to the control window displayed on the specific facet, under the control of the controller 180.
<br/><br/> In this case, the touch &amp; drag action between the first execution picture and the specific facet is an example of an application switching command action and can include any action for commanding an application switching regardless of a type of
the corresponding action.
<br/><br/> Regarding this, the following description is made in detail with reference to FIG. 9A and FIG. 9B.  For clarity and convenience of the following description, assume that an application switching action is performed in the state shown in FIG. 5B.
<br/><br/> First of all, in case of receiving an input of a touch &amp; drag action to a third facet from a message writing window (example of an execution picture of a message writing) [FIG.  9A], the mobile terminal is able to display a control window 515 of
the message writing on the third facet while displaying an execution picture of a photo album corresponding to a photo album control window 513 displayed on the third facet [FIG.  9B].
<br/><br/> According to a first embodiment of the present invention, in case of receiving an input of a selection signal for a specific facet of a multi-polyhedron, the mobile terminal 100 is able to display an execution picture of a specific application
corresponding to a control window displayed on the specific facet.  In particular, the mobile terminal 100 is able to switch an execution type of the specific application from a background to a foreground.
<br/><br/> In this case, the selection signal for the specific facet includes a foreground execution command signal for the specific application and can include any action for commanding a foreground execution for the specific application regardless of a
type of the corresponding input action.
<br/><br/> Regarding this, the following description is made in detail with reference to FIGS. 10A to 10C.  For clarity and convenience of the following description, assume that an application switching action is performed in the state shown in FIG. 5B.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 10A, in case of receiving an input of a multi-touch action (example of an action for commanding a foreground execution of a photo album) to a third facet on which a photo album control window 513 is displayed [a], the mobile
terminal 100 enables a user to select an execution state of a message writing of which execution picture is currently displayed [b].
<br/><br/> For instance, the selectable execution states can include `terminate`, `control window display` and `partition screen`.
<br/><br/> If the `terminate` is selected as the execution state of the message writing in FIG. 10A (b), the mobile terminal 100 terminates the execution of the message writing and is then able to display an execution picture of a photo album [FIG.  10B].
<br/><br/> If the `partition screen` is selected as the execution state of the message writing in FIG. 10A (b), the terminal 100 partitions the screen into a plurality of partitioned screens and is then able to display the execution picture of the message

<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 38C, in case that a user inputs a touch &amp; drag action to a second point (located outside a 3D polyhedron 510) from a first point (located within the 3D polyhedron 510), the mobile terminal 100 is able to reduce the 3D
polyhedron 510 to correspond to a distance of the touch &amp; drag.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 38D, if a user inputs a touch action at a predetermined speed in a predetermined distance, the mobile terminal 100 is able to rotate a 3D polyhedron in a predetermined direction at a count or angle corresponding to the
predetermined speed.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 38E, the mobile terminal 100 partitions a screen into a plurality of regions.  The mobile terminal 100 displays an execution picture of an application on a first partitioned region and also displays a 3D polyhedron on a second
partitioned region.  Of course, as mentioned in the foregoing description, the mobile terminal 100 is able to display the 3D polyhedron 510 on a prescribed region of the execution picture.
<br/><br/> Regarding the 3D polyhedron display, if the mobile terminal 100 receives an input of a display command signal of a 3D polyhedron from a user or is in a situation for displaying the 3D polyhedron, it is able to automatically display the 3D
polyhedron.
<br/><br/> After a 3D polyhedron has been displayed, if an operation using the 3D polyhedron is not performed for a predetermined period of time, the mobile terminal 100 is able to stop displaying the 3D polyhedron under the control of the controller 180.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, the present invention provides the following effects and/or advantages.
<br/><br/> First of all, the present invention displays a 3D polyhedron including facets, on which control windows of all applications ongoing to be executed as backgrounds in multitasking mode are displayed, respectively, thereby effectively controlling
an operation of the corresponding application without a picture switching using the control window displayed on each of the facets of the 3D polyhedron.
<br/><br/> Secondly, the present invention displays a 3D polyhedron including facets, on which at least one or more data related to a currently executed application are displayed in a specific application executed state, thereby effectively controlling an
operation of the corresponding application without a picture switching using the data displayed on each of the facets of the 3D polyhedron.
<br/><br/> Thirdly, when a 3D polyhedron having a reception target item displayed on its facet is displayed in a data list display state, if a touch &amp; drag action to a specific facet of the 3D polyhedron from specific data in the data list is inputted, the
present invention enables the specific data to be effectively attached as a specific reception target item.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment of the present invention, the above-described application controlling methods can be implemented in a program recorded medium as computer-readable codes.  The computer-readable media include all kinds of recording
devices in which data readable by a computer system are stored.  The computer-readable media include ROM, RAM, CD-ROM, magnetic tapes, floppy discs, optical data storage devices, and the like for example and also include carrier-wave type implementations
(e.g., transmission via Internet).
<br/><br/> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions.  Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers
the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
