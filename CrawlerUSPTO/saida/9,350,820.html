<br/><br/> This disclosure generally relates to mobile devices.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A content-distribution network (CDN) may be a system of computers (e.g. edge servers) that cache or store copies of data at various locations.  By placing copies of data at locations near end users, a CDN may improve access to the data by
increasing access bandwidth and redundancy while reducing access latency.  Data cached in a CDN may include, for example, text, graphics, media files (e.g. audio, photo, or video), scripts, Uniform Resources Locators (URLs), and database queries.
<br/><br/> A social-networking system, such as a social-networking website, may enable its users to interact with it and with each other through it.  The social-networking system may create and store a record (such as a user profile) associated with the
user.  The user profile may include demographic information on the user, communication-channel information for the user, and personal interests of the user.  The social-networking system may also create and store a record of the user's relationships with
other users in the social-networking system (e.g. a social graph), as well as provide social-networking services (e.g. wall-posts, photo-sharing, or instant-messaging) to facilitate social interaction between or among users in the social-networking
system. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example network environment of a social networking system.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an example method of adjusting images for delivery to a mobile device.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 3A-3I illustrate adjusting an image for delivery to a mobile device.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates an example computer system.
<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> A social networking system may store records of users and relationships between users in a social graph comprising a plurality of user nodes, a plurality of concept nodes, and a plurality of edges connecting the nodes.  A user node of the social
graph may correspond to a user of the social networking system.  A user may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities).  A user node corresponding to
a user may comprise information provided by the user and information gathered by various system, including the social networking system.  For example, the user may provide his name, profile picture, contact information, birth date, gender, marital
status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, and other demographical information to be included in the user node.  Each user node of the social graph may correspond to a web page (typically known as a profile page). 
For example, in response to a request including a user name, the social networking system can access a user node corresponding to the user name, and construct a profile page including the name, a profile picture, and other information associated with the
user.  A concept node may correspond to a concept of the social networking system.  For example, a concept can represent a real-world entity, such as a movie, a song, a sports team, a celebrity, a restaurant, or a place or a location.  An administrative
user of a concept node corresponding to a concept may create the concept node by providing information of the concept (e.g., by filling out an online form), causing the social networking system to create a concept node comprising information associate
with the concept.  Each concept node of the social graph may correspond to a web page.  For example, in response to a request including a name, the social networking system can access a concept node corresponding to the name, and construct a web page
including the name and other information associated with the concept.  An edge between a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes.  For example, an edge between two user nodes can represent a friendship between two users.  For
example, the social networking system may construct a web page (or a structured document) of a concept node (e.g., a restaurant, a celebrity), incorporating one or more selectable buttons (e.g., "like", "check in") in the web page.  A user can access the
page using a web browser hosted by the user's client device and select a selectable button, causing the client device to transmit to the social networking system a request to create an edge between a user node of the user and a concept node of the
concept, indicating a relationship between the user and the concept (e.g., the user checks in a restaurant, or the user likes a celebrity).  In addition, the degree of separation between any tow nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to
traverse the social graph from one node to the other.  A degree of separation between two nodes can be considered a measure of relatedness between the users or the concepts represented by the two nodes in the social graph.
<br/><br/> A social networking system may support a variety of applications, such as photo sharing, on-line calendars and events, and instant messaging.  For example, the social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities.  For example,
the social networking system may allow users to post photographs and other multimedia files to a user's profile page (typically known as wall posts) or in a photo album, both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system. 
Social networking system may also allow users to configure events.  For example, a first user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event, location of the event and other users invited to the event.  The invited users may
receive invitations to the event and respond (such as by accepting the invitation or declining it).  Furthermore, social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar.  Similarly to events, the calendar entries may include times,
dates, locations and identities of other users.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example network environment of a social networking system.  In particular embodiments, a social networking system may comprise one or more data stores 101.  For example, the social networking system may store user profile
data and social graph information in data stores 101.  For example, each data store 101 may comprise one or more storage devices.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may comprise one or more computing devices (e.g., servers) hosting
functionality directed to operation of the social networking system.  In particular embodiments, one or more of data stores 101 may be operably connected to the social networking system's front end 120.  A user of the social networking system may access
the social networking system using a client device such as mobile device 122.  In particular embodiments, front end 120 may interact with mobile device 122 through network cloud 121.  For example, front end 120 may be implemented in software programs
hosted by one or more computing devices of the social networking system.  Front end 120 may include web or HTTP server functionality, as well as other functionality, to allow users to access the social networking system.
<br/><br/> Mobile device 122 is generally a portable computer or computing device including functionality for communicating (e.g., remotely) over a network.  For example, mobile device 122 can be a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a
handheld game console, an electronic book reader, or any other suitable portable devices.  Mobile device 122 may execute one or more client applications, such as a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari,
Google Chrome, and Opera, etc.) or special-purpose client application (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> for iPhone, etc.), to access or view content over a computer network.
<br/><br/> Network cloud 121 may represent a network or collection of networks (such as the Internet, a corporate intranet, a virtual private network, a local area network, a wireless local area network, a cellular network, a wide area network, a
metropolitan area network, or a combination of two or more such networks) over which mobile devices 122 may access the social network system.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store in data stores 101 data associated with applications and services provided by the social networking system.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store user
event data in data stores 101.  For example, a user may register a new event by accessing a client application to define an event name, a time and a location, and cause the newly created event to be stored (e.g., as a concept node) in data stores 101. 
For example, a user may register with an existing event by accessing a client application to confirming attending the event, and cause the confirmation to be stored in data stores 101.  For example, the social networking system may store the confirmation
by creating an edge in a social graph between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the event, and store the edge in data stores 101.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store location data in data stores 101.  For example, a node of a social graph stored in data stores 101 may comprise location data associated with a user or a concept.  For example,
location data associated with a concept (e.g., a restaurant) can be an address, or a geographic location (e.g., a set of geographic coordinates in latitude and longitude).  For example, location data associated with a user can be an address, or a
geographic location of the user's client device (e.g., as determined by IP address, cell tower triangulation, Wi-Fi positioning, Global Positioning System or GPS positioning, or any combinations of two or more of those positioning methods).  For example,
location data associated with a user can be a location of a concept related to the user (e.g., as determined by a edge between a user node of the user and a concept node of the concept).  For example, a user's location can be a location of an event that
the user is attending.  For example, a user's location can be a location of a restaurant that the user just checks in to.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store media files in data stores 101.  For example, a user can use a client application to upload a photo or a set of photos (often called a photo album), or a video or audio clip, to
the social networking system, causing the social networking system to store the photos or clips in data stores 105.  In particular embodiments, a media file stored in data stores 105 may contain metadata (often called "tags") associated with the media
file.  For example, a photo shot by a digital camera may contain metadata relating to file size, resolution, time stamp, name of the camera maker, and/or location (e.g., GPS) coordinates.  A user can add additional metadata values to a photo, or tag a
photo, during or in connection with an upload process.  Some examples of tags of a media file are author, title, comments, event names, time, location, names of people appearing in the media file, or user comment.  For example, tags of a media file can
be implemented with the Exchangeable image file format (Exif), or a modified version thereof.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,945,653, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes, describes methods of enabling a first user of a social
networking system to select a region of a photo and associate the selected region to a second user, and in response to a confirmation from the second user, storing the association in a database.  For example, the social networking system may store the
association between photo and the second user by creating an edge between a user node corresponding to the second user and a concept node corresponding to the photo, and store the edge in data stores 101.
<br/><br/> The social networking system may transmit to a user's mobile device 122 one or more images to be displayed by mobile device 122.  For example, a user may select a link (e.g., a selectable thumbnail image) in a user profile page displayed in a
graphical user interface of an application (e.g., a web browser) hosted by the user's mobile device 122, causing mobile device 122 to transmit to the social networking system a request comprising the link.  In response to the request, system front end
120 may access data stores 101 for one or more images corresponding to the link, and transmit the images to mobile device 122.  The application may display the received images in its graphical user interface.  The social networking system may store
copies of images (stored in data stores 101) in one or more content distribution networks 130.  Content distribution network 130 may comprise application server 131 operatively connected to one or more content data stores 132 storing copies of images
from the social networking system.  For example, each content data store 132 may comprise one or more storage devices.  The social networking system may communicate and access content distribution network 130, and vise versa, through network cloud 121. 
A user using mobile device 122 may communicate with content distribution network 130 through network cloud 121.  For example, in response to the user's request described above, system front end 120 of the social networking system may communicate with
content distribution network 130 (or cause mobile device 121 to communicate with content distribution network 130), causing application server 131 to access content data stores 132 for copies of the images corresponding to the link, and transmit the
copies of the images to the user's mobile device 122.
<br/><br/> A display of a mobile device can often have a display resolution relatively smaller than an original size of an image stored in the social networking system or content distribution network 130.  A display of a mobile device can often have an
aspect ratio (e.g., a ratio of width by length) different from an image stored in the social networking system or content distribution network 130.  Furthermore, an aspect ratio of a display of a mobile device may depend on an orientation (e.g., portrait
mode, or landscape mode) of the mobile device.  For example, display resolution of a mobile device can be 960 by 640 pixels in landscape mode, or 640 by 960 pixels in portrait mode, while an image stored in social networking system or content
distribution network 130 can have many sizes and aspect ratios (e.g., 1920 by 1080 pixels, 1064 by 1600 pixels, 1600 by 1200 pixels, 1200 by 1200 pixels, etc.).  In addition, different models (from different manufactures) of mobile devices can have
different display resolutions and display aspect ratios.  It is desirable to adjust an image before transmitting the image to a mobile device to reduce the image's size (for a relatively smaller display resolution of a mobile device), and thus reducing
bandwidth load for transmitting the image.  If a user of a mobile device is charged by the amount of data usage with the mobile device, reducing sizes of images that the user receives at the mobile device may also reduce the usage charge for the user. 
It is also desirable to adjust an image before transmitting the image to a mobile device to match the adjusted image's aspect ratio to an aspect ratio of a display of the mobile device.  An image adjusted for a mobile device's display resolution and
display aspect ratio may also reduce computing resource requirement for manipulating the image for displaying at the mobile device, thus improving user experience (e.g., smoother animation).  As a mobile device often runs solely on its battery, reducing
usage of computing resource of the mobile device may extend the mobile device's battery life.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments herein describe methods of adjusting images before transmitting the images to a mobile device.  Particular embodiments may adjust the images based on the mobile device's display capabilities.  FIG. 2 illustrates an example
method of adjusting images for delivery to a mobile device.  The example method of FIG. 2 can be implemented by a server-side process hosted by one or more computing devices of the social networking system.  In particular embodiments, the server-side
process may receive, from a mobile device (e.g., mobile device 122), a request for one or more images (201).  In particular embodiments, the request may comprise an identifier of the mobile device.  For example, a user may access a structured document
served by the social networking system (e.g., a user profile page, or a web page corresponding to a concept of the social networking system) in a graphical user interface of an application (e.g., a web browser) hosted by the user's mobile device.  The
user may select a link to one or more images (e.g., a selectable thumbnail image) incorporated in the structured document, causing the mobile device to transmit to the social networking system a request comprising the link.  The request may comprise an
identifier of the mobile device coded using a user-agent header field of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  Example strings of the user-agent header field for HTC Desire mobile phone by HTC Corporation and iPad tablet by Apple, Inc., are listed below,
respectively:
<br/><br/> Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.1-update1; de-de; HTC Desire 1.19.161.5 Build/ERE27) AppleWebKit/530.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/530.17
<br/><br/> Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/7B405
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the server-side process may access one or more data stores for display capabilities of the mobile device (202).  In particular embodiments, the server-side process may access the one or more data stores based on the
identifier of the mobile device.  For example, the server-side process can, based on the identifier of the mobile device, access a device description repository for display capabilities of the mobile device.  The device description repository can be
stored in a third-party website (e.g., Wireless Universal Resource FiLe or WURFL) or in data stores 101.  For example, display capabilities of a mobile device can be display resolution (in pixels) in the mobile device's display's width direction and
display resolution (in pixels) in the display's height direction.  For example, display capabilities of a mobile device can be physical sizes in millimeters (width and height) of the mobile device's display.  For example, display capabilities of a mobile
device can be whether the mobile device's display supports more than two orientations for viewing (e.g., portrait mode and landscape mode).  Particular embodiments contemplate any suitable methods of determining display capabilities of the mobile device. For example, the request (for the one or more images) may comprise display capabilities (e.g., display resolution) of the mobile device (e.g., as part of the user-agent header string of an HTTP request).
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the server-side process may access data stores 101 for the images, and adjust one or more of the images based on one or more of the display capabilities (203).  FIG. 3A illustrates an example image of a relatively high
resolution.  The example image of FIG. 3A has four objects (311, 312, 313, 314) within the image.  The objects can be people (or faces) or physical objects (e.g., vases, buildings, etc.).  In particular embodiments, the server-side process may adjust an
image by scaling the image.  For example, the server-side process can scale down the image of FIG. 3A to be within a mobile device's relatively low display resolution.  By scaling downward and reducing the image's size, particular embodiments can reduce
bandwidth requirement for transmitting the image to the mobile device.  The scaled image may leave white space (321) if the image's aspect ratio does not match the display's aspect ratio, as illustrated in FIG. 3B.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the server-side process may adjust an image by cropping the image.  For example, the server-side process can identify objects in the image of FIG. 3A (e.g., by using a face recognition software or an object recognition
software), identify a region of the image that includes the objects and is of a same aspect ratio of the mobile device's display, and remove (crop) the portion outside the identified region from the image.  By cropping and reducing the image's size,
particular embodiments can accentuate subject matter of the image (e.g., the four objects in the example image of FIG. 3A) and reduce bandwidth requirement for transmitting the image to the mobile device.  FIGS. 3C-3D illustrate example cropped images of
the example image of FIG. 3A.  FIG. 3C illustrates an example cropped image in a landscape mode of the mobile device.  FIG. 3D illustrates an example cropped image in a portrait mode of the mobile device.  Particular embodiments may determine cropping an
image for delivery to a mobile device in a landscape mode, or in a portrait mode, or in both landscape and portrait modes (i.e., producing two cropped images for each mode respectively) based device capabilities of the mobile device, a preference of a
user of the mobile device, a preference of an application displaying the image on the mobile device, or any combinations of these factors.  For example, if the mobile device may have a default orientation (e.g., portrait mode), the server-side process
can crop an image for delivery to the mobile device in the default orientation.  For example, a user of the mobile device may prefer viewing photos in portrait mode with the mobile device and store his/her preference in data stores 101.  Or a client
application hosted by the mobile device can determine a preferred orientation based on the user's usage patterns, and transmit to the social networking system a message comprising the user's preferred orientation, causing the social networking system to
store the user's preferred orientation in data stores 101.  Or the social networking system can determine a preferred orientation based on the user's usage patterns, and store the user's preferred orientation in data stores 101.  The server-side process
can access data stores 101 (e.g., based on a user identifier included in the request for the image) for the user's preference, and crop the image in the preferred orientation (e.g., portrait mode).  For example, a photo-viewing application of the mobile
device may have a preferred orientation (e.g., landscape mode) stored in data stores 101.  The server-side process can access data stores 101 (e.g., based on an application identifier included in the request of the image) for the preferred orientation,
and crop the image in the preferred orientation (e.g., landscape mode).  For example, if there is not preferred orientation for displaying, the server-side process may crop the image in both landscape and portrait modes--i.e., producing one cropped image
in landscape mode and one cropped image in portrait mode for delivery to the mobile device.
<br/><br/> Instead of display capabilities of a mobile device, particular embodiments may adjust an image for delivery to the mobile device based on a size of a container (e.g., a frame, a window) displaying the image at the mobile device.  For example, an
application hosted by the mobile device may display the image in a frame overlaying a web page in the application's graphical user interface.  The mobile device may transmit to the social networking system a request including a size (e.g., length and
width) of the container.  In response to the request, the server-side process can scale or crop the image to fit within the size of the container.  In other embodiments, the server-side process may determine a size of a container for an image based on
display capabilities of the mobile device, a particular layout of a structured document display the web page, user interface capabilities of the mobile device (e.g., a touch screen or a click wheel), data transmission to the mobile device (e.g., a
cellular network or a Wi-Fi network), or any combination of two or more of these factors.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may adjust an image for delivery to a mobile device based on one or more social contacts of a user of the mobile device.  For example, particular embodiments may crop the image to include only one or more social contacts
of the user.  For example, the server-side process may receive a request for the example image of FIG. 3A from a user's mobile device.  The server-side process may access data stores 101 (e.g., based on a user identifier included in the request) and
identify object 313 as a face of the user (e.g., by using a facial recognition software to compare the example image to the user's profile picture stored in data stores 101).  The server-side process may access social graph information stored in data
stores 101, and identify (e.g., by using a facial recognition software or an object recognition software to compare the example image to images stored in data stores 101) one or more other objects in the example image of FIG. 3A that are within a
pre-determined threshold degree of separation from the user.  For example, the server-side process may identify object 312 as a first-degree friend of the user.  For example, the server-side process may identify object 312 as a celebrity that the user
likes (e.g., as there is an edge connecting a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the celebrity in the social graph).  The server-side process can crop the example image of FIG. 3A to include only objects 313 and 314
(and fit within the size of the mobile device's display or a container), as illustrated in FIG. 3E.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may adjust an image for delivery to a mobile device based on location data indicating a location of a user associated with the mobile device.  For example, the server-side process may receive a request for the example
image of FIG. 3A from a user's mobile device.  The server-side process may access data stores 101 and identify objects 313 as a face of the user.  The server-side process may access data stores 101 for the user's location (e.g., the user is currently in
Paris, or the example image is from a photo album for the user's trip to Paris).  The server-side process may access data stores 101 for images of physical objects of the user's location and identify one or more objects in the example image related to
the user's location.  For example, the server-side process may identify object 314 as a physical object (e.g., Arc de Triomphe) of the user's location (e.g., Paris), and crop the example image of FIG. 3A to include only objects 313 and 314 (and fit
within the size of the mobile device's display or a container), as illustrated in FIG. 3F.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may adjust one or more images for delivery to a mobile device based on portions of those images that will have other elements overlaid on them once rendered on a web page.  For example, a web page may contain 2 overlapping
images by design.  For example, the server-side process may crop the image at the back to only include portions of the image that are visible once the front image is overlaid on top of it.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may rotate images through a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) space based on a desired appearance on a mobile device, before delivery to the mobile device.  Mobile devices are capable of rotating images once
downloaded, although the cost of doing so may be prohibitive in terms of scrolling speed and processor utilization.  For example, a web page may have an image rotated by 30 degrees counterclockwise.  In particular embodiments, the server-side process may
rotate the image, before transmitting the image to the mobile device.  For example, an image may be rotated so as to appear to `lift off` the page by rotating in 3D space.  In particular embodiments, the server-side process may calculate this 3D
rotation, creating a rotated image based on the calculation, and transmit the rotated image to the mobile device.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may apply one or more filters to an image based on a desired effect, before delivery the image to a mobile device.  For example, a filter can be an adjustment in hue, brightness, or color level of an image.  For example, a
filter can display pixels within an image to produce a desired effect (e.g., a funhouse-mirror effect, or removing blurriness of an image).  Particular embodiments contemplate any suitable image filers.  In particular embodiments, the server-side process
may apply one or more filters to an image based on a desired effect, and transmit the filtered image to the mobile device.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments contemplate any combination of adjustments to an image for delivery the image to a mobile device.  For example, the server-side process may first scale down the example image of FIG. 3A and than crop the example image to
include not only the objects (e.g., 311, 312, 313, and 314) but also a portion of the environment surrounding the objects.  The scaled and cropped image can provide a clear view of the objects and a context about what the objects were doing at the time
when the image was taken.  For example, the server-side process may crop, scale, rotate, and apply a filter to an image, before transmitting the image to a mobile device.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may adjust one or more images for delivery to a mobile device based on existing tags in the one or more images.  For example, particular embodiments may crop an image based on one or more tagged region within the image. 
As described earlier, a region of an image can be tagged or associated to a user by using the methods described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,945,653.  For example, the server-side process may receive a request for the example image of FIG. 3A from a user's
mobile device.  The server-side process may access the image (stored in data stores 101) and identify a region being tagged to the user (e.g., region 320 as illustrated in FIG. 3G).  The server-side process can crop the example image of FIG. 3A to
include the region tagged to the user (and fit within the size of the mobile device's display or a container), as illustrated in FIG. 3G.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may adjust one or more images for delivery to a mobile device based on image quality of the one or more images.  For example, in response to a user's request, the server-side process may access a photo album (e.g., from a
rock concert) and create a photo mosaic as illustrated in FIG. 3I.  For example, the server-side process may determine a shading level (e.g., by using an image processing software) for each image for the mosaic, and arrange the images based on
alternating shading levels, as illustrated in FIG. 3I.  In addition, for example, the server-side process may identify one or more photos (from the photo album) with one or more faces (or physical objects) corresponding to users (or concepts) that are
within a pre-determined degree separation from the user (e.g., the user's first-degree friends).  The server-side process can arrange the identified photos (i.e., photos with objects more relevant to the user) in larger tiles (e.g., 351, 352) of the
mosaic illustrated in FIG. 3I.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the server-side process may transmit to the mobile device one or more of the images as adjusted (204).  For example, in response to a request for delivery to a mobile device the example image of FIG. 3A, the
server-side process may adjust the example image based on the mobile device's display capabilities, and transmit one or more adjusted images (e.g., the example image of FIG. 3E) to the mobile device to be presented in the mobile device's display.  In
some embodiments, the server-side process may store (or cache) the adjusted copies of the images in data stores 101.  For example, in response to a request for an image for delivery to a mobile device (201), the server-side process may access one or more
data stores for display capabilities of the mobile device (202), or determine display capabilities of the mobile device as described earlier, and access data stores 101 for adjusted copies of the image that may match the display capabilities of the
mobile device.  If a matched copy of the image is found, the server-side process can transmit the matched copy to the mobile device (204).
<br/><br/> The example method of FIG. 2 can be implemented with content distribution network 130.  For example, in one embodiment, the server-side process may receive a request for delivery to a mobile device one or more images (201), access one or more
data stores for display capabilities of the mobile device (202), or determine display capabilities of the mobile device as described earlier, and determine adjustment parameters (e.g., cropping size, cropping coordinates) of one or more of the images
based the display capabilities.  The server-side process may transmit to the mobile device a message comprising adjustment parameters for one or more of the images and a pointer or identifier of copies of the images stored in content distribution network
130.  For example, the message may comprise an URL including cropping size or coordinates for the images.  The mobile device may transmit the message to content distribution network 130.  In response to the message, application server 131 (or another
server-side process hosted by one or more computing devices of content distribution network 130) may access content data stores 132 for copies of the images, adjust one or more of the images based on the adjustment parameters (203).  Alternatively,
Application server 131 may access data stores 132 for adjusted copies of the images that match the adjustment parameters.  Application server 131 may transmit to the mobile device one or more of the images as adjusted (204).  Application Server 131 may
store (or cache) the adjusted copies of the images in data stores 132 for later use as described earlier.
<br/><br/> By way of example and not by way of limitation, example URL's including adjustment parameters are provided here.  For example, an URL for an image of a size of 720.times.537 can be:
http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/208352_10100149240258148_272- 9237_49967111_8099422_n.jpg An URL below illustrates example cropping parameters.  In this example URL, (183, 0) are the coordinates of the top-left corner of a crop box and
537.times.537 is a size of the crop box.  The resulting image size is 537.times.537.  http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/c183.0.537.537/208352_101001- 49240258148_2729237_49967111_8099422_n.jpg An URL below illustrates example scaling
parameters.  In this example URL, 180.times.540 defines a size of a box.  A server-side process can scale down the image while preserving aspect ratio until the image can be fully contained in the box.  The resulting image size is 180.times.134. 
http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/s180x540/208352_101001492402- 58148_2729237_49967111_8099422_n.jpg An example URL below includes both cropping and scaling parameters The resulting image size is 180.times.180. 
http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/c183.0.537.537/s180x540/2083- 52_10100149240258148_2729237_49967111_8099422_n.jpg
<br/><br/> Yet in another embodiments, the server-side process may transmit to the mobile device a message (e.g., an URL) comprising a pointer or identifier of copies of the images stored in content distribution network 130.  The mobile device may transmit
the message to content distribution network 130.  Alternatively, the mobile device may transmit a request for one or more images to content distribution network 130 (e.g., an URL for an image can point directly to content distribution network 130).  In
response to the message (or the direct request), application server 131 (or another server-side process hosted by one or more computing devices of content distribution network 130) may access one or more data stores for display capabilities of the mobile
device (202), or determine display capabilities of the mobile device as described earlier, and adjust one or more of the images based on the display capabilities (203).  Alternatively, Application server 131 may access content data stores 132 for
adjusted copies of the images (that may match the display capabilities of the mobile device).  Application server 131 may transmit to the mobile device one or more of the images as adjusted (204).  Application Server 131 may store (or cache) the adjusted
copies of the images in data stores 132 for later use as described earlier.
