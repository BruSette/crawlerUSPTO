<br/><br/>STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT NOT APPLICABLE
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> 1.  Field of the Invention
<br/><br/> The Cascade Windows Software.TM.  (a trademark of Applicant) Technology and The Cascade Windows.TM.  GUI (Graphical User Interface) Operating System are a series of processes and methods programmed as custom code that allows seamless
multifunctional interactions between a user and a mobile interactive electronic machine.  The instant invention comprises source code that is convertible to executables, as is known in the art.  The Cascade Windows GUI (Graphical User Interface)
Operating System utilizes Cascade Windows and system hardware (E.g. the device's touchscreen, the device's speaker(s), the device's microphone(s), and/or the device's camera system) to receive inputs from a user, which is in-turn processed by a
microprocessor with one or more cores and displayed as output and/or visual widgets on a screen display of a mobile interactive computing device (E.g. smartphones, electronic display gaming devices and controllers, electronic tablets, portable media
players, and wearable computers--glasses, and watches .  . . etc.).  These Cascade Windows have adjustable dimensions which are altered by various commands and instructions designated by the mobile user through finger movements above or on a keypad
and/or on a touchscreen interface, and/or by voice and/or eye commands by the user; which allows the user to expand, minimize, move, open, close, refresh, and scroll sequences of actions &amp; screen configurations, Applications (APPS), and/or systems on the
mobile device so that the user can efficiently and effortlessly multi-task while operating the mobile device system; creating a seamless, multifunctional, ubiquitous, and amorphous interface which gives a powerful source of ambidextrous communication to
mobile users.  This has not been predicated in mobile interactive computing devices, like smartphones, tablets, and gaming devices/controllers currently available in the commercial market; as such the instant invention which utilizes Cascade Windows,
ergonomics, and intuitive applications on a screen display in a GUI (Graphical User Interface) System for mobile devices, like smartphones, would be well received.
<br/><br/> This invention relates generally to a method, system, and apparatus relating to a Cascade Software Technology.TM.  which allows the user to simultaneously open and operate various systems and Applications (APPS) accessed and activated via a
mobile phone/device and/or a globally accessible network.  The Cascade Software Technology arranges the active interface of various mobile phone/device systems (E.g. the Phone System, the Media/Internet System, and/or the Multi-cast Communication System)
and/or Applications (APPS) that run on the mobile phone/device into adjustable dimension windows opened on the mobile phone/device screen so that they either overlap each other, are adjacent to each other, are adjacent to each other sharing a common
boarder(s), and/or are collapsed configurations that are movable on the screen.  These Cascade Windows have adjustable dimensions which are altered by various commands and instructions designated by the user through finger movements on or above a keypad,
and/or on a touch screen interface, and/or by voice and/or eye commands by the user.  These Cascade Windows have "ghosted" (transparent) title menu bars (which gives the user various options concerning the orientation of the window(s) on the screen
and/or the display of an iterative step in displaying the window(s) in a designated area on the display so that the user can choose between the processes of opening or closing windows that occurred in successive stages on the display, each of which was
dependent on the preceding one, and produced a culminating technical effect).  The Ghost Title Menu Bars.TM.  (a Trademark of the Applicant) become visible to the user when the user activates that area of the Cascade Window by selecting the particular
window by implementing various preset commands with the mobile machine, which includes (but is not limited to): touching a command on a keypad, touching the window's area on a touch screen, speaking a command, and/or performing various commands via eye
movements.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of the Background Art
<br/><br/> The use of "windows" GUI's (Graphical User Interfaces) on a computer screen to open programs and work simultaneously in various programs by overlapping open windows on the computer screen or minimizing them using a title control bar onto a menu
bar on the bottom of the computer screen is well known in the art and is widely used on PC's and implemented by Microsoft Corporation in a series of PC operating systems produced by the company, in 1985 to present; but this concept has not been
implemented on mobile smartphones/devices.  Several vendors have created their own windowing systems based on independent code, with basic elements in common that define the WIMP (Window, Icon, Menu, "Pointing device," Paradigm).  In the latest version
of Microsoft's Windows Vista and Windows mobile OS (Operating System) Windows phone 7; window management is represented via a rolodex-style flipping mechanism.  In both cases the operating system transforms the windows on-the-fly while continuing to
update the content of those windows.
<br/><br/> The Cascade Software.TM.  Technology Invention and The Cascade Windows.TM.  GUI Operating System is created for use on various mobile phones/device(s) such as The SS Mobile Smartphone.TM.  (a Mobile Smartphone Design patent Pending by The
Inventor--U.S.  29/439,095), and allows users to execute multiple graphical applications on a mobile phone/device at the same time, through cooperative multitasking (a method in computing where multiple tasks, also known as processes, share common
processing resources such as a CPU).
<br/><br/> Designing the visual composition and temporal behavior of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) is an important part of software application programming in the area of human-computer interaction.  Its goal is to enhance the efficiency and ease of use
for the underlying logical design of a stored program, a design discipline known as usability.  Methods of user-centered design are used to ensure that the visual language introduced in the design is well tailored to the tasks.  Typically, the user
interacts with information by manipulating visual widgets that allow for interactions appropriate to the kind of data they hold.  The widgets of a well-designed interface are selected to support the actions necessary to achieve the goals of the user.  A
GUI (Graphical User Interface) may be designed for the requirements of a vertical market as application-specific graphical user interfaces (E.g. ATM's, POS--Point of Sale at restaurants, RTOS--Real Time Operating Systems).
<br/><br/> Unlike most GUI designs for smartphones and electronic gaming devices/controllers that require toggling back and forth from an application, program, or screen display, to a home screen, to another application, program, or screen display, as on
the latest version of the iPhone (iPhone 5), or from a back-button, to a screen of scrollable dormant or idle applications, programs or display, such as on the Windows mobile phone 7.5, and 8; The Cascade Software Technology.TM.  allows the user to
simultaneously open, view, and operate various systems and Applications (APPS) accessed and activated via a mobile phone/device and/or a locally or globally accessible network.  The Cascade Software Technology arranges the active interface of various
mobile phone/device systems (the Phone System, the Media/Internet System, and/or the Multicast Communication System) and/or Applications (APPS) that run on the mobile phone/device into adjustable dimension windows opened on the mobile phone/device
screen, so that they either overlap each other, are adjacent to each other, are adjacent to each other sharing a common border(s), and/or are collapsed configurations that are movable on the screen.  These Cascade Windows have adjustable dimensions which
are altered by various commands and instructions designated by the mobile user through finger movements on or above a keypad and/or on a touchscreen interface, and/or by voice and/or eye commands by the user; which allows the user to expand, minimize,
move, open, close, refresh, and scroll sequences of actions, Applications (APPS), or systems on the mobile phone/device simultaneously so that the user can efficiently and effortlessly multi-task while operating the mobile phone/device system; creating a
seamless, multifunctional, ubiquitous, and amorphous interface which gives a powerful source of ambidextrous communication to mobile users.
<br/><br/> This invention The Cascade Software Technology.TM.  is related to U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,162,696 which is titled: "Method And System For Creating, Using And Modifying Multifunctional Website Hotspots," filed on Jun.  8, 2001 which claims the benefit
of provisional application Ser.  No.: 60/210,300 filed Jun.  8, 2000.  The ClickVideoShop.TM.  patent (U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,162,696) comprises an apparatus, system and method for creating multifunctional hotspots preferably for use in conjunction with
digital media files, such as prerecorded and live-streamed audio and/or video, or other website content.  The software of the "716" patent preferably facilitates the use of a digital media file, such as a digital video source or video stream, as a
conduit for accessing related or targeted information through multifunctional hotspots imbedded or residing therein.  The multifunctional hotspots may access information within the user's system, or a globally accessible network or over any local area
network.  The invention uses Multicast Windows that are controlled by a mode control bar, and are activated and appear only when the video is placed in a particular mode (E.G. Bid Mode--in a Multicast Communication Window, CoolDigiCall.TM.  Mode--in a
Calling System Window, and/or ClickVideoShop.TM.  Mode--in a Media/Internet System Window); the shape of the video or media area, Multicast Windows, and general layout of the entertainment area as defined by the "716" patent are subject to design change. Therefore, the instant invention, The Cascade Software.TM.  Technology and The Cascade Windows.TM.  GUI Operating System as described herein would be well received in the mobile smartphone/device market.  Consequently, there exist a need for the
technology The Cascade Windows.TM.  GUI Operating System and its' intuitive applications to provide a seamless interface between Device Application Programs and Device Systems (internal and external hardware--E.G. the device's microprocessor, the
device's memory, the device's touchscreen, the device's microphone(s), the device's speaker(s), and/or the device's camera system) of mobile interactive devices (E.G. smartphones, gaming devices &amp; controllers, electronic tablets, portable media players,
and wearable computing devices--glasses, watches .  . . etc.) so that multi-tasking complex tasks, working on large amounts of data simultaneously, and/or playing interactive games is far more efficient and effortless; whereby illuminating the user
experience.

learning routines, and multitasking utilizing Cascade Windows on an electronic high resolution screen display in a mobile electronic interactive device GUI (Graphical User Interface) System; where the Cascade Windows created and displayed by The Cascade
Software Technology Invention arranges the active interface of various mobile phone/device systems (the Phone System, the Media/Internet System, and/or the Multi-cast Communication System) and/or applications (APPS) that run on the mobile phone/device,
into adjustable dimension windows opened on the mobile phone/device screen so that they either overlap each other, are adjacent to each other, are adjacent to each other sharing a common border(s), and/or are collapsed configurations that are movable on
the screen.  These Cascade Windows have adjustable dimensions which are altered by various commands and instructions designated automatically based on the preset configuration of the mobile phone, the orientation of The GUI or sequence of events which
has occurred on the GUI and by the user; or by the user through finger movements on a keypad, and/or on a touch screen interface, or by voice and/or eye commands by the user.  These Cascade Windows have "ghosted" title menu bars, which gives the user
various options concerning the orientation of the window on the screen and/or the display of an iterative step, in displaying the window(s) in a designated area on the display so that the user can choose between the processes of opening or closing
windows that occurred in successive stages on the display.  The Cascade Windows Software.TM.  Technology Invention allows users to execute and operate multiple graphical applications and programs on a mobile phone/device at the same time, through
cooperative multitasking (a method in computing where multiple tasks, also known as processes, share common processing resources such as a CPU).  The Invention is created to be mobile platform independent (Android, iPhone, Windows, Blackberry, and/or
Symbian .  . . etc.) and has a landscape native orientation for the screen display; but can also operate effectively in a portrait screen display orientation.
<br/><br/> The Cascade Software Technology Invention is streamlined and advanced mobile software technology that creates linked system activities and intuitive applications that creates for the mobile user, what is coined by the Inventor as a
Smart-Screen.TM.  (a Trademark of the Applicant), which efficiently and effectively implements multi-tasking routines by The Cascade Software System and allows multifunctional operation of various systems and applications by the user.  The Cascade
Windows generated by the software and that occupy native specific areas on the screen and GUI (Graphical User Interface) are 1.) The Telephone System and any application (APP) related to this system, 2.) The Media/Internet System and any application
(APP) related to this system, and 3.) The Multicast Communication System and any application (APP) related to this system.  The Cascade Windows generated by the software are native to specific areas or regions on the mobile phone/device screen (but are
adjustable based on user preferences) and GUI (Graphical User Interface); but are expandable into other areas of the screen display and GUI to give the mobile user an expanded Cascade System Configuration, and a larger adjusted dimension Cascade Window
for the expanded system.  The Cascade Windows have adjustable dimensions which are altered by various commands and instructions designated automatically based on the user's preset configuration of the mobile phone/device, the orientation or sequence of
events which has occurred on the GUI and by the user; and/or by the user through finger movements on or above a keypad, and/or on a touch screen interface, and/or by voice and/or eye commands by the user.  These Cascade Windows have "ghosted" (visible
only when the window is touched or activated) title menu bars, which gives the user various options concerning the orientation of the window on the screen and/or the display of an iterative step, in displaying the window(s) in a designated area on the
display so that the user can choose between the processes of opening or closing windows that occurred in successive stages on the display.
<br/><br/> The Cascade Windows.TM.  Operating system provides an interface between an application program and the mobile interactive machine hardware, so that an application program can interact with the hardware only by obeying rules and procedures
programmed into The Cascade Software (OS) Operating System.  The Cascade Operating System is also a set of services which simplify development and execution of application programs.  Executing an application program involves the creation of a process by
the Operating System kernel which assigns memory space and other resources, establishes a priority for the process in the multi-tasking systems, loads program binary code into memory and initiates execution of the application program which then interacts
with the user and with hardware devices.  The instant invention The Cascade Windows Software.TM.  and Operating System supports thread computing like multi-threading which is a widespread programming and execution model that allows multiple threads to
exist within the context of a single process.  These threads share the process resources, but are able to execute independently; when it is applied to a single process it enables parallel execution on a multi-processing system.  The Cascade Software.TM. 
multi-threaded application(s) are pieces of software that are aware of more than one core microprocessor, and can use these microprocessors to be able to simultaneously complete multiple tasks.  In accordance with these other objects, which will become
apparent hereinafter, the instant invention will now be described with particular reference to the accompanying drawings. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> With reference to the drawings, FIGS. 1A-1F and 2A-2E disclose the preferred embodiments of the instant invention which is generally referenced by FIGS. 1-78, and/or as The Cascade Software.TM.  and/or The Cascade Windows.TM.  GUI Operating
System (Trademarks of the Applicant).  The instant invention, FIGS. 1-78, comprises an interactive software based system and device having microprocessor readable code 100 and/or 200, as shown in FIGS. 1A-1F and 2A-2E, respectively stored on a tangible
portable interactive electronic device storage medium that executes custom programs and data for a user by creating, displaying, storing, modifying, performing adaptive learning routines and multitasking utilizing Cascade Windows on an electronic screen
display.  The instant invention FIGS. 1-78, embodies a method for processing custom programs and data for a user by creating and displaying Cascade Windows on a high resolution screen.  The method of storing, modifying, performing adaptive learning
routines, and multitasking utilizing Cascade Windows is shown in the software flow diagrams FIGS. 1A-1F and 2A-2E, respectively.  The software of the invention 100, and 200 and/or the corresponding applications are platform independent and may be defined
in one or more interactive mobile smartphones/devices.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 1A-1F the logic and operation of the preferred software 200 of the instant invention FIGS. 1-78 is shown.  In reference to FIG. 1A, The Cascade Software determines whether the smartphone/device is on and/or in sleep-mode, the
software then determines if the user has activated the mobile device interface at which time the instant invention, The Cascade Software System.TM., reads preset configuration data of the machine and default parameters stored in the mobile device's
microprocessor, and displays the output screen configuration on the mobile device's high resolution screen display (212-222).  The Cascade Software System.TM.  and The Cascade Windows.TM.  GUI Operating System determines from stored parameters in the
microprocessor and memory, along with inputs from the user, whether the smartphone/device was powered-on or was in sleep-mode and activated by the user so that either the defaulted home screen or last user screen configuration is displayed for
interaction with the user (222-228).  While the appropriate screen is displayed, The Cascade Software and Operating System continuously monitors based on preset parameters stored in memory whether the user has activated a particular System of the
smartphone/device, and/or a particular application, and/or the Ghost-Menu.TM.  (a transparent menu bar that is located at the top perimeter of System and/or Application Windows, which appears when the user activates the particular area of the System
and/or Window via various command definitions saved in the device's memory (FIGS. 10, 12, 23-24, 45-46, 61, and 65-70)) for a particular System and/or Application which would give the user interactive options to alter the orientation of the designated
System and/or Application Window being cascaded on the high resolution display by providing visual widgets on the Ghosted-Menu.TM.  bar (FIGS. 2B-2C; 110-122; Provisional application, FIG. 11, Item 22) that allow for interactions appropriate to the kind
of data they hold (228-236).  The Cascade Software System determines from user inputs whether the Phone System has been activated, if yes, then the device displays as output on the screen display the Phone System in its' defaulted area based on preset
parameters and custom code (as shown in FIG. 2), in response to the user's interaction (230).  The Cascade Software continuously monitors whether there is another call attempting to establish contact, if yes, the software initiates a connection for audio
and/or video communication and maintains the connection, if no, The Cascade Software.TM.  determines whether the user and/or smartphone/device has entered another contact number to call, if yes, The Cascade Software initiates a connection for audio
and/or video communication and maintains the connection.  The software and mobile device continuously monitors during the phone process whether the user has activated another System Button (FIG. 3; and Provisional application, FIG. 3, Items 8-12) and/or
Application, and/or whether the user and/or smartphone/device has manipulated (drag and expand, stacked on top of another screen configuration and/or System, enlarged, and/or minimized (as shown FIGS. 10-11, 15-19, 20-28, 30-32, and 65-70)) the active
and/or any cascaded window being displayed in any configuration (FIGS. 1A-1B), (236-250), (110-123).  The Cascade Software System.TM.  and The Cascade Windows.TM.  GUI Operating System has incorporated within custom code stored in the device's memory
parameters that enable the device to operate intuitively based on the user's behavior or a pattern of the user that is detected by the device and processed; by comparing preset parameters, inputs, and desired outputs from the user over a specific time
interval.  The device organizes these window patterns (E.G. screen configurations and other data) by a microprocessor, which compares the data based on information stored in memory and then archives the window patterns/configurations and/or other
relevant data into the device's memory so that the user can easily choose between the processes of opening and/or closing windows cascaded on the display screen; by selecting and activating the Cascade Button located on any Ghost-Menu Bar (FIGS. 46-58). 
This visual widget, The Cascade Button, which is programmed to allow the user to access the neatly organized window patterns/configurations and/or sequence of events which occurred on the GUI (Graphical User Interface) in successive stages creates a
culminating effect for the user which allows them to efficiently access various screen configurations and actions that occurred over time (111-113).  The Cascade Software can also automatically launch a System and cascade it on the display based on the
comparisons made by the processor between information and parameters stored in memory and user interactions and/or inputs (250).  The Cascade Software continues the process of determining user inputs, including whether another system has been activated
by the user.  If the user activates the Internet/Media System and/or a related Application the Cascade Software displays The Internet/Media System and/or related Application in its' defaulted area (as shown in FIG. 2), and continues to monitor whether
the user has inputted actions through the GUI on the screen display to alter the orientation (drag and expand, stacked on top of another screen configuration and/or System, enlarged, and/or minimized (as shown in FIGS. 10-11, 15-19, 20-28, 30-32, and
65-70)) of The Systems and/or Applications opened on the high resolution screen display (252-260).  When The Internet/Media System is activated The Cascade Software.TM.  automatically launches the web browser, if the user and/or smartphone/device makes a
search query, The Cascade Software displays the search results and/or the URL in the Internet Display System, and continually monitors whether the user and/or smartphone/device has made another search query (254-268) (as shown in FIGS. 1C-1F, and FIGS.
5-9).  The Cascade Software continually monitors by a single or multiple core microprocessor whether the user and/or smartphone/device has activated another System and/or Application.  If the user and/or smartphone/device activates The Multicast/Bidding
System and/or a related Application, the Cascade Software will process the input(s) and display the System in its defaulted area (as shown in FIG. 2), and determine whether a multicast session was entered (274-288).  If the user and/or smartphone entered
a multicast session The Cascade Software.TM.  displays and enables a secure multicast/bidding session for the user (288) (as shown in FIG. 1D).  The Cascade Software.TM.  and The Cascade Windows.TM.  GUI Operating System supports and executes through
custom programs and parameters stored in memory, in conjunction with hardware chips and/or "tags;" instructions executed by a microprocessor to facilitate Near Field Communications, Wi-Fi, and/or Bluetooth Technology between various endpoints (other
smartphones/devices--E.G. Digital Tv's, Video Gaming/Controller units, Entertainment Systems, Electronic Tablets and/or Toys) and monitors user inputs and signals that may exist when other communicating devices come into range (254, 280, 132-134), (as
shown by FIG. 2D), (as shown by FIGS. 40-45, 58-60, and 70-75).  The software also monitors the user/device inputs, to determine whether a connection to the cloud based system, The Digital Locker (a trademark of the Applicant) was established; if yes
then the software and mobile device connects to the cloud based system, enables and displays the contents of the user's Digital Locker, monitors if the user has activated a multimedia and/or a file and/or if one or more multimedia and/or files are
currently open (292) (123), if the user and/or device has enabled multifunctional hotspots (125-132) and maintains the connection until the user ends the session (290-300), (as shown in FIG. 1E), (as shown in the FIGS. 33-43).
<br/><br/> The instant invention The Cascade Windows Software.TM.  and Operating System supports thread computing, like multi-threading which is a widespread programming and execution model that allows multiple threads to exist within the context of a
single process.  These threads share the process resources, but are able to execute independently; when it is applied to a single process it enables parallel execution on a multi-processing system.  The Cascade Software.TM.  multi-threaded Application(s)
are pieces of software that are aware of more than one core microprocessor, and can use these microprocessors to be able to simultaneously complete multiple tasks.  In accordance with these other objects, which will become apparent hereinafter, the
instant invention will now be described with particular reference to FIGS. 2A-2E (which occurs simultaneously to the process described by FIGS. 1A-1F), referring to the logic and operation of the preferred software 100 of the instant invention FIGS. 1-78
is shown.  In reference to FIG. 2A, The Cascade Software determines whether the smartphone/device is on and/or in sleep-mode, the software then determines if the user has activated the mobile device interface at which time the instant invention, The
Cascade Software System.TM., reads preset configuration data of the machine and default parameters stored in the mobile device's microprocessor(s), and displays the output screen configuration on the mobile device's high resolution screen display
(100-109).  The Cascade Software System.TM.  and The Cascade Windows.TM.  GUI Operating System determines from stored parameters in the microprocessor(s) and memory, along with inputs from the user, whether the smartphone/device was powered-on or was in
sleep-mode and activated by the user so that either the defaulted home screen (as shown in FIGS. 3-4) or the last user screen configuration is displayed (from memory) for interaction with the user (106-108).  While the appropriate screen is displayed,
The Cascade Software and Operating System continuously monitors based on preset parameters stored in memory whether the user has activated a particular System of the smartphone/device, and/or a particular Application, and/or the Ghost-Menu.TM.  (a
transparent menu bar that is located at the top perimeter of System and/or Application Windows, which appears when the user activates the particular area of the System and/or Window via various command definitions saved in the device's memory (FIGS. 10,
12, 23-24, 45-46, 61, and 65-70)) for a particular System and/or Application which would give the user interactive options to alter the orientation of the designated System and/or Application Window being cascaded on the high resolution display by
providing visual widgets on the Ghosted-Menu.TM.  bar (FIGS. 2B-2C, 110-122; Provisional Application, FIG. 11, Item 22) that allow for interactions appropriate to the kind of data they hold (109-122).  The software and mobile device continuously monitors
during the user's interaction with the mobile device, whether the user has activated another System Button (FIG. 3; and Provisional application, FIG. 3, Items 8-12) and/or Application, and/or whether the user and/or smartphone/device has manipulated
(drag and expand, stacked on top of another screen configuration and/or System, enlarged, and/or minimized (as shown FIGS. 10-11, 15-19, 20-28, 30-32, and 65-70)) the active and/or any cascaded window being displayed in any screen configuration (FIGS.
1A-1B), (236-250), (FIGS. 2A-2D), (110-123).  During Near Field Communication, Wi-Fi, and/or Bluetooth connectivity with one or more endpoints (other smartphones/devices--E. G. Digital Tv's, Video Gaming/Controller units, Entertainment Systems,
Electronic Tablets and/or Toys) the mobile device can bridge and maintain a connection with the desired endpoint(s), display its screen on and/or through the endpoint(s), interact and/or communicate with the endpoint(s), and/or control the functionality
of the endpoints (E.G. act as a remote control).  (as shown by FIGS. 2C-2E), (125-136), and (as shown by FIGS. 40-45, 58-60, and 70-75).
<br/><br/> The Cascade Software.TM.  arranges the active interface of various mobile smartphone/device systems (the Phone System, the Media/Internet System, and/or the Multicast Communication System) and/or Applications (APPS) that run on the mobile
smartphone/device into adjustable dimension windows opened on the mobile smartphone/device screen so that they either overlap each other, are adjacent to each other, are adjacent to each other sharing a common border(s), and/or are collapsed
configurations that are movable on the screen.  Thus, The Cascade Windows and interface may be programmed to perform various actions that orient the system windows and/or APPS on the mobile device screen in such a way that they occupy specific areas on
the GUI, as shown in the drawings of The Provisional Patent Application 61/687,035--FIGS. 1-3, FIG. 2, Items 2-4, and FIG. 3, Items 5-7, (which shows the orientation of APPS, related to each system, and how they occupy the same area the system is
initially opened within).  Each system (the Phone System, the Media/Internet System, and the Multi-cast System) is opened by activating system control buttons, as shown in the drawings of The Provisional Patent Application 61/687,035--FIG. 3, Items 8-12,
or by eye and/or voice commands.  The Cascade Software System.TM.  allows each system (the Phone System, the Media/Internet System, and the Multi-cast System) once opened to interact with applications (APPS) related to that particular system or other
threaded and/or singular APPS based on the mobile user's preset preferences, and can perform standard functions like emailing, messaging, and surfing the Internet efficiently, without the need of toggling from one screen to the next; as shown in the
drawings of The Provisional Patent Application 61/687,035--FIG. 4, Items 13-15, FIGS. 5-7.
<br/><br/> The Cascade Software System.TM.  allows each system (The Phone System, Media/Internet System, and the Multi-cast System) to operate independently or as linked or grouped systems, so that multitasking is effortless and applications (APPS) become
intuitive applications based on the mobile user's preset preferences, prior actions, and anticipated actions or need (based on learned characteristics of the mobile user).  For example, a mobile user could activate all three systems (the Phone System,
the Media/Internet System, and the Multi-cast System) key in a search term in an Internet Browser, search the term, open a video link about or related to the search term, access a phone contact list directory from a social network application, call a
contact person on the list, link them to the search results and playing video, see, hear, and speak to the callee on the screen and send a text message about the video and search results during the process, some of which could be done automatically by
the mobile device through learned characteristics of the user and/or preset configurations of the mobile device by the user(s); as shown in the drawings of The Provisional Patent Application 61/687,035--FIGS. 7-11; See Also.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,162,696;
Summary of the Invention, Column 3, lines 1-65; Detailed Description of the Invention, Column 5, lines 4-67, and Column 6, lines 1-67.  The Cascade Software.TM.  allows windows to be "stacked" (overlapped) in neat orientations based on usage priority,
moved or expanded to derive an expanded window or more system features related to the window being moved or expanded; as shown in the drawings of The Provisional Patent Application 61/687,035--FIG. 9, Items 5, FIG. 10, Items 2, 20, and 21; and FIG. 16,
FIG. 17, Item 26; FIGS. 18-18c, Items 13-15, 18a-18c, 27, &amp; 28.
<br/><br/> As another example, a mobile user could activate all three systems (The Phone System, the Media/Internet System, and the Multi-cast System), expand the Multi-cast System, as shown in the drawings of The Provisional Patent Application
61/687,035--FIG. 17, Item 26 and FIG. 18-18c, Item 27; place a call to a friend by accessing a contact list from a social network application, (as shown in the drawings of The Provisional Patent Application 61/687,035--FIG. 18, Item 2), start a game (as
shown in the drawings of The Provisional Patent Application 61/687,035--FIG. 18, Item 14), LINK the friend to the game and play with or against the friend in real-time while being able to speak to, hear, and see the friend callee.  As shown in the
drawings of The Provisional Patent Application 61/687,035--FIGS. 18-19.  Each window opened in The Cascade Software.TM.  System has Ghosted Title Menu Bars.TM., which gives the user various options concerning the orientation of the window on the screen
(E.G. the window can be closed, minimized, staggered, or the window can display a series of iterative steps in time of how the window was configured or viewed so that the user can choose between the processes of opening or closing the window which
occurred in successive stages on the display GUI); as shown in the drawings of The Provisional Patent Application 61/687,035--FIGS. 11-12, Item 22; and FIGS. 18a, 18b, and 18c.
<br/><br/> Likewise two mobile users or groups of mobile users could be in different locations and SHOP and/or BID on a product together online with The Cascade Software System.TM.  by securely LINKING together their mobile phones/devices and surfing the
Internet for products to purchase; or by watching together and clicking on products for sale, or being auctioned and bided on in clickable video (a process coined by the Inventor as ClickVideoShopping.TM., a Trademark of Applicant, as defined by the U.S. Pat.  No. 7,162,696 B2).  The software allows mobile users to securely link their devices together using The Cascade Mobile Software System.TM.  so that the mobile phone/device has preset, but editable, user parameters used as preferred actions for the
system to perform when various commands are rendered.  For example, the mobile user can set the preferences of his/her mobile device to automatically search and display a merged directory of contacts that exist across various and distinctly separate
applications (APPS), like <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or Twitter, or he/she can set the preferences of his/her mobile device to automatically search, find, present, and display alternative vendors or stores (either from a preferred list of vendors or stores or in general)
where a product being searched or considered for purchase by the mobile smartphone/device user(s) is being sold for a cheaper price, or with other benefits or discounts to the shopper, or at a location closer to the mobile user(s), or more convenient to
the user(s) based on current traffic patterns.  The Cascade Software System.TM.  and Technology can map a route, display and/or speak the directions for the mobile user(s), based on real-time traffic patterns, to get to the desired location with the
desired product.  The Cascade Software System.TM.  and Technology Invention creates for the mobile user(s), intuitive applications (APPS) and what is coined by the Inventor as a Smart-Screen.TM.  (a Trademark of Applicant).  Mobile users could thread
applications (APPS) on their device together and send email or message communications across the entire thread or send the same message or email to a user in a particular application (APP) which is a part of a thread, based on the activity (logged-on) of
the desired recipient user within that threaded application (APP).  For example, if the mobile users are members of <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, and LinkedIn, popular applications (APPS), and the applications (APPS) are threaded together on both of their mobile
devices; mobile user 1 (one) could send a communication email, text, and/or message to mobile user 2 (two), even if mobile user 1 (one) was actively using <b><i>Facebook</i></b> and mobile user 2 (two) was actively using one of the other threaded applications (APPS),
like Twitter or LinkedIn.  See.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,162,696; Summary of the Invention, Column 3, lines 1-65; Detailed Description of the Invention, Column 5, lines 4-67, and Column 6, lines 1-67.
