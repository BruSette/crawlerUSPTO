       <p> A service provider receives from a user who has an account with it
     contact card information and recipient information picture information,
     therefrom determines a virtual contact card and contact channels through
     which the virtual contact card is sent to the recipients designated by
     the user, and sends the virtual contact card to the designated recipients
     through the contact channels. The virtual contact card and contact
     channels may be selected from what have been previously registered,
     either by the user or a third person, with the service provider and
     stored in the user's account, or just newly created, updated, and sent
     from the user at the time of transmission request to the designated
     recipients. The virtual contact card, when updated by the user, may be
     automatically sent by the service provider to the same recipients that
     previously received a pre-updated version.

<br/><br/> 1.  Field of the Invention
<br/><br/> The present invention generally relates to communicating and sharing information via virtual contact cards implemented by assistance of a payment provider.
<br/><br/> 2.  Related Art
<br/><br/> People in modern days are living with a flood of information.  In our daily lives, we constantly create, search for, receive, send, relay, review and evaluate information.  There are many occasions we wish to share, sometimes on a daily basis,
with others like friends, family members, customers or clients, or other groups with specific interests, particular information that we either created for commercial or personal purposes, received from other people, or found, for instance, on the
Internet.  If you are a merchant, for example, you may wish to frequently convey to your customers on a regular basis or update with them various information on your products, services, a new store opening, new location, hours, directions, or daily
specials or promotions, along with some multimedia files such as the pictures of sales items, or clips of advertisement.  If you are a member of book club, you may wish to share with other club members your new feelings, findings, or questions you had
while or after reading a particular book.
<br/><br/> Therefore, for situations when one needs to frequently or regularly send to other people, or update with them, specific information, there is a need to provide a means by which the newly created or updated information can be automatically
conveyed to the recipients desired by a sender or updated on the local copies on their personal devices so that the sender need not go through all the trouble of figuring out or searching for contact channels of recipients and then personally sending the
information to them whenever the sender newly creates or updates information. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES

account, according to one embodiment;
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a flowchart showing a process a service or payment provider performs in sending a virtual contact card to a recipient designated by a user, who has an account with the payment provider, according to one embodiment;
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is block diagram of a networked system suitable for implementing the process described herein according to one embodiment; and
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a computer system suitable for implementing one or more components in FIG. 3 according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows.  It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or
more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.
<br/><br/> A virtual contact card, described in the present disclosure, is a digital card, which may contain any information the creator desires to electronically convey to recipients.  For example, if the creator is a merchant, it may contain store
information such as store logos, marks, store hours, location, directions, maps, phone numbers, emails, web links, or contact channels for social network services such as Twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Skype, etc. The virtual contact card may also include
product/service information such as product/service catalogues, descriptions, prices, special promotions or sales information, coupons, QR codes, customers' feedbacks, evaluations or survey results, comparisons with competitors' products or services,
and/or the merchant's recommendations.  In one embodiment, the virtual contact cards may include website links directing the recipients to sites of merchants on their user devices, where more information on any related products or services from the same
merchants, or invitation to consumers to open an account with the merchants may be found.  In another embodiment, the contact cards may even include mobile APPs or html5 APPs, which would be automatically loaded and run on the user device of the
recipients.
<br/><br/> A virtual contact card may be comprised of texts, numbers, designs, pictures, photos, music files, moving clips, or any other multimedia features, which would be automatically displayed or played on the user device of the recipients via one or
more suitable client applications.  Further, the virtual contact card may have a tab or link on it to lead the recipient, when clicked on, to other content or information.  For instance, in a basic screen of a virtual contact card loaded on the
recipient's user device, there may be a tab or link named, for instance, `new store information` or `daily special.` This way of designing the contact cards with sub-menus would enable the creator to easily update only a relevant portion of a contact
card, for instance, the `daily special` section, without having to redesign the entire virtual card.  In this respect, the virtual contact cards may not necessarily consist of a single digital file, but may comprise multiple files, all of which may be
sent as a single virtual contact card.
<br/><br/> The virtual contact card may also be created and used, not only for a commercial purpose, but also for any personal purpose.  For instance, if people find places such as commercial or individual websites, personal blogs, or physical sites, which
they would like to introduce or recommend to their family or friends, virtual contact cards may be created containing all the desired information about the places.  Or, if one wishes to share one's daily comments, meditations, or summaries on news, stock
trends, religious devotions, recollections, book reviews, movie or music reviews, or whatever subjects and issues with a group of people having a common interest, virtual contact cards containing those daily inputs may be created and sent to that group.
<br/><br/> Once created, the virtual contact cards may be set up or registered by the creator with a service or payment provider, such as PayPal, Inc.  of San Jose, Calif., with whom the creator has an account.  The registration may be done by transmitting
the virtual contact cards to the service or payment provider from a user device, which may be a merchant's server, a PC, a mobile phone, a tablet, an iPad.TM., an iPod.TM., or any other suitable device that has a suitable client application developed
either by the service or payment provider or by a third party.  The service or payment provider may then store the registered contact cards in a memory of a server and associate them with the user's account of the registrant, along with other user
information needed for subsequent transmission to potential recipients designated by the creator/user.  Further, the virtual contact cards may be modified or updated whenever needed by the creator/user or any other rightful user through an access to the
user's account from a user device.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a flowchart showing a process 100 a user performs in setting up or updating virtual contact cards and contact information of potential recipients in an account with a service or payment provider, according to one embodiment.  The user
has an account with the service or payment provider such as PayPal, Inc.  of San Jose, Calif., and may be either a merchant such as a manufacturer, distributor, or retailor, who created or designed the virtual contact cards for commercial or business
purposes, or a consumer or any individual who designed the cards for various personal purposes.  Especially when the process 100 is practiced for updating/modifying a pre-existing virtual contact card, the user may be a recipient who received the virtual
contact card on her or his account from another user who may have created the card.
<br/><br/> At step 102, the user accesses an account with the service or payment provider from a user device, such as a merchant server, PC, tablet, or other suitable devices.  Accessing the account may include entering any requested identification and/or
authentication information, such as a user name, email address, name, phone number, password, PIN, pass code, etc., into a field via a device keyboard or keypad, or speaking an identifier into a device microphone.  Once the user has been authenticated,
the user may be directed to a home page of the payment provider or a user account.
<br/><br/> After authentication, the user may register, or update a virtual contact card(s) with the user's account at step 104.  On the home page, there may be options to register a new virtual contact card or modify a pre-registered virtual contact card. The options may be presented as a tab, button, or link on the screen of the user device, and the user may tap or click on them through a touch screen or mouse of the user device to initiate the registration or modification of the virtual contact card.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the virtual contact card may be created at a user device using any suitable local application, which might have been installed in the user device either by the payment provider or by a third party.  In an embodiment, tapping
or clicking on the tab, button, or link may pop up a window that may request the user to upload the virtual contact card that has been already created by browsing through the user device.  In another embodiment, the virtual contact card may be created,
at the time of registration, either locally via a user application or online via a server provided program loaded the user device, according to a pre-determined template or format.
<br/><br/> Similarly, when there is a need to update a pre-registered virtual contact card, a user tapping or clicking on a tab, button, or link may pop up the list of pre-registered virtual contact cards on the screen of the user device for the user to
choose from.  During editing/updating the selected card, again using a suitable local or online application, the user may import any files, such as pictures, music files, clips, or any alphanumeric texts into the virtual contact card being edited.  The
finished virtual contact card, which is to be registered with the server, may be in any publicly known format.
<br/><br/> Once having finished registering a virtual contact card, the user may be asked, at step 106, to enter information on potential recipients of the card.  On the page, there may be an option to create or modify/update a list of potential recipients
and register information for contacting them.  If the user selects this option, such as by tapping or clicking on a tab, button, or link on the user device through a touch screen or mouse, the user may be provided with fields and/or instructions to
enter/modify information about potential recipients.  Examples of requested information may include, but are not limited to, an identifier of each potential recipient, accounts of any social network services each potential recipient subscribes to, and
any restrictions that the payment provider should comply with in transmitting the particular contact card being registered to each potential recipient.  The identifier can be a name, an email address, a mobile phone number, or any other information that
identifies the potential recipient.  The type of identifiers may be specified by the payment provider in an embodiment.  The user may enter the identifiers in different ways, including through a user contact or address book on the user device, through a
user's social network, through manually entering the identifier onto a field via a device keyboard or keypad, or speaking the identifier into a device microphone.
<br/><br/> After entering an identifier(s) for a particular potential recipient, the user may be asked to enter or modify information on contact channels through which the payment provider may transmit the virtual contact card.  The contact channels may be
emails, any accounts of the potential recipient has with a service/payment provider, and/or accounts of social network services the potential recipient subscribes to.  Examples of the social network services include, but are not limited to, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b>
tweet (or Twitter), LinkedIn, Google+, or other SMSs (small message systems) or text-based systems.
<br/><br/> Further, at step 106, the user may be asked to add/modify any restrictions or options in transmitting, by the payment provider, the virtual contact card to a particular potential recipient.  For examples, the user may be asked to determine: when
the virtual contact card should be sent to the recipient(s), e.g., right after completing the registration process or any later time appointed by the user; whether the virtual contact should be automatically sent to the recipients, if it is modified or
updated, to the same recipients that the pre-updated version has been sent to or it should be sent only at the user's separate instruction; or how many different contact channels the contact card has to be sent to, if multiple contact channels have been
registered for a particular recipient, and if only one channel is to be used, what would be the preferred order, etc. The types of restrictions and options in a given potential recipient may be preset and provided by the program running on the user
device in one embodiment, or the user may create/add entirely new restrictions/options in another embodiment.
<br/><br/> At each step, the user can view the information entered or uploaded, and when no more information is to be added, the user is notified to confirm or modify, if desired, any information or uploaded material.  Note that one or more of the steps in
any process described herein can be combined with one or more steps, omitted, and/or performed in a different sequence.
<br/><br/> Once all the information about potential recipients for a particular virtual contact card is confirmed by the user, then at step 108, the user is given a choice to register/modify another virtual contact card.  If the user chooses to register
another card, the user may repeat the step 104.  If the user wishes to create a different list of potential recipients for the added virtual contact card, the user may repeat the step 106.  When the user finishes registering/updating all virtual contact
card(s) and all list(s) of potential recipients, the data may be stored in a memory of a server and associated or linked with the user account on the payment provider.  Moreover, the user may be asked whether the user wishes to send any of the
registered/updated virtual contact cards to selected recipients right away.  If the user wishes to do so, the user may have the payment provider transmit the selected virtual contact card(s) right away via the process 200 to be described with FIG. 2
herein.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a flowchart showing a process 200 a service or payment provider, such as PayPal, Inc.  of San Jose, Calif., performs, according to one embodiment, in sending a designated virtual contact card to a designated recipient at a user's
request, who has an account with the payment provider.
<br/><br/> At step 202, the payment provider receives from a user through a user device, contact card information and recipient information.  In the present disclosure, there are several different embodiments for implementing the process 200 depending on
whether the user who makes a transmission request by sending the contact card information and recipient information is a creator/registrant of the contact card, and whether the contact card information and recipient information utilizes a pre-registered
information.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the user may be the creator or designer of the virtual contact card, who could be either a merchant who designed the card for business purposes, or a consumer or individual who designed the card for personal purposes.  In
either case, at step 202, the user first accesses her or his account from a user device, such as via a user application installed therein.  The user device may be any device that has a capability of wireless communication with the payment provider via a
user application.  If the user is a merchant, the user device may be a merchant server or a PC.  If the user is a consumer or an individual, the user device could be a server, a PC, a mobile phone, a tablet, iPad.TM., iPod.TM., etc. The user application
on the user device may be developed either by the payment provider or by a third party.  Accessing the account may include entering any requested identification and/or authentication information into a filed provided by the user application as described
herein at the step 102 of the process 100.
<br/><br/> After authentication, the user sends, i.e., electronically transmits wiredly or wirelessly at step 202, contact card information to the payment provider via a suitable user application on the user device.  In one embodiment, there may be already
one or more virtual contact card(s) that have been pre-registered or previously updated with the service provider by the user, according to the process 100 described in FIG. 1.  The cards may have been already stored in a memory of the server of the
service provider and included in the user's account information.  First, there may be on the user application a tab or button saying, for instance, "My Contact Cards," and under it, another tab or button saying, "Send Contact Card" or "Share Contact
Card." If the user selects it, the user application may provide a button, tab, or link to open a list of the pre-registered virtual contact cards for the user to select.  When the user selects a particular contact card out of the list shown on the screen
on the user device by tapping or clicking on the button, tab, or link on the list, the user application may pop up another window asking whether the user wishes to transmit the selected contact card as it is, or update/edit it before transmission.  If
the user chooses, for example, `transmission as is,` the identifying information of the selected virtual contact card will be transmitted, at step 202, from the user device to the service provider as the contact card information.  If the user chooses to
edit/update the selected virtual contact card, the user application may load the selected virtual card on an editor program of the user device, either an editor integrated into the user application or an externally imported one, for the user to edit.  In
another embodiment, the user may be given an option to upload a ready-made virtual contact card from the user device to replace the selected existing contact card.  Upon completion of editing/updating the selected virtual contact card, the user
application may ask for confirmation on whether the user wishes to send the updated virtual contact card.  The user tapping or clicking on, for example, a `confirm` tab or button on the user application will send the entire contents of the newly and
locally updated virtual contact card to the service provider as the contact card information at step 202.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, when there is no pre-registered virtual contact card with the payment provider, the user may be provided, after user authentication, with an option to newly create or upload one or more virtual contact cards for immediate
transmission to the recipients designated by the user.  Then, the user may create or upload a new contact card, according to the process 100 described herein.  When the user confirms completion by tapping or clicking on, for example, a `confirm` tab or
button, the user application will send all information of the newly created virtual contact card, including its content, to the service provider as the contact card information at step 202.  The user may be further given an option to register the newly
created contact card with the service provider and have it associated with her or his account.
<br/><br/> In still another embodiment, the user need not be the designer or creator of a virtual contact card, but may be the one who received one in the past.  The virtual contact card may have been sent from a merchant, friend, family, or some other
person who created it to the account of the user with a service provider and saved in the user's account information.  At times, the user may wish to send the virtual contact card saved in her or his account to another person(s).  Then, the user may
perform the same step 202 to do that.  The user may access the account with the service provider from a user device, authenticate her or his account, load a list of virtual contact cards received and associated with the user's account, if there are
multiple ones, and select a desired virtual card out of the list to have it transmitted to a desired recipient(s).  The information of the selected virtual contact card, including the content, will be transmitted from the user device to the service
provider as the contact card information.
<br/><br/> After selecting a particular virtual contact card, at the same step 202, the user may be then asked to enter information on one or more recipients of the selected virtual card, recipient information.  In one embodiment, when the user is the
designer/registrant of the selected virtual contact card, the user may have already created and registered with the service provider one or more lists of potential recipients, in accordance with the process 100 described herein.  Each list may include
information on contact channels and/or any restrictions/options that the server should comply with in transmitting the particular registered contact card.  Such information may have been already associated with the user's account or included in the
user's account information.  The list may have been also updated by the user after initial registration with adding or dropping recipients, or changing the contact channels or restrictions in accordance with the process 100.  In this case, tapping or
clicking on a tab in the user application may open the list of potential recipients saved in the service provider on the user device for the user to select.  The user may be able to select one or more recipients, one by one, from the list by clicking on
the names on the list, and then the identifiers of the selected recipients may be transmitted from the user device to the service provider as the recipient information.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the user may not need to choose specific recipients one by one out of a list of potential recipients registered with the payment provider.  There may be a pre-determined list of recipients for a specific contact card and
the respective contact channels pre-registered with the payment provider.  This case may happen especially when the user updates a pre-registered contact card, which had been sent to a group of recipients at least once previously, and whose information
has been saved by the payment provider.  When the user confirms completion of updating one, the user may be given a choice between approving transmitting the updated contact card to the same group of recipients who received the pre-updated version, and
whose info nation had been stored with the payment provider, and editing the list of recipients before transmission.  In the user chooses the former, the user's tapping or clicking on, for instance, an `approval` tab or button would constitute sending
the payment provider recipient information that the recipients for the particular selected contact card are the same group of recipients who received the pre-updated version.
<br/><br/> In still another embodiment, when there is no pre-registered list of potential recipients with the service provider, the user may be provided with an option to create or upload a list of recipients for the selected contact card.  The user may be
asked to enter the name, contact channels in the preferred order, and any restrictions such as described herein, in a field provided by the user application.  All data entered by the user about the new recipients will be then transmitted to the payment
provider as the recipient information for the particular selected contact card.  This new data may be optionally registered with the payment provider, and associated with the user's account.
<br/><br/> Once the user selects the recipients to send the virtual contact card by the service provider, then at the same step 202, the user may be further asked by the user application to update or newly create, if desired, various restrictions on
transmitting the selected contact card, which may have been included in the user's account information.  The restrictions may include the user's choices on, for instance, whether the selected virtual contact card should be sent to the selected recipients
right away or at a later time to be decided by the user, or whether the selected contact card should be sent to all enlisted contact channels, or if not, what would be the preferred order of contact channels to transmit the selected card over in case the
most preferred one does not work.  Further, the restrictions may include the user's choice on whether the virtual contact should be automatically sent, if it is modified or updated, to the same recipients that the pre-updated version has been sent to, or
the updated version should be sent only at the user's separate instruction on that.
<br/><br/> If the user wishes to change any of the pre-registered restrictions, the user may follow the steps of the process 100 described herein.  For instance, if the user changes his pre-registered choice of `right away transmission` to `a later time
transmission,` the user may be asked to enter the desired date and time on a window popped up.
<br/><br/> Now at step 204, the payment provider determines, from the contact card information received from the user, a designated virtual contact card to transmit to the recipients designated by the user.  In one embodiment, the user selects, on the user
application on the user device, a specific virtual contact card from a list of pre-registered/updated contact cards, stored in the server of the payment provider.  Then, transmission of the selection to the payment provider constitutes transmission of
contact card information.  Upon receiving the contact card information that necessarily contains the identity of the selected card, the payment provider is able to readily determine the virtual contact card designated by the user for instant transmission
by searching among the pre-registered one or more virtual contact cards saved in its server.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the user may create/upload a new contact card or edit/update a pre-registered contact cards at the user device.  At completion, all information and contents of the newly created or updated virtual contact card are
transmitted to the payment provider as contact card information, upon which the payment provider can readily determine the virtual contact card designated by the user for instant transmission, and additionally, may save it in its server for further
transmissions in the future at the user's request.
<br/><br/> At step 206, the payment provider now determines, from the recipient information received from the user, one or more designated contact channels over which to send the designated virtual contact card.  In an embodiment where the user selects
specific recipients one by one out of a pre-registered list of potential recipients, the recipient information transmitted from the user device to the payment provider necessarily contains the identifiers of the selected recipient(s).  Upon receiving the
recipient information, the payment provider then is able to readily determine the designated contact channels to send the designated contact card by consulting the list of potential recipients and the contact channels for each potential recipient
included in the user's account information.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment where the user selects an entire group of recipients for sending the designated contact card to by selecting a preexisting list shown on the screen of the user device, which is usually the case when the user updates a
pre-registered contact card and chooses to send the updated contact card to the same group of people who previously received the pre-updated version, the recipient information the payment provider receives simply comprises the user's such decision to
utilize the pre-determined recipients and their respective contact channels.  Upon receipt of such recipient information, the payment provider can readily determine the designated contact channels by referring to the designated preexisting list of former
recipients and their contact channels stored in its server.
<br/><br/> In still another embodiment, when there is no pre-registered list of potential recipients with the service provider, and the user enters the name(s) of desired recipients and their contact channels in the preferred order on the user application,
all data entered by the user about the desired recipients is transmitted from the user to the payment provider as the recipient information.  The payment provider then can immediately determine the designated contact channels from the recipient
information it received, because the recipient information itself contains the information on contact channels to send the designated contact card.
<br/><br/> Finally at step 208, the payment provider sends, or electronically transmits, the designated virtual contact card to one or more recipients desired by the first user via the one or more designated contact channels that have been determined at
step 206.  The designated contact channels may be entails, accounts with a service/payment provider, and/or accounts of social network services the recipients subscribes to.  Examples of the social network services include, but are not limited to,
<b><i>Facebook,</i></b> tweet (or twitter), LinkedIn, Google+, or other SMSs (small message systems).
<br/><br/> If the designated virtual contact card is transmitted to the designated contact channels, it may be readily accessed and viewed by the recipients on their respective user devices.  In an embodiment, the virtual contact card may be edited and
stored by the recipients, and/or resent to another recipient.  Further, once a new virtual contact card is received or a previously received contact card is updated over the contact channels, the recipients may be immediately notified of its arrival or
update by, for instance, a window popped up on the user device, and be able to view it by simply clicking on a tab or link on the pop up window.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a networked system 300 configured to handle a process, such as described above, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.  System 300 includes first and second user devices 310 and 340 used by a first user
305 and a second user or a recipient 307, respectively, and a payment provider server 370 in communication over a network 360.  Payment provider server 370 may be maintained by a payment provider, such as PayPal, Inc.  of San Jose, Calif.  The users 305
and 307, such as buyers, consumers, or merchants, utilize user devices 310 and 340 to perform transactions relating transmission of a virtual contact card using payment provider server 370.  Note that transaction, as used herein, refers to any suitable
action performed using the user device, including transfer of information or file(s), display of information, or editing files, etc. Although only one recipient device 340 is shown, a plurality of recipient devices may be utilized if the first user is
transmitting a virtual card to multiple recipients.
<br/><br/> The first and second user devices 310, 340, and payment provider server 370 may each include one or more processors, memories, and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and/or data stored on one or more
computer readable mediums to implement the various applications, data, and steps described herein.  For example, such instructions may be stored in one or more computer readable media such as memories or data storage devices internal and/or external to
various components of system 300, and/or accessible over network 360.

<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a computer system 400 suitable for implementing one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.  In various implementations, the user device may comprise a personal computing device (e.g., smart phone, a computing
tablet, a personal computer, laptop, PDA, Bluetooth device, key FOB, badge, etc.) capable of communicating with the network.  The merchant and/or payment provider may utilize a network computing device (e.g., a network server) capable of communicating
with the network.  It should be appreciated that each of the devices utilized by users, merchants, and payment providers may be implemented as computer system 400 in a manner as follows.
<br/><br/> Computer system 400 includes a bus 402 or other communication mechanism for communicating information data, signals, and information between various components of computer system 400.  Components include an input/output (I/O) component 404 that
processes a user action, such as selecting keys from a keypad/keyboard, selecting one or more buttons or links, etc., and sends a corresponding signal to bus 402.  I/O component 404 may also include an output component, such as a display 411 and a cursor
control 613 (such as a keyboard, keypad, mouse, etc.).  An optional audio input/output component 405 may also be included to allow a user to use voice for inputting information by converting audio signals.  Audio I/O component 405 may allow the user to
hear audio.  A transceiver or network interface 406 transmits and receives signals between computer system 400 and other devices, such as another user device, a merchant server, or a payment provider server via network 360.  In one embodiment, the
transmission is wireless, although other transmission mediums and methods may also be suitable.  A processor 412, which can be a micro-controller, digital signal processor (DSP), or other processing component, processes these various signals, such as for
display on computer system 400 or transmission to other devices via a communication link 418.  Processor 412 may also control transmission of information, such as cookies or IP addresses, to other devices.
<br/><br/> Components of computer system 400 also include a system memory component 414 (e.g., RAM), a static storage component 416 (e.g., ROM), and/or a disk drive 417.  Computer system 400 performs specific operations by processor 412 and other
components by executing one or more sequences of instructions contained in system memory component 414.  Logic may be encoded in a computer readable medium, which may refer to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor 412 for
execution.  Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media.  In various implementations, non-volatile media includes optical or magnetic disks, volatile media includes dynamic
memory, such as system memory component 414, and transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire, and fiber optics, including wires that comprise bus 402.  In one embodiment, the logic is encoded in non-transitory computer readable medium.  In
one example, transmission media may take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio wave, optical, and infrared data communications.
<br/><br/> Some common forms of computer readable media includes, for example, floppy disk, flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with
patterns of holes, RAM, PROM, EEPROM, FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, or any other medium from which a computer is adapted to read.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments of the present disclosure, execution of instruction sequences to practice the present disclosure may be performed by computer system 400.  In various other embodiments of the present disclosure, a plurality of computer
systems 400 coupled by communication link 418 to the network (e.g., such as a LAN, WLAN, PTSN, and/or various other wired or wireless networks, including telecommunications, mobile, and cellular phone networks) may perform instruction sequences to
practice the present disclosure in coordination with one another.
<br/><br/> Where applicable, various embodiments provided by the present disclosure may be implemented using hardware, software, or combinations of hardware and software.  Also, where applicable, the various hardware components and/or software components
set forth herein may be combined into composite components comprising software, hardware, and/or both without departing from the spirit of the present disclosure.  Where applicable, the various hardware components and/or software components set forth
herein may be separated into sub-components comprising software, hardware, or both without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.  In addition, where applicable, it is contemplated that software components may be implemented as hardware
