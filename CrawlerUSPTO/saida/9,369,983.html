<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a mobile device includes a location sensor and an acceleration sensor.  The location and acceleration or speed of the mobile device are continuously tracked as it is carried by its user based on the location and
acceleration sensor readings.  Consequently, the location and acceleration or speed of the mobile device user may be inferred from the location and acceleration or speed information of the mobile device itself.  Such information may be analyzed to
extract statistical information that reflects the behavioral patterns of the mobile device user.  In particular embodiments, the location and acceleration or speed information of multiple mobile devices, belonging to multiple users, may be continuously
tracked and collected.  The information, once collected, may be aggregated and analyzed to extract statistical information that reflects the behavioral patterns of a group of mobile device users.
<br/><br/> Mobile devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated.  They are more powerful and support more functionalities.  For example, a smart mobile telephone is no longer limited to enabling its user to make telephone calls and text messages. 
Instead, the user can use the mobile telephone to, for example, take photographs, upload files, check stock prices, conduct banking transactions, surf the web, get driving directions, read electronic books, draft documents, and so on.  Often, mobile
devices include hardware and software components that help implement these functionalities.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a mobile device (e.g., a mobile telephone) includes a location sensor that is capable of determining its current location at a given time.  In some implementations, the location sensor may be a Global Positioning
System (GPS) sensor, which is capable of providing the GPS coordinates of its current location at a given time.  In particular embodiments, the mobile device further includes an acceleration sensor that is capable of determining its current acceleration
at a given time.  In some implementations, the acceleration sensor may be an accelerometer, which is capable of measuring its current acceleration at a given time.  The location sensor may be employed to determine the current location of the mobile
device at a given time, while the acceleration sensor may be employed to determine the current acceleration of the mobile device at a given time.  In addition, the current speed of the mobile device at a given time may be inferred based on the location
or acceleration sensor readings.  As an example, the locations of the mobile device may be tracked over a period of time based on the GPS coordinates provided by the location sensor.  This information, together with other optional sensor readings, may be
used to infer the speed of the mobile device moving around these locations during the period of time.  As another example, the accelerations of the mobile device may be tracked over a period of time based on the acceleration sensor readings.  The
acceleration data may be numerically integrated over time (i.e., adding them up over time) to infer the speed of the mobile device over the period of time.
<br/><br/> As the mobile device is carried by its user and thus moves with its user over time, the location of the mobile device may be continuously tracked based on the location sensor readings.  Optionally, the acceleration of the mobile device may be
continuously tracked as well based on the acceleration sensor readings.  In addition, the speed of the mobile device over time may be inferred from location or acceleration sensor readings.  In particular embodiments, the location and acceleration or
speed information of the mobile device may be continuously collected.  Since the mobile device is carried by and moves with its user, the location and acceleration or speed information of the mobile device user may be inferred from the location and
acceleration or speed information of the mobile device itself.  For example, as a user performs his daily activities (e.g., exercise, work, leisure, etc.) while carrying his mobile telephone with him, the location and acceleration sensors on the mobile
telephone may take readings periodically (e.g., once every few seconds or once every minute).  These sensor readings reflect the mobile telephone's and thus the user's location and acceleration or speed over time.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example method of continuously collecting location information from a mobile device and analyze the collected information to extract statistics that correlate to the behaviors of a user of the mobile device.  Suppose that a
mobile device 122 (e.g., a mobile telephone) is associated with a user 121.  Usually, as user 121 goes through his daily life, he carries mobile device 122 with him.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, mobile device 122 includes a location sensor.  Mobile device 122 continuously determines its current location as time passes (as illustrated in STEP 131).  In some implementations, there is a software application
residing on mobile device 122.  While this software application is running, it directs the location sensor to take readings periodically (e.g., once every few seconds or once every few minutes).  Alternatively, in some implementations, there may be a
software module included in the operating system of mobile device 122, which directs the location sensor to take readings periodically.  For example, each specific location may be represented as a set of GPS coordinates or a pair of latitude and
longitude.  Each location is also associated with a timestamp, which indicates when the location sensor reading is taken.  Thus, the readings show where mobile device 122 is at what time.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, mobile device 122 further includes an acceleration sensor.  Mobile device 122 may continuously determine its current acceleration as time passes as well.  Again, the software application or the software module in the
operating system of mobile device 122 may direct the acceleration sensor to take readings periodically.  For example, each specific acceleration reading may be represented as an acceleration value.  Each acceleration is also associated with a timestamp,
which indicates when the acceleration sensor reading is taken.  Thus, the readings show how fast mobile device 122 moves at what time.  In some implementations, the acceleration sensor and the location sensor are directed to take their respective
readings at about the same time, so that at a given time, the collected sensor data show where mobile device 122 is as well as how fast mobile device 122 moves.  The speed of the mobile device over time may be inferred from the location or sensor
readings.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, the software application or module automatically begins executing upon mobile device 122 being turned on and continues executing while mobile device 122 remains on.  Thus, as long as mobile device 122 is turned on, it
continuously collects its location and acceleration information.  However, to protect user privacy, in some implementations, user 121 is given the option of shutting down the software application or module whenever he desires, or preventing the software
application or module from starting automatically.  User 121 nevertheless has the option of starting the software application or module manually whenever he prefers.  This allows user 121 to control when his mobile device 122 should collect the
information and for how long.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the collected location and optionally, acceleration information is temporarily stored on mobile device 122 and uploaded to a server 112 for further processing and analysis as appropriate (as illustrated in STEP 132). 
In some implementations, the location and acceleration information is uploaded as soon as it becomes available (e.g., as soon as the sensors take their respective readings).  However, since in practice, the sensors may take their readings very frequently
(e.g., once every few seconds or minutes), this may result in high communication traffic and negatively affect mobile device's 122 performance.  In addition, mobile device 122 may not be connected to a network at all times.  Thus, in some
implementations, the information upload may be performed at appropriate intervals.  For example, the upload may be performed once an hour, or a upload is performed when a certain amount of data (e.g., 1 MB) has been accumulated.  If mobile device 122 is
disconnected from all networks for some period of time, a special upload may be performed when mobile device 122 is reconnected to a network to upload the data accumulated during that time period.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, server 112 may be associated with a social-networking system 111.  A social network, in general, is a social structure made up of entities, such as individuals or organizations, that are connected by one or more types
of interdependency or relationships, such as friendship, kinship, common interest, financial exchange, dislike, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge, or prestige.  In more recent years, social networks have taken advantage of the Internet.  There are
social-networking systems existing on the Internet in the form of social-networking websites.  Such social-networking websites enable their members, who are commonly referred to as website users, to perform various social activities.  For example, the
social-networking website operated by <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Inc.  at www.facebook.com enables its users to communicate with their friends via emails, instant messages, or blog postings, organize social events, share photos, receive news of their friends or
interesting events, play games, etc.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, user 121 may be a member of social-networking system 111, and thus has a user account with social-networking system 111.  User 121 may link mobile device 122 to his account with social-networking system 111 so that
server 112 is aware that mobile device 122 is associated with user 121.  In addition, in particular embodiments, mobile device 122 may be supplied or sponsored by social-networking system 111 and may include software applications specifically designed to
work with servers (e.g., server 112) associated with social-networking system 111.  For example, mobile device 122 may send its location and acceleration information as communication packets that each have a predetermined format so that server 112 can
interpret the data in the packets.  In addition, mobile device 122 may have been given the network destination of server 122 so that it knows where to send its location and acceleration information.  In particular embodiments, each packet may also
include a device identifier (ID) of mobile device 122 (e.g., its serial number) so that server 112 is able to determine which mobile device has sent a specific packet.  From this information, server 112 is able to determine to which user the location and
acceleration information in the packet relates (e.g., based on the information provided in the user accounts).  Alternatively, in particular embodiments, each packet may include the user ID of user 121 with social-networking system 111 so that server 112
is able to determine to which user the location and acceleration information in the packet relates.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, upon receiving the location and acceleration information from mobile device 122, server 112 stores the information, such as in a datastore (as illustrated in STEP 133).  In some implementations, the information is
stored in its raw form, such that there is an entry corresponding to each set of location and acceleration readings collected and sent by mobile device 122.  In other words, the information received from mobile device 122 is not aggregated.  The
following is an example of storing location and acceleration information in its raw form:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 location acceleration user ID timestamp (latitude, longitude) (m/s.sup.2) smith5928 2011-10-26 37.degree.  49', 8'' N 5 10:00:00 122.degree.  28' 41'' W smith5928 2011-10-26 37.degree.  49' 9'' N 3 10:05:00 122.degree.  29' 39'' W
smith5928 2011-10-26 37.degree.  49' 9'' N 0 10:10:00 122.degree.  29' 39'' W .  . . . . . . . . . . .
<br/><br/> In some implementations, upon receiving the location and acceleration information from mobile device 122, server 112 may infer the speed information of mobile device 122 from the received location or acceleration information.  In some cases,
instead of storing the acceleration readings received from mobile device 122, the inferred speed information about mobile device 122 is stored, in addition to the location readings.  In other cases, both the acceleration readings and the inferred speed
information about mobile device 122 are stored, again in addition to the location readings.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, server 112 may process and analyze the location and speed information collected and inferred over time to extract statistics that suggest behavioral patters of user 121 (as illustrated in STEP 134).  Different types of
statistics may be extracted and this disclosure contemplates any application type of statistics.  Social-networking system 111 may then use these statistics to serve its users, such as making recommendations.  In particular embodiments, the statistics
may be cached so that the information is more readily available.
<br/><br/> As an example, based on the location entries and their associated timestamps, server 112 may determine how much time user 121 spends at work each day.  Over time, the statistics may show how much time user 121 spends at work, either on average
or in total, during a day, a week, a month, or a year.  Similarly, if user 121 frequents a local restaurant, those location entries showing user 121 at the restaurant and their associated timestamps may show how much time user 121 spends at the
restaurant during a specific week, month, or year.  Thus, the statistics may show how much time user 121 spends at a specific place (e.g., work, home, restaurant, shop, etc.), either on average or in total, during a day, week, month, or year.
<br/><br/> As another example, the acceleration or speed entries and their associated timestamps may suggest how much time user 121 walks or runs each day.  A person usually walks at a speed between 3 to 4 miles per hour.  Thus, those speed entries showing
mobile device 122 moving at approximately such speed range may suggest that user 121 had been walking during the associated time periods.  Similarly, a person usually runs at a speed between 5 to 7 miles per hour.  Again, those speed entries showing
mobile device 122 moving at approximately such speed range may suggest that user 121 had been running during the associated time periods.  Over time, the statistics may show how much time user 121 spends exercising (e.g., walking or running), either on
average or in total, during a day, a week, a month, or a year.  Thus, the statistics may show how much time user 121 spends doing an activity, either on average or in total, during a day, week, month, or year.  For example, if the statistics indicate
that user 121 exercises less than 4 hours per week, social-networking system 111 may notify user 121 and recommend that user 121 should spend more time exercising.  Similarly, when mobile device 122 is stationary (e.g., the speed is 0) and the associated
timestamps indicate that it is at night, it may be inferred that user 121 is asleep.  Over time, the statistics may show how long, on average, user 121 sleeps each night.  For example, if the statistics indicate that user 121 usually sleeps less than 5
hours each night, social-networking system 111 may notify user 121 and recommend that user 121 should sleep more.
<br/><br/> As a third example, if someone else is looking for user 121, she may query server 112 for user's 121 last known location.  Server 112 may look up the last location entry received from mobile device 122 and its associated timestamp to determine
the last known location for user 121 and how recently user 121 had been at that location.  This may be useful when a parent wishes to know the last known location of her minor child (e.g., user 121).  In addition, the parent may track her minor child's
movements or whereabouts over time through location information received from a mobile device (e.g., mobile device 122) carried by her minor child.  This may be very valuable information to the parent, especially during an emergency.
<br/><br/> As a fourth example, suppose that user 121 lives and works in San Francisco.  However, during a two-week period, the location entries show that mobile device 122 is in New York City.  These entries may suggest that user 121 is traveling during
those two weeks.  Again, over time, the statistics may show how much time user 121 spends traveling and where user 121 travels to.
<br/><br/> Social-networking system 111 may have many users each having at least one mobile device.  In particular embodiments, each mobile device may continuously collect its own location and acceleration information and upload the information to server
112.  The speed information of the mobile device may then be inferred from the location or acceleration information.  Over time, server 112 may correlate the information about multiple users to exact statistics relating groups of users.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, for each user, his locations collected over time through an associated mobile device may be plotted against time.  FIG. 2 illustrates an example of plotting locations against time for two users, "X" and "Y".  Each point
along a curve is a specific location and its associated timestamp, as tracked by a corresponding mobile device associated with a corresponding user.  According to FIG. 2, the two curves, corresponding to users "X" and "Y" respectively, coincide at point
201.  This indicates that users "X" and "Y" had been at the same location at the same time corresponding to point 201.  Such curves may help track the movements or whereabouts of individual users over time and determine statistics for groups of users.
<br/><br/> As an example, if the location entries of multiple users indicate that many users spend time at a specific sports bar, this may suggest that this sports bar is popular among this group of users.  By examining the information provided in these
users' accounts with social-networking system 111, it may be determined that, for example, the sports bar is especially popular among those users between the ages of 25 and 30.  If there is another user who is 28 years old and lives nearby, but who has
never visited the sports bar, social-networking system 111 may suggest the sports bar to that user.  Similarly, the location entries of multiple users may help infer facts such as, popular vacation destinations that many users have visited or popular
activities that many users have participated.  Social-networking system 111 may suggest such information to other users.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 111 may categorize its users based on common user characteristics, such as age (e.g., users between the ages of 20 and 30), genders (e.g., male users vs.  female users), family status (e.g.,
single users, married users, divorced users, users with children), profession (e.g., engineers, accountants, doctors), geographical location (e.g., northern California, central California, southern California), and so on.  Statistics may be determined
for a particular category of users.  For example, for a group of female users between the ages of 30 and 40 who live in the San Francisco Bay Area, their corresponding location and acceleration or speed information may indicate which locations (e.g.,
restaurants, shops, clubs, parks) or which activities (e.g., hiking, cycling, shopping) are popular among this particular group of users.  These may be locations that a majority (e.g., more than 50% or 75%) of the users in the group have been to or
activities that a majority of the users in the group have participated in. Social-networking system 111 may make recommendations to other users sharing similar characteristics.
<br/><br/> As another example, suppose that given three users, "X", "Y", and "Z", their respective location entries have many matching points (e.g., they are often at the same location at the same time).  This may suggest that users "X", "Y", and "Z" know
each other well and often spend time together.  Moreover, if within social-networking system 111, users "X", "Y", and "Z" also have established "friend" connections with each other, it is a further indication that users "X", "Y", and "Z" probably are
good friends.  Based on such information, server 112 may determine that, for example, user "X" often socializes (e.g., hang out with) users "Y" and "Z".  Suppose that on a particular Saturday afternoon, users "Y" and "Z" are at a club frequented by users
"X", "Y" and "Z", social-networking system 111 may send to a notification to user "X" in case he wishes to join his friends at the club.
<br/><br/> As a third example, suppose that users "X" and "Y" have established "friend" connections with each other within social-networking system 111.  On a particular Saturday afternoon, users "X" and "Y" are at two different locations that are near
each other (e.g., within a few miles).  Social-networking system 111 may send notifications to users "X" and "Y" to let them know that their friend is nearby in case they wish to meet up (e.g., for coffee).
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the location and acceleration or speed entries of the users together may provide certain statistics as well.  As an example, the speed entries of a user may suggest that the user is running at certain times, while the
corresponding location entries of the user may indicate where the user is running Based on such entries of a group of users living in the same area (e.g., the San Francisco Bay Area), server 112 may determine where people living in that area like to go
running (e.g., the popular running places in the San Francisco Bay Area).  Suppose that a user has recently moved to the area and the user has indicated to social-networking system 111 that one of his hobbies is running, social-networking system 111 may
recommend the popular running places in the area to the user.
<br/><br/> As described above, server 112 stores the location and acceleration or speed information received from mobile devices associated with users in its raw form.  Since there may be millions of users each having hundreds of entries per day, the
amount of data can grow rapidly over time.  In addition, there is the concern with user privacy protection.  In particular embodiments, older data are transferred to another server 113 to be stored in aggregated form.  In some implementations, after the
data have been stored with server 112 in raw form for a time period (e.g., 3 to 5 years), the data are transferred to server 113, which may also be associated with social-networking system 111.  Server 113 aggregates the data and stores them in the
aggregated form (as illustrated in STEP 135).  Server 113 may filter the data as well so that only the more interesting data are stored.  Typically, people are more interested in and concerned with what they do or where they are in recent times instead
of what had taken place several years ago.  In particular embodiments, server 113 may extract features that describe users' behavioral patterns from the raw data and store these features (as illustrated in STEP 136).
<br/><br/> As an example, suppose that a user typically spends 9 hours per day and 5 days per week at work.  While the user is in his office working, his mobile device mostly remains at the same location (e.g., also in the user's office with the user, such
as sitting on top of the user's desk).  Nevertheless, the mobile device continuously takes location and acceleration sensor readings (e.g., once every 5 minutes) and sends the location and acceleration data to server 112.  During each 9-hour period that
the user spends at work, the sensor readings are approximately the same (e.g., approximately the same location and same acceleration) and yet, there may be 108 sets of data (e.g., timestamp, location, acceleration) collected and stored in raw form, which
are repetitive and do not provide additional information about the user.  Thus, server 113 may aggregate such data.  Instead of storing 108 sets of raw data for each 9-hour period, server 113 may store data describing the actual time the user spends at
work each day.  In this case, server 113 extracts the relevant features (e.g., the time the user spends at work each day) from the raw data and stores the features instead (e.g., storing the data in feature form).  Similarly, sever 113 may determine how
much time the user spends sleeping, exercising, and at leisure each day, how often the user visits a particular restaurant, how much time the user spends with his friends, and so on, and store these features that describe the user's behavioral patterns
instead of the raw data themselves.  Suppose that a user wishes to know whether he has improved his lifestyle and health by exercising more.  The user may query sever 113 for the amount of time he had spent exercising each week 3 years ago, and compare
it to the amount of time he spends exercising each week now.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, servers 112 and 113 may each be a unitary server or may be a distributed server spanning multiple computers or multiple datacenters.  Servers 112 and 113 may each include hardware, software, or embedded logic
components or a combination of two or more such components for carrying out the appropriate functionalities implemented or supported by servers 112 and 113, respectively.  For example, social-networking system 111, implementing a social-networking
website, may be hosted on servers 112 and 113.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may be implemented on one or more computer systems.  FIG. 3 illustrates an example computer system 300.  For example, servers 112 and 113 may each be implemented as computer system 300.  In particular embodiments, one or
more computer systems 300 perform one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein.  In particular embodiments, one or more computer systems 300 provide functionality described or illustrated herein.  In particular embodiments,

described or illustrated herein.  One or more computer systems 300 may perform at different times or at different locations one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein, where appropriate.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, computer system 300 includes a processor 302, memory 304, storage 306, an input/output (I/O) interface 308, a communication interface 310, and a bus 312.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates a particular
computer system having a particular number of particular components in a particular arrangement, this disclosure contemplates any suitable computer system having any suitable number of any suitable components in any suitable arrangement.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, processor 302 includes hardware for executing instructions, such as those making up a computer program.  As an example and not by way of limitation, to execute instructions, processor 302 may retrieve (or fetch) the
instructions from an internal register, an internal cache, memory 304, or storage 306; decode and execute them; and then write one or more results to an internal register, an internal cache, memory 304, or storage 306.  In particular embodiments,

and illustrates a particular processor, this disclosure contemplates any suitable processor.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, memory 304 includes main memory for storing instructions for processor 302 to execute or data for processor 302 to operate on.  As an example and not by way of limitation, computer system 300 may load instructions from
storage 306 or another source (such as, for example, another computer system 300) to memory 304.  Processor 302 may then load the instructions from memory 304 to an internal register or internal cache.  To execute the instructions, processor 302 may
retrieve the instructions from the internal register or internal cache and decode them.  During or after execution of the instructions, processor 302 may write one or more results (which may be intermediate or final results) to the internal register or
internal cache.  Processor 302 may then write one or more of those results to memory 304.  In particular embodiments, processor 302 executes only instructions in one or more internal registers or internal caches or in memory 304 (as opposed to storage
306 or elsewhere) and operates only on data in one or more internal registers or internal caches or in memory 304 (as opposed to storage 306 or elsewhere).  One or more memory buses (which may each include an address bus and a data bus) may couple
processor 302 to memory 304.  Bus 312 may include one or more memory buses, as described below.  In particular embodiments, one or more memory management units (MMUs) reside between processor 302 and memory 304 and facilitate accesses to memory 304
requested by processor 302.  In particular embodiments, memory 304 includes random access memory (RAM).  This RAM may be volatile memory, where appropriate.  Where appropriate, this RAM may be dynamic RAM (DRAM) or static RAM (SRAM).  Moreover, where
appropriate, this RAM may be single-ported or multi-ported RAM.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable RAM.  Memory 304 may include one or more memories 304, where appropriate.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular memory,
this disclosure contemplates any suitable memory.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, storage 306 includes mass storage for data or instructions.  As an example and not by way of limitation, storage 306 may include an HDD, a floppy disk drive, flash memory, an optical disc, a magneto-optical disc,
magnetic tape, or a Universal Serial Bus (USB) drive or a combination of two or more of these.  Storage 306 may include removable or non-removable (or fixed) media, where appropriate.  Storage 306 may be internal or external to computer system 300, where
appropriate.  In particular embodiments, storage 306 is non-volatile, solid-state memory.  In particular embodiments, storage 306 includes read-only memory (ROM).  Where appropriate, this ROM may be mask-programmed ROM, programmable ROM (PROM), erasable
PROM (EPROM), electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM), electrically alterable ROM (EAROM), or flash memory or a combination of two or more of these.  This disclosure contemplates mass storage 306 taking any suitable physical form.  Storage 306 may include
one or more storage control units facilitating communication between processor 302 and storage 306, where appropriate.  Where appropriate, storage 306 may include one or more storages 306.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular
storage, this disclosure contemplates any suitable storage.
