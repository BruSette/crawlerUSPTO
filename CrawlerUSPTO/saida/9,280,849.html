       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A system, method, and computer program product for automatically
     combining computer-generated imagery with real-world imagery in a
     portable electronic device by retrieving, manipulating, and sharing
     relevant stored videos, preferably in real time. A video is captured with
     a hand-held device and stored. Metadata including the camera's physical
     location and orientation is appended to a data stream, along with user
     input. The server analyzes the data stream and further annotates the
     metadata, producing a searchable library of videos and metadata. Later,
     when a camera user generates a new data stream, the linked server
     analyzes it, identifies relevant material from the library, retrieves the
     material and tagged information, adjusts it for proper orientation, then
     renders and superimposes it onto the current camera view so the user
     views an augmented reality.

<br/><br/> The present patent document relates in general to augmented reality systems, more specifically to relating stored images and videos to those currently obtained by an observer's portable electronic device.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> Modern portable electronic devices are becoming increasingly powerful and sophisticated.  Not only are devices running faster CPUs, they're also equipped with sensors that are making these devices more versatile than traditional personal
computers.  The use of GPS, gyroscopes, accelerometers have made these devices location aware, and opened up a world of possible applications that did not seem possible before.
<br/><br/> The standard definition of augmented reality is live direct or indirect viewing of a physical real-world environment whose elements are augmented by virtual computer-generated imagery.  Traditionally augmented reality applications have been
limited to expensive custom setups used in universities and academia, but with the advent of modem smartphones and powerful embedded processors, many of the algorithms that were once confined to the personal computer world are becoming a part of the
mobile world.  Layar and AroundMe are examples of two such applications that are increasingly popular and have been ported to many smartphones (Layar is a product of the company Layar, of the Netherlands, and AroundMe is a product of the company
Tweakersoft).  Both the Layar and AroundMe applications use location data obtained from GPS sensors to overlay additional information such as direction and distance of nearby landmarks.
<br/><br/> Typically, augmented reality implementations have relied on three elemental technologies:
<br/><br/> (1) Sensing technologies to identify locations or sites in real space using markers, image recognition algorithms, and sensors.
<br/><br/> (2) Information retrieval and overlay technologies to create virtual information and to overlay it on top of live images captured by the camera.
<br/><br/> (3) Display technologies capable of integrating real and virtual information which includes mobile phone display, projectors, as well as augmented reality glasses.
<br/><br/> In addition, mobile augmented reality techniques are roughly classified into two types based on the type of sensing technology used.
<br/><br/> A. Location Based Augmented Reality
<br/><br/> Location based augmented reality techniques determine the location or orientation of a device using GPS or other sensor, then overlay the camera display with information relevant to the place or direction.  The four common sensor platforms used
are described below: GPS: The Global Positioning System provides worldwide coverage and measures the user's 3D position, typically within 30 meters for regular GPS, and about 3 meters for differential GPS. It does not measure orientation.  One of the
major drawbacks of using GPS based systems is that they require direct line-of-sight views to the satellites and are commonly blocked in urban areas, canyons, etc. This limits their usability severely.  Inertial, geomagnetic, and dead reckoning: Inertial
sensors are sourceless and relatively immune to environmental disturbances.  Their main drawback however is that they accumulate drift over a period of time.  The key to using inertial sensors therefore lies in developing efficient filtering and
correction algorithm that can compensate for this drift error.  Active sources: For indoor virtual environments, a common approach is the use of active transmitters and receivers (using magnetic, optical, or ultrasonic technologies).  The obvious
disadvantage of these systems is that modifying the environment in this manner outdoors is usually not practical and restricts the user to the location of the active sources.  Passive optical: This method relies on using video or optical sensors to track
the sun, stars, or surrounding environment, to determine a frame of reference.  However most augmented reality applications refrain from using these algorithms since they are computationally intensive.
<br/><br/> B) Vision Based Augmented Reality
<br/><br/> Vision based augmented reality techniques attempt to model precise descriptions of the shape and location of the real objects in the environment using image processing techniques or predefined markers, and use the information obtained to align
the virtual graphical overlay.  These techniques may be subdivided into two main categories.  Marker Based Augmented Reality: Marker based augmented reality systems involve recognition of a particular marker called an augmented reality marker with a
camera, and then overlaying information on the display that matches the marker.  These markers are usually simple monochrome markers and may be detected fairly easily using less complex image processing algorithms.  Markerless augmented reality:
Markerless based augmented reality systems recognize a location or an object not by augmented reality markers but by image feature analysis, then combine information with the live image captured by the camera.  A well-known example of this image tracking
approach is Parallel Tracking and Mapping (PTAM) developed by Oxford University and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) which has been recently used by Nokia Research.
<br/><br/> Even though these techniques have been deployed and used extensively in the mobile space, there are still several technical challenges that need to be addressed for a robust, usable augmented reality system.
<br/><br/> There are three main challenges discussed hereafter:
<br/><br/> I. Existing Mobile Rendering APIs are Not Optimal
<br/><br/> Existing Mobile 3D solutions are cumbersome and impose limitations on seamless integration with live camera imagery.  For complete integration between live camera and overlaid information, the graphics overlay needs to be transformed and
rendered in real-time based on the user's position, orientation, and heading.  The accuracy of the rendering is important since augmented reality applications offer a rich user experience by precisely registering and orienting overlaid information with
elements in user's surroundings.  Precise overlay of graphical information over a camera image creates a more intuitive presentation.  User experience therefore degrades quickly when accuracy is lost.  There have been several implementations that have
achieved fast rendering by using OpenGL, or by remote rendering the information and streaming the video to mobile embedded devices.  Most modern smartphones have graphics libraries such as OpenGL that use the inbuilt GPU to offload the more
computationally expensive rendering operations so that other CPU intensive tasks such as the loading of points of interest are not blocked.  However the use of OpenGL on smartphone platforms introduces other challenges.  One of the biggest disadvantages
of using OpenGL is that once perspective-rendered content is displayed onscreen, it is hard to perform hit testing because OpenGL ES 1.1 does not provide APIs for "picking mode" or "selection" used to determine the geometry at particular screen
coordinates.  When controls are rendered in a perspective view, it is hard to determine whether touch events lie within the control bounds.  Therefore, even though OpenGL supports perspective 3D rendering under the processing constraints typical of modem
mobile smartphones, it is not optimal.
<br/><br/> II.  Real-Time Marker/Markerless Systems are Too Complex
<br/><br/> Real-time detection and registration of a frame reference is computationally expensive, especially for markerless techniques.  Mapping a virtual environment onto the real-world coordinate space requires complex algorithms.  To create a
compelling experience, the virtual viewport must update quickly to reflect changes in the camera's orientation, heading, and perspective as the user moves the camera.  This makes it essential to gather information about the device's physical position in
the environment in real-time.  Traditional techniques for frame of reference estimation depend on identifiable markers embedded in the environment or computationally-intensive image processing algorithms to extract registration features.  Most of these
image processing techniques need to be optimized extensively to fit within the hardware constraints imposed by mobile devices.  For closed environments where markers may be placed beforehand, the use of identifiable markers for detection and frame of
reference estimation is usually the best viable option.  This approach, however, is less suitable for augmented reality applications in outdoor environments since setting up the environment with markers prior to the application's use is unlikely. 
Attempts to perform real time natural feature detection and tracking on modem mobile devices have been largely intractable since they use large amounts of cached data and significant processing power.
<br/><br/> III.  Sensor Data for Location Based Systems is Inaccurate
<br/><br/> For location based augmented reality systems, especially GPS based systems, sensor noise makes orientation estimation difficult.  Modem mobile smartphones contain a number of sensors that are applicable for augmented reality applications.  For
example, cameras are ubiquitous and accelerometers and geomagnetic sensors are available in most smartphones.  Geomagnetic and gyroscope sensors provide information about users headings and angular rate which may be combined with GPS data to estimate
field of view and location.  However these sensors present unique problems, as they do not provide highly accurate readings and are sensitive to noise.  To map the virtual augmented reality environment into a real-world coordinate space, sensor data must
be accurate and free of noise that may cause jittering in rendered overlays.  The reduction of noise thus represents a significant challenge confronting augmented reality software.
<br/><br/> This patent application provides viable approaches to solve these challenges and present a practical implementation of those techniques on a mobile phone.  A new methodology for localizing, tagging, and viewing video augmented with existing
camera systems is presented.  A smartphone implementation is termed "Looking Glass".
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> A system, method, and computer program product for an augmented reality interface are disclosed and claimed herein.  Exemplary embodiments may comprise acquiring an image of a real-world scene and metadata with a camera, storing the image and
metadata, retrieving at least one stored image with metadata having selected features, manipulating the retrieved image, and combining the manipulated image with a currently observed real-world scene viewed with a portable electronic device.  The image
may include a still photograph, at least one video frame up to a full video.  The image may be in analog or digital format, and may be recorded or live.  The image may be communicated in a data stream.  The metadata may describe the physical location and
orientation of the camera during the acquiring, and may be provided by a GPS system, a gyroscope, and/or an accelerometer.  The metadata may be provided by the camera.
<br/><br/> The currently observed scene, images, and/or metadata may be stored on a server and/or the portable electronic device.  The selected features may include the stored physical location and orientation best matching a current physical location and
orientation of the portable electronic device.  Alternately, the selected features may include the stored physical location and orientation best matching at least one predicted physical location and orientation of the portable electronic device.  The
server may search for the selected features, and the retrieved image may be in a second data stream.  The portable electronic device may include a smartphone, a hand-held device, the camera, a second camera, a PDA, and/or a tablet computer.  The
embodiment may manipulate the retrieved image by adjusting image orientation.
<br/><br/> The embodiment may superimpose the manipulated image on the currently observed scene, which may involve merging the data stream with the second data stream.  The embodiment may combine manipulated imagery by displaying the manipulated image with
the portable electronic device in a display or a viewfinder.  The method preferably operates continuously and substantially in real time.  The method may operate as the currently observed scene changes as the portable electronic device is moved,

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> The challenges mentioned above are now addressed, and implementations of the present invention tackle each of the three challenges specifically.  Existing mobile rendering APIs are not optimal; they impose certain intractable limitations on the
interaction between the live and augmented view.  To mitigate these issues, the implementations of the present invention rely on simple scene graphs based on a nested view approach to render the content overlay.  Each view has a 4.times.4 visual
transformation matrix, which supports basic perspective rendering.  The transformation matrix is applied to graphics output when each view draws its respective content, and is also applied to user interaction events as they are passed into the view
stack.  The created transformation matrix approximates the perspective distortion caused by the camera movement, and applies the transformation to all views within the nested tree.  This enables easy rendering of interactive buttons on the screen, and
precludes the need to use other graphics libraries, such as OpenGL.  It also enables user interaction with rendered content, which is important for mobile augmented reality applications.  Most mobile APIs provide view/widget nesting mechanisms as well as
custom APIs for manipulating transform matrices.  This technique therefore provides the most flexibility for most augmented reality applications since at any given time there are not many transformations that need to be handled.  However, it must be
noted that as the complexity of the rendering increases, there will be a marked decrease in performance since all the transformations are being done in software.
<br/><br/> To test this approach, this nested view transformation was implemented on the iPhone 4 (iPhone is a registered trademark of Apple Computer, Inc.).  Tests showed that up to 23 different separate views may be shown on the screen without any
performance degradation.  As a result of this investigation, it was determined that most mobile APIs, such as those for Android (Android is a trademark of Google, Inc.) and more recently iPhone SDK 4.1, the video data may be exposed and nested in views
using the same technique.  This allows the implementation of an augmented reality application which not only augments the live camera imagery with graphics or text, but another live or recorded video.
<br/><br/> Another one of the challenges discussed earlier was the computational complexity involved in identifying frames of reference and correspondence.  This is one of the most crucial aspects of augmented reality technologies.  Using markers certainly
solves the frame of reference issue.  However, it is impractical for most mobile augmented reality applications since it requires customized markers to be placed.  Markerless approaches attempt to solve these issues by using CPU intensive image
recognition algorithms to identify features which may be used to determine a frame of reference, location and position of the virtual overlay with respect to the live camera image.  These techniques however, are impractical on most mobile devices since
they have limited CPUs.  On the other hand, using GPS sensors to locate position works for most cases and most modern smart phones are equipped with GPS as well as digital compass sensors.  The drawback of using these sensors is that they are susceptible
to noise and GPS sensors cannot be used indoors which severely limits their use for indoor applications.
<br/><br/> It is clear that none of the techniques on their own may be used to create a complete augmented reality system that works in all scenarios.  Therefore, these limitations were addressed by using a hybrid approach.  Embodiments of the present
invention use a combination of GPS sensor, digital compass, gyroscope information as well as a modified markerless feature tracking algorithm to achieve real time image registration and location estimation that may be used in any scenario.  These
techniques were implemented as an iPhone 4 application, since it provides the best combination of sensors that are required for this approach.
<br/><br/> The iPhone 4 contains AGD1 which is a 3 axis gyroscope/accelerometer as well as a magnetic sensor which provides directional information.  It also contains a GPS chip.  Recent studies using the iPhone 4 SDK have shown the background location
notification for the GPS has an accuracy of approximately 500 meters and an active accuracy of around 30 meters when there is a full signal lock.  This is a pretty large range, therefore to get a more refined and consistent location information, the
embodiments of the present invention combine the information from the digital compass as well as the gyroscope information to determine if a user was moving, and used the directional as well as the movement data to approximate location within a
500.times.500 meter grid.  The use of 3-axis gyros to determine location is not new and is used in most inertial navigation systems.  This technique is usually referred to as dead reckoning.
<br/><br/> Dead reckoning is the process of estimating present position by projecting heading and speed from a known past position.  The heading and speed are combined into a movement vector representing the change of position from a known position, P0, to
an estimated position, P1.  The accuracy of this estimation may be quoted as a confidence ellipse whose population mean is in the ellipse 95% of the time.  The axes of the ellipse are determined by the accuracies of the heading detection and speed
measurement.  This is illustrated in FIG. 1, which depicts a position confidence ellipse 100 using dead reckoning.
<br/><br/> A user moving from point P0 to point P1 may be described as being within the 95% confidence ellipse 100 centered on P1 with axes ab, determined by the heading sensor accuracy, and cd, determined by the speed sensor accuracy.  While the
uncertainty of a single reading may be described this way, the uncertainty of multiple readings is calculated as the cumulative sum of the uncertainty on all readings since the last precisely known position.  This is simply expressed in the equation
<br/><br/> .times..times..times.  ##EQU00001## where n is the number of dead reckoning calculations since P0, P.sub.n is the current position, and v.sub.e is the error vector for each calculation.
<br/><br/> Assuming a straight path, the resultant confidence ellipse after n iterations has axes of dimension n.times.ab and n.times.cd, or more simply, in the worst case these ellipses grow linearly with travel distance.  Clearly the accuracy of the
sensors is critical to the confidence that may be placed in position estimation using dead reckoning.  Unfortunately the sensors on most mobile smart phones are inaccurate and are severely impacted by noise.  As a result a number of noise filtering
algorithms were investigated, including Kalman filter based dead reckoning, and the Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter, however none of these seemed suitable for real time performance on mobile phone systems.  It was finally decided to implement a finite
impulse response filter, a method proposed by J. Benjamin Gotow et al. They recently proved that an adapted FIR filter may be used successfully on iPhone as well as Android phones with acceptable accuracy.  In addition, the more advanced Savitzky-Golay
smoothing filter may be applied offline by uploading the raw sensor data to a backend server which may run the data and then provide corrections to algorithm periodically.  FIG. 2 outlines the basic algorithm for filtering compass heading.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 shows the results of the filtering algorithm on raw sensor data within an iPhone implementation.  In this accelerometer filter implementation, different colors (not shown) may be used to represent accelerations in different orthogonal
axes.
<br/><br/> In the preferred embodiment, this technique allows users to record video and tag it with its current location.  This tag contains additional metadata that is uploaded to a server and is associated with video file.  The format of the metadata not
only contains longitude, latitude, and heading data but also grid coordinates that are calculated based on the location estimation obtained once the GPS coordinates match and the dead reckoning algorithm kicks in. This grid based approach to data storage
and point of interest retrieval has several benefits.  In areas where there are a large number of points of interest, such as cities, retrieving and caching a large number of geotagged points becomes difficult.  As the user moves, the system has to
continuously query its backend server to update the nearest points of interest.
<br/><br/> Unfortunately, there are several problems with this straightforward approach.  First of all, such a system is not scalable, as the number of users increase querying the database constantly severely degrades performance.  A different approach is
needed to avoid the execution of expensive database queries.  Requesting and retrieving data on a mobile smartphone is also problematic as continuous network connectivity quickly depletes the battery, and constantly uploading to and retrieving data from
servers may adversely affect the frame rate of the application.  One way to solve this issue is to cache the data based on approximate geolocations which are divided and stored as indexed grid coordinates in the database.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 depicts grid based location querying to retrieve and upload virtual content.  This grid based approach provides a scalable approach for information retrieval and caching for mobile devices.  It progressively loads contents from a server
based on GPS coordinates.  A hash function places each point denoted by its latitude/longitude and sub grid location based on accelerometer data into an indexed two-dimensional grid.
<br/><br/> Each longitude/latitude square in the grid contains all points within a specific geographical area, and may be loaded by querying the database for the indexed coordinate values.  Each square is further subdivided into the 50.times.50 grid, each
of which indexes a location roughly 10 square meters.  This grid is indexed based on approximate location within a single longitudinal/latitudinal grid which is based on information obtained from the filtering of the gyroscope data.  Indexing the
contents of the database using discretized latitude and longitude values obviates the need for numeric comparison and queries bounded by latitude and longitude values.  Queries may specify an exact block index and retrieve a group of points within a
predefined geographic area.
<br/><br/> There are several advantages of dividing content into a grid and retrieving it on block by block basis.  Information may be retrieved and cached using just indexes.  Each content item may be uniquely identified with 4 index numbers, two
specifying its longitude/latitude square and two specifying its sub-grid position.  This alleviates the need for complex retrieval queries on a central server.  Caching retrieved data is also straightforward since data may be stored and retrieved on the
device based on the block index.  Purging cached data based on its distance from the user's current location does not require iterating through each cached point.  Instead, entire blocks may be quickly deleted from the cache by using the discrete grid
indexes.  In addition, filtering blocks of points is much more efficient than processing each point and also requires constant evaluation time, regardless of the number of points present in the area.
<br/><br/> In addition to using accurate location information, embodiments of the present invention enhance the accuracy of the frame of reference by analyzing the individual camera frame for natural features.  There has been considerable research in
markerless augmented reality algorithms; techniques such as PTAM, SURF, and SIFT have all been proven to be efficient descriptors for augmented reality applications in mobile devices.  However all of these techniques are usually used on their own and
therefore are not suitable for hybrid techniques such as those needed for implementations of the present invention which needs to calculate and filter location data, as well as extract image features all at the same times without decreasing the real time
performance of the system.  Therefore a simpler image descriptor is required, which may be calculated efficiently on a mobile device.
<br/><br/> Recently, Edward Rosten et al presented a fast, efficient corner detection algorithm called FAST, which stands for Features from Accelerated Segment Test.  The feature detector considers pixels in a Bresenhams circle of radius r around the
candidate point.  If n contiguous pixels are all brighter than the nucleus by at least given threshold value t or all darker than the nucleus by given threshold value t, then the pixel under the nucleus is considered to be a feature.  Although r can in
principle take any value, only a value of 3 is used (corresponding to a circle of 16 pixels circumference), and tests show that the best value of n is 9.  This value of n is the lowest one at which edges are not detected.  The resulting detector produces
very stable features.  Additionally, FAST uses the ID3 algorithm to optimize the order in which pixels are tested, resulting in the most computationally efficient feature detector available.  ID3 stands for Iterative Dichotomiser 3, an algorithm used to
generate a heuristic decision tree.  It is an approximation algorithm that relies on Occam's razor rule to form the decision tree.
<br/><br/> The ID3 algorithm may be summarized as follows:
<br/><br/> 1.  Take all unused attributes and count their entropy concerning test samples
<br/><br/> 2.  Choose attributes for which entropy is minimum (or, equivalently, information gain is maximum)
<br/><br/> 3.  Make a node containing that attribute
<br/><br/> In embodiments of the present invention, uploaded video on the server is analyzed for corners features.  The entropy in this case is defined as the likelihood that the current pixel being analyzed is part of a corner.  This likelihood is
calculated based on the intensity of the current pixel with respect to its neighboring pixels.  Fast corner features are also extracted for each camera image at every frame and matched against those retrieved from the database.  A signed distance metric
is used to correct frame orientation and position to best align the virtual view with live camera imagery.
<br/><br/> The implementation of the hybrid augmented reality algorithm detailed in the previous section is now presented.  "Looking Glass" is an augmented reality based video tagging and sharing application.  As mentioned before, the choice of platform
was the iPhone 4, as it contained a 3 direction gyro and a stable SDK which made the implementation easier.  However it should be noted that these same techniques may be easily ported to Android or any other CE platform as well, as long as they have a
hardware profile similar to that of the iPhone 4G.
<br/><br/> The application may be divided into three distinct stages:
<br/><br/> In the first stage, the user may record and tag any video taken from an iPhone 4 with location, orientation and gyroscope data obtained from the GPS coordinates and the gyroscope filtering.  This additional information is stored in a special
binary file and associated with each video.  Users may record video within the application itself and tag it with description or comments.  When the user is finished, the application collates the location and gyroscope information along with the tag
information and sends it to the backend server.  FIGS. 5 and 6 depict a scene that a user wants to tag and upload to a server, and the iPhone application interface for recording, tagging, and uploading a video of the scene, respectively.  The user-tagged
videos may include annotations providing details on a given person, an object of interest, or a location being photographed.  These annotations may help a user share experiences and recommended locations to visit.  Multiple users may acquire and retrieve
videos with each other, such as friends or clients for example.
<br/><br/> In the second stage, the tagged videos are uploaded either during the next time the device is connected to a personal computer or when it connects to a Wifi network.  Both the video as well as the metadata file are sent to the server.  The
server annotates the metadata file with additional information that is obtained by analyzing the video frames.  Each video snippet may be sampled at 10 second intervals and from those samples FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) features are
obtained; these features may be used later to provide image registration information to assist overlay.  FIG. 7 depicts that metadata is uploaded from the phone to a server that contains both user video data as well as additional location metadata.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 depicts how a live camera image is augmented with user video, which may be either streamed or pre-downloaded.  The third stage of the methodology involves buffering the video snippets from the server to the user interface based on
location and orientation information.  Given the current location of the device, the server may determine the videos that will be within the device's view and preload the smaller video snippets.  As the user pans the camera thru the physical space, the
identified video snippets are overlaid in the location and direction at which they were originally tagged.  Once the user stops panning, the FAST corner features of the current frame are matched with the tagged video snippet and the video overlay is
adjusted to match the view and adjust that position of the overlay as the device moves in physical space.
<br/><br/> This patent application describes the various approaches by which augmented reality systems are implemented and a hybrid mechanism to build a viable, practical augmented reality system which can run efficiently on a modem high end mobile device. The challenges in implementing a robust, scalable system are identified, and applicable solutions to overcome those issues are presented.  The current work being done in hybrid techniques is extended by using a combination of markerless image processing
techniques and location based information.
<br/><br/> The techniques were tested by implementing a novel augmented reality application on the iPhone 4 which allows user to record, share and view user generated videos using an augmented reality interface.  The popularity of websites such as YouTube
and <b><i>Facebook</i></b> has made the creation and sharing of user generated videos mainstream.  However the viewing and sharing of these videos have still been limited to the grids and lists of the traditional personal computer user interface.  The "Looking Glass"
tool presents an interface where the physical world around us is tagged with videos and allows users to see it by just focusing on it.
<br/><br/> Further, the embodiments of the present invention enable the user to augment the physical real world environment with user generated videos.  The augmented reality interface described makes video available based on location, enabling sharing and
viewing videos across the physical space.  By implementing an efficient algorithm on a mobile device, such an application could easily be embedded not only on mobile phones but other CE devices such as still and video cameras, and tablet devices.  Such a
system may provide value added features along with the photos, videos, and even live streams that may be tagged.
