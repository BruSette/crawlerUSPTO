     computing device. The user interface feature is present independent of
     the operation of the plurality of applications. A change in the state of
     an application is detected and the appearance of the user interface
     feature is affected based on the design scheme associated with the
     application that is changed in state.

<br/><br/> Embodiments described herein include a system and method for operating a computing device and displaying a user interface feature on the display of the computing device.  More specifically, embodiments include automatically affecting the
appearance of a displayed user interface feature in response to a change in the state of an application.  In this way, the user interface feature may continuously change colors and/or appearance when a user access or operates a variety of different
applications.
<br/><br/> According to embodiments, a user may launch or open one or more applications that operate on a computing device.  Depending on the state of the one or more applications, the appearance of one or more user interface features may be altered or
modified.  The different states of the applications may correspond to whether the user has launched or opened the application, or is actively and currently using the application.  In some instances, the color or design of the user interface feature may
be automatically be changed to match a design scheme of an application that has a change in state.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, each of the plurality of applications that are installed or stored in the computing device is associated with a corresponding design scheme.  The plurality of applications may be provided with the computing device or be
provided by a third party developer and downloaded by a user (e.g., purchased from an application store).  Depending on the application, the design scheme may be selected by a user or by a third party developer of the application.  In some cases, an
application may have a default design scheme, but may be changed in response to a user input.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a user interface feature is displayed on the display of the computing device.  For example, according to some embodiments, the user interface feature may be a status or notification bar, or an application bar comprising a
plurality of application objects (e.g., a graphic image or icon representing an application).  The user interface feature is displayed independent of the operation of the plurality of applications.  For example, the user interface feature may be
displayed whether or not there are applications currently being used or accessed by a user.
<br/><br/> As discussed, in some embodiments, each of the applications are associated with a corresponding design scheme.  This includes applications that are created or designed by a third party developer.  The developer of the third party application is
enabled to also generate a design scheme (e.g., select the appearance) for the user interface feature.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, a change in the state of an application is detected.  The change in state may be caused by a user operating the computing device.  The user may alter the state of an application by (i) launching or opening the
application that is currently not being used, (ii) bringing the application that has been opened, but not being used, into focus, or (iii) actively using the application.  In other embodiments, some applications may change state upon an event occurrence
with relation to the application (e.g., upon receiving a new text message or email).
<br/><br/> In response to detecting the change in the state of an application, the appearance of the displayed user interface feature may be automatically altered or modified.  The appearance is affected based on the design scheme associated with the
application that has changed state.  For example, the appearance of the user interface feature may be changed to match or complement the design scheme of the application.
<br/><br/> In the various embodiments described, each of the plurality of applications are associated with a corresponding design scheme by assigning each of the applications to a particular pattern, shading, and/or color.  In other embodiments, each of
the applications may also be assigned a particular color or hue.

110 and the design table 140 and send application information 150 to the presentation component 130.  The presentation component 130 generates and displays one or more user interface features.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the plurality of applications 110 can include applications use for messaging (e.g., SMS, MMS, instant messages, or other types), web browsing, media playback, personal information management (e.g., such as contact records
management, calendar applications, tasks scheduling and lists), image or video/media capture, games, and other applications providing various other functionalities.  Other applications can include social networking applications (such as <b><i>FACEBOOK</i></b> or
TWITTER), banking or finance applications, newspaper applications, or e-book applications.  Users may download various additional applications from an application store and install them on their computing devices.  Depending on user input with respect to
the applications 110, each of the plurality of applications 110 can communicate their state information to the design management component 120.
<br/><br/> The design table 140 stores a table associating each of the applications 110 with a corresponding design scheme.  Whenever a user downloads a new application, the application is associated with a corresponding design scheme and this information
is stored in the design table 140.  Applications 110 originally provided by the computing device are each associated with a corresponding design scheme.  Similarly, according to an embodiment, third party developer-provided applications 110 also have a
corresponding design scheme selected and/or created by a third party designer or developer of the application 110.  An application's 110 design scheme can be found with meta-information associated with the application.  In some embodiments, an
application 110 may have multiple design schemes that may be selectable by a user.
<br/><br/> A design scheme of an application 110 includes various attributes that are seen by a user when the application 110 is launched or opened on the computing device.  In some embodiments, the design scheme of a particular application 110 includes
various characteristics of the application, such as colors, hues, shading, patterns, designs, and emblems, as well as font and text size, content, background, and borders of the application 110.  The design scheme and the overall appearance of an
application are pre-determined by the designer and/or creator of the application.  For example, when a messaging application is launched and displayed on the display of the computing device, the messaging application may have a border with a particular
color, e.g., blue.  In addition, the background of the application may be a different shade of blue or grey, for example, with a slight pattern of diagonal lines.  Each of the applications 110 has a corresponding design scheme that is associated with it
and stored in the design table 140.
<br/><br/> The system 100 also includes a presentation component 130.  The presentation component 130 is configured to generate one or more user interface features.  A user interface feature is provided on the display of the computing device to enable a
user to input selections and interact with the device.  The user interface features are presented on the display independent of the applications 110 that are stored or installed in the device.  In some embodiments, a user interface feature may be a
status or notification bar.  An example of a status bar is illustrated in FIGS. 4A-4C.
<br/><br/> The status bar (e.g., user interface feature) may be presented in different locations of the display of the computing device (e.g., at a top, bottom, left or right portion of the display).  According to an embodiment, the location of the status
bar may be affected by the orientation of the computing device.  Many devices can be operated in either a landscape or a portrait mode, depending on, for example, a manner in which a user holds the computing device.
<br/><br/> The status bar may provide a variety of information to a user.  In one or more embodiments, the status bar may include selectable icons or graphic images that represent time and date, network connectivity, power/battery life, or notifications
received from one or more applications 110.  A user may select various icons or graphic images to cause the computing device to display other windows and/or applications.  For example, when the user selects the network connectivity icon, a window may
appear showing what connections are active (e.g., Wi-Fi active or on, or Bluetooth active or on).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the status bar may also include a portion that displays text corresponding to the application that is currently being accessed or used by a user.  The text corresponding to the application may be selectable to access a menu
of the particular application.  On the other hand, if no application is currently being accessed or used, the portion may include text corresponding to an overall menu of the computing device.  If a user selects the menu, another window may appear and
provide a user with more options to interact with or access the mobile computing device.
<br/><br/> In other embodiments, a user interface feature may be an application bar.  An example of an application bar is illustrated in FIGS. 4A-4C.  The application bar provides a plurality of application objects (e.g., icons or graphic images that
correspond to the applications) that are selectable by a user.  A user may select an application object to open or launch the application.
<br/><br/> A user interface feature, such as a status bar or an application bar, may have a default appearance and/or color scheme.  The status bar may have a solid color or transparent/translucent, a shaded color, different colors, different patterns,
etc. In some embodiments, a user may set or choose the default appearance and/or color schemes of the user interface features.  For example, a user may have the option to select a theme or color theme for the computing device.  If the user selects an
ocean theme or blue color theme for his or her computing device, a variety of different user interface features may have colors and/or appearances that correlate or match the theme (e.g., the status bar may be light blue, while the background is a darker
blue with waves).
<br/><br/> In other embodiments, a developer for third party applications may be enabled to generate a design scheme (e.g., choose and set the appearance and/or color scheme) for the user interface features.  For example, a developer of a banking
application, which allows a user to access his or her banking accounts from the computing device, may be enabled to generate a design scheme for the status bar of the user's computing device.  Depending on the design scheme associated with the banking
application, the developer may generate a design scheme for the status bar so that the status bar matches or complements the design scheme of the banking application.
<br/><br/> The system 100 also includes a design management component 120 that communicates with a plurality of applications 110 and the design table 140.  The design management component 120 is configured to detect a change in a state of an application
110 and communicate application information 150 to the presentation component 130.  The applications 110 that are stored in the computing device may be in a variety of different states.  For example, an application may be (i) closed, (ii) opened or
launched and currently used or operated on by the user, or (iii) opened or launched, but not used or operated on by a user.  Other states are possible, such as an application being out of focus (e.g., partially hidden or partially minimized, for
example), or an application that is hidden from the display screen.  In some embodiments, the design management component 120 detects what state each application is in and detects if there is a change in one or more applications.
<br/><br/> Based on the change of the state of an application, the design management component 120 communicates application information 150 to the presentation component 130.  Application information 150 may include information corresponding to an
application whose state has changed and the state information of that application.  For example, a variety of applications may be stored in the computing device and each application may correspond to an application object (e.g., an icon).  A user may
launch or open an email application by selecting (through user input) the corresponding application object.  Upon launching or opening the email application, the design management component 120 detects that a change in the state of the email application
has occurred.
<br/><br/> Upon launching or opening the email application, the design management component 120 detects that the state of the email application has changed from a closed state to an opened or launched state.  The design management component 120 then
communicates application information 150 regarding the email application and the state of the email application to the presentation component 130.  The application information 150 also includes design scheme information corresponding to the email
application (received from the design table 140).  Depending on the state of the email application, the presentation component 130 affects the appearance of one or more displayed user interface features (e.g., a status bar) based on the design scheme
associated with the email application.
<br/><br/> Upon receiving application information 150 that the email application is being used by the user, the presentation component 130 affects the appearance of the user interface features.  In one embodiment, the appearance of the status bar is
modified or altered so that it matches or complements the design scheme of the email application.  For example, if the email application design scheme has a certain pattern or shading of light green around the borders and/or background of the
application, the presentation component 130 may change the appearance and/or the colors of the status bar so that it is a darker green to match or complement the email application design scheme.  In other embodiments, depending on the design scheme of an
application, the appearance of the user interface features may be altered to match or complement various characteristics of the application design scheme, such as colors, hues, shading, patterns, designs, and emblems, as well as font and text size,
content, background, and borders of the application.  The appearance of the status bar is altered in this manner to make the status bar aesthetically pleasing to the user.
<br/><br/> When the user closes the email application after using it, or brings the email application out of focus, for example, the design management component 120 detects that the state of the email application has changed again.  This information is
communicated to the presentation component 130 and the presentation component 130 again automatically alters the appearance of the displayed user interface features.  For example, in response to the email application being closed or being brought out of
focus, the status bar changes appearance from the dark green color to another color, such as the default colors and/or appearance of the status bar.
<br/><br/> Similarly, in some embodiments, if the user is accessing an email application and opens or launches another application (e.g., a calendar application), the email application is automatically brought out of focus.  The design management component
120 detects that the state of the email application has changed from being used by the user to being out of focus, and also detects that the calendar application has changed states from being closed to being opened/launched.  Application information 150
corresponding to the email application and calendar application (and their respective states) is communicated from the design management component 120 to the presentation component 130.  The presentation component 130 then alters the appearance and/or
colors of the status bar from the appearance it was in (e.g., from matching the email application design scheme) to matching the calendar application design scheme.  If the design scheme of the calendar application includes a border that is red in color
and textured, for example, the appearance of the status bar is changed to match or complement the red and textured design scheme of the calendar application.  Examples of the user interface features and applications are discussed with reference to FIGS.
4A-4C below.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates a method for operating a computing device under an embodiment.  A method such as described with FIG. 2 may be implemented using, for example, elements shown and described with FIG. 1.  As such, references to elements of FIG. 1
are intended to illustrate only suitable elements for performing a step or sub-step being described.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the flow chart 200 of FIG. 2 represents an exemplary method in which a user interface feature is displayed on a computing device and is then altered based on a design scheme associated with an application.  In step 205, each
of the applications that are stored or installed in the computing device is associated with a corresponding design scheme.  As discussed, in various embodiments, a design scheme of a particular application includes various characteristics, such as
colors, hues, shading, patterns, designs, and emblems, as well as font and text size, content, background, and borders of the application.  In some embodiments, a third party applications developer may be enabled to generate a design scheme for the user
interface features.
<br/><br/> At step 210, the presentation component 130 displays one or more user interface features on the display of the computing device.  The user interface features may be present independent of the operation of the plurality of applications stored in
the computing device.  A displayed user interface feature may be a status or notification bar, or an application bar.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment, the design management component 120 detects whether there is a change in a state of one or more applications (step 215).  If there is no change in the state of any application (e.g., none are opened from being closed,
none are closed from being opened, or none are minimized, etc.) the displayed user interface features are not altered.  However, as discussed, when a state of an application is changed from being closed (not opened) to being launched so that a user can
use the application, for example, the design management component 120 detects that a change has occurred.  Similarly, if the state of an application is changed from being accessed by a user to being closed, the design management component 120 detects
this change.  Once the design management component 120 detects a change, application information 150 corresponding to the applications are communicated to the presentation component 130 to affect the appearance of the displayed user interface feature
(step 220).
<br/><br/> As discussed, in some embodiments, a third party developer is enabled to generate a design scheme for a user interface feature.  If the application that has changed state is a third party developed application, and the third party developer
generated a design scheme for the status bar to match or complement the developed application, upon detecting the change in the state of the third party application, the appearance of the status bar is affected based on the design scheme generated by the
developer.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, if an application is opened or launched from an off or closed state, the appearance and/or colors of the displayed user interface feature is affected and modified to match or complement the design scheme of the launched
application (e.g., match a primary color scheme of the launched application, or match various other characteristics such as shading and hues).  In other embodiments, if an application is closed or minimized from an open state in which the user was
accessing the application, the appearance and/or colors of the displayed user interface feature is modified to return to a default appearance and/or colors.
<br/><br/> Hardware Diagram
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a computing device for implementing an architecture such as described with FIG. 1, under an embodiment.  In FIG. 3, a computing device 300 includes a processing resource 310, one or more memory 320 for storing
applications, display features, and data used by the applications (e.g., Flash memory, RAM, hard drive, portable storage units, etc.), a control console 330 for enabling a user to control the device 300 with user inputs, a radio and network resource 340,
and a display assembly 350.  In some embodiments, the control console 330 can be incorporated or be a part of the display assembly 350.
<br/><br/> The processing resource 310 is configured to execute instructions and process data for implementing the system 100 as described with FIG. 1, so that group notifications can be provided on the display assembly 350 of the computing device 300. 
The radio and network resource 340 enables network connectivity and/or cellular telephony capabilities.  The radio and network resource 340 can be configured to enable network connectivity or connectivity with other devices through use of the Wi-Fi
protocol (e.g., IEEE 802.11(b) or (g) standards), Bluetooth protocol, etc.
<br/><br/> In one or more embodiments, the display assembly 350 can include a touch screen display to enable a user to control the device 300 by making contact and movements on the touch screen display.  The user selections or inputs referred to in FIGS. 1
and 2 can be performed on a touch screen display.  Some user inputs can be a tap on a selectable feature or icon on the user interface, or other actions, such as a quick double tap or a gesture (e.g., a drag or swiping motion).  As discussed, in some
embodiments, a user may change a state of an application through user input.  For example, a user may open or launch an application by tapping on an application icon on the display.  The user may also make a swiping gesture to move from one opened
application to another (e.g., when the applications are not in focus).
<br/><br/> User Interface Features
<br/><br/> FIGS. 4A-4C illustrate notification bars provided on a display under an embodiment.  The illustrations described with FIGS. 4A-4C may be implemented using, for example, elements shown and described with FIGS. 1-3.  As such, reference to elements
of FIGS. 1-3 is intended for illustration purposes.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4A illustrates user interface features that are provided on a computing device under an embodiment.  Presentation 400 includes a status bar 410 and an application bar 420.  According to an embodiment, the status bar 410 and the application
bar 420 are both user interface features that are displayed on the display of a computing device.  As described in FIGS. 1-3, the appearance of the status bar 410 may be affected depending on a change of a state of an application.  In other embodiments,
the appearance of the application bar 420 may be automatically affected instead.  The status bar 410 includes a menu on the left portion and a plurality of selectable icons corresponding to different information relating to the computing device.  The
application bar 420 includes a plurality of different application objects that are selectable in order to launch or open one or more applications.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 4A, presentation 400 has no applications that are opened or launched, and no applications that are minimized or out of focus.  Because no applications have changed state, the appearance of the status bar 410 is not affected.  The colors
and the overall appearance of the status bar 410 may be the default colors and/or appearance set by a user or the developer or manufacturer of the computing device.
<br/><br/> If a user opens or launches an application, however, the change in the state of the application is detected.  In FIG. 4B, an application has been launched and opened, and is being accessed by a user.  This is represented by the application 420
being displayed in its full size, for example, on the display of the computing device.  Once the change in the state of the application 420 has been detected, the appearance of the status bar 410 is automatically affected.  The colors and/or the
appearance of the status bar 410 is changed or modified to resemble and/or match and/or complement the design scheme (e.g., the primary color scheme) of the application 420.  If the application 420 has a primary color scheme of orange, the status bar 410
may change its appearance to match the orange color scheme of the application 420.  In this way, the status bar 410 may be aesthetically pleasing and at the same time, efficiently enable a user to interact with and access the computing device (e.g.,
icons and menu are still selectable).
<br/><br/> In FIG. 4C, a presentation 400 is illustrated with three applications 420, 430 and 440 that are opened, but not being accessed or used by the user.  Instead, the three applications are all taken out of focus.  For example, in one embodiment, the
user may scroll through the out-of-focused applications (left to right, or right to left) to browse the various applications that are opened, but not being currently used.  When a user selects one of the applications to access (e.g., brings the
application to focus, or maximize the application), such as application 430, the change in the state of the selected application 430 is detected.  In response, the status bar 410 may after its colors and/or appearance based on the design scheme of the
selected application 430 (e.g., green from orange).
<br/><br/> While the examples provided with respect to FIGS. 4A-4C discuss the status bar 410 being changed in appearance, in some embodiments, the appearance of the status bar 410 and/or the application bar 420 are affected based on the design scheme of
an application whose state has changed.
<br/><br/>Alternate Embodiments
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, even if multiple applications are out of focus, the status bar 410 may change its appearance and/or colors depending on which out-of-focus application is currently centered in the display of the computing device (e.g., the
state of the out-of-focus application changes depending on the location relative to the center of the display).  For example, referring back to FIG. 4C, application 420 is centered, while applications 430, 440 are not.  Even though all three applications
420, 430, 440 are out of focus and not currently being used by the user, the appearance of the status bar 410 may be automatically affected to match the design scheme of the application 420.  If a user scrolled to the left to center the application 440
(e.g., by making a swiping gesture on a touch screen display), however, the status bar 410 can automatically change appearance to match or complement the design scheme of the application 440.
<br/><br/> As discussed, a user interface feature may be present independent of the operation of the plurality of applications.  However, in some embodiments, the status bar may be configured to be hidden or be covered when certain applications are being
used by a user.  For example, in certain gaming applications, the application, when being used, may span the entire display of the computing device so that the status bar or other user interface features are hidden.  The status bar or other features may
be shown if the user pauses out of the gaming application, or minimizes the gaming application (or makes the application out of focus--but not closed or shut down completely).  In this manner, the status bar may after its appearance in response to the
application changing state (e.g., user opening or starting or launching the application) and then may subsequently be hidden when the application changes state again (e.g., displayed application changes state to a larger size).
<br/><br/> It is contemplated for embodiments described herein to extend to individual elements and concepts described herein, independently of other concepts, ideas or system, as well as for embodiments to include combinations of elements recited anywhere
in this application.  Although embodiments are described in detail herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments.  As such, many modifications and variations will
be apparent to practitioners skilled in this art.  Accordingly, it is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the following claims and their equivalents.  Furthermore, it is contemplated that a particular feature described either
individually or as part of an embodiment can be combined with other individually described features, or parts of other embodiments, even if the other features and embodiments make no mentioned of the particular feature.  This, the absence of describing
combinations should not preclude the inventor from claiming rights to such combinations.
