       <p> In one embodiment, a method includes receiving from a server, by a mobile
     computing device, real-time activity stories for display by the mobile
     computing device. The real-time activity stories are sent automatically
     by the server to the mobile computing device while a user is interacting
     with the mobile computing device. The method also includes receiving from
     the server, by the mobile computing device, news-feed stories for display
     by the mobile computing device. The news-feed stories are sent by the
     server to the mobile computing device in response to requests from the
     mobile computing device for the news-feed stories. The method also
     includes displaying, by the mobile computing device, to the user the
     real-time activity stories and the news-feed stories in a scrollable
     visual stack.

create and store in the social-networking system a user profile associated with the user.  The user profile may include demographic information, communication-channel information, and information on personal interests of the user.  The social-networking
system may also, with input from a user, create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social-networking system, as well as provide services (e.g., wall posts, photo-sharing, event organization, messaging, games, or
advertisements) to facilitate social interaction between or among users.
<br/><br/> The social-networking system may send over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user.  A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of
the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social-networking system.  The social-networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user, such as a news feed of aggregated stories of
other users connected to the user.
<br/><br/> A mobile computing device--such as a smartphone, tablet computer, or laptop computer--may include functionality for determining its location, direction, or orientation, such as a GPS receiver, compass, or gyroscope.  Such a device may also
include functionality for wireless communication, such as BLUETOOTH communication, near-field communication (NFC), or infrared (IR) communication or communication with a wireless local area networks (WLANs) or cellular-telephone network.  Such a device
may also include one or more cameras, scanners, touchscreens, microphones, or speakers.  Mobile computing devices may also execute software applications, such as games, web browsers, or social-networking applications.  With social-networking
applications, users may connect, communicate, and share information with other users in their social networks.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a social-networking system may provide to a user a news feed including one or more news-feed stories.  Each news-feed story may include content related to a specific subject matter or topic.  In particular embodiments,
the social-networking system may aggregate information of user activities related to a specific subject matter into a news-feed story.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may provide to a user a stream of real-time activity stories.  The social-networking system may provide to the user a real-time activity story related to a particular activity, as the
particular activity happens.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a user's mobile computing device may send a request to the social-networking system, causing the social-networking system to send news-feed stories to the mobile computing device.  The social-networking system may also
send to the user's mobile computing device real-time activity stories, as the respective corresponding activities happen.  The mobile device may display to the user the real-time activity stories and the news-feed stories in a scrollable visual stack. 
The real-time activity stories and the news-feed storied in the scrollable visual stack may be ordered chronologically, with the most recent real-time activity story (or most recent news-feed story) placed on top of the scrollable visual stack.

MAN, a portion of the Internet, a portion of the PSTN, a cellular technology-based network, a satellite communications technology-based network, another link 150, or a combination of two or more such links 150.  Links 150 need not necessarily be the same
throughout network environment 100.  One or more first links 150 may differ in one or more respects from one or more second links 150.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, client system 130 may be an electronic device including hardware, software, or embedded logic components or a combination of two or more such components and capable of carrying out the appropriate functionalities
implemented or supported by client system 130.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a client system 130 may include a computer system such as a desktop computer, notebook or laptop computer, netbook, a tablet computer, e-book reader, GPS device,
camera, personal digital assistant (PDA), handheld electronic device, cellular telephone, smartphone, other suitable electronic device, or any suitable combination thereof.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable client systems 130.  A client system
130 may enable a network user at client system 130 to access network 110.  A client system 130 may enable its user to communicate with other users at other client systems 130.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, client system 130 may include a web browser 132, such as MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER, GOOGLE CHROME or MOZILLA FIREFOX, and may have one or more add-ons, plug-ins, or other extensions, such as TOOLBAR or YAHOO TOOLBAR. A user at client system 130 may enter a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or other address directing the web browser 132 to a particular server (such as server 162, or a server associated with a third-party system 170), and the web browser 132 may generate
a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request and communicate the HTTP request to a server.  The server may accept the HTTP request and communicate to client system 130 one or more Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) files responsive to the HTTP request. 
Client system 130 may render a webpage based on the HTML files from the server for presentation to the user.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable webpage files.  As an example and not by way of limitation, webpages may render from HTML files,
Extensible Hyper Text Markup Language (XHTML) files, or Extensible Markup Language (XML) files, according to particular needs.  Such pages may also execute scripts such as, for example and without limitation, those written in JAVASCRIPT, JAVA, MICROSOFT
SILVERLIGHT, combinations of markup language and scripts such as AJAX (Asynchronous JAVASCRIPT and XML), and the like.  Herein, reference to a webpage encompasses one or more corresponding webpage files (which a browser may use to render the webpage) and
vice versa, where appropriate.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may be a network-addressable computing system that can host an online social network.  Social-networking system 160 may generate, store, receive, and transmit social-networking data, such
as, for example, user-profile data, concept-profile data, social-graph information, or other suitable data related to the online social network.  Social-networking system 160 may be accessed by the other components of network environment 100 either
directly or via network 110.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may include one or more servers 162.  Each server 162 may be a unitary server or a distributed server spanning multiple computers or multiple datacenters.  Servers 162
may be of various types, such as, for example and without limitation, web server, news server, mail server, message server, advertising server, file server, application server, exchange server, database server, proxy server, another server suitable for
performing functions or processes described herein, or any combination thereof.  In particular embodiments, each server 162 may include hardware, software, or embedded logic components or a combination of two or more such components for carrying out the
appropriate functionalities implemented or supported by server 162.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 164 may include one or more data stores 164.  Data stores 164 may be used to store various types of information.  In particular
embodiments, the information stored in data stores 164 may be organized according to specific data structures.  In particular embodiments, each data store 164 may be a relational database.  Particular embodiments may provide interfaces that enable a
client system 130, a social-networking system 160, or a third-party system 170 to manage, retrieve, modify, add, or delete, the information stored in data store 164.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may store one or more social graphs in one or more data stores 164.  In particular embodiments, a social graph may include multiple nodes--which may include multiple user nodes (each
corresponding to a particular user) or multiple concept nodes (each corresponding to a particular concept)--and multiple edges connecting the nodes.  Social-networking system 160 may provide users of the online social network the ability to communicate
and interact with other users.  In particular embodiments, users may join the online social network via social-networking system 160 and then add connections (i.e., relationships) to a number of other users of social-networking system 160 whom they want
to be connected to.  Herein, the term "friend" may refer to any other user of social-networking system 160 with whom a user has formed a connection, association, or relationship via social-networking system 160.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may provide users with the ability to take actions on various types of items or objects, supported by social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, the items
and objects may include groups or social networks to which users of social-networking system 160 may belong, events or calendar entries in which a user might be interested, computer-based applications that a user may use, transactions that allow users to
buy or sell items via the service, interactions with advertisements that a user may perform, or other suitable items or objects.  A user may interact with anything that is capable of being represented in social-networking system 160 or by an external
system of third-party system 170, which is separate from social-networking system 160 and coupled to social-networking system 160 via a network 110.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may be capable of linking a variety of entities.  As an example and not by way of limitation, social-networking system 160 may enable users to interact with each other as well as receive
content from third-party systems 170 or other entities, or to allow users to interact with these entities through an application programming interfaces (API) or other communication channels.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a third-party system 170 may include one or more types of servers, one or more data stores, one or more interfaces, including but not limited to APIs, one or more web services, one or more content sources, one or more
networks, or any other suitable components, e.g., that servers may communicate with.  A third-party system 170 may be operated by a different entity from an entity operating social-networking system 160.  In particular embodiments, however,
social-networking system 160 and third-party systems 170 may operate in conjunction with each other to provide social-networking services to users of social-networking system 160 or third-party systems 170.  In this sense, social-networking system 160
may provide a platform, or backbone, which other systems, such as third-party systems 170, may use to provide social-networking services and functionality to users across the Internet.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a third-party system 170 may include a third-party content object provider.  A third-party content object provider may include one or more sources of content objects, which may be communicated to a client system 130. 
As an example and not by way of limitation, content objects may include information regarding things or activities of interest to the user, such as, for example, movie show times, movie reviews, restaurant reviews, restaurant menus, product information
and reviews, or other suitable information.  As another example and not by way of limitation, content objects may include incentive content objects, such as coupons, discount tickets, gift certificates, or other suitable incentive objects.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 also includes user-generated content objects, which may enhance a user's interactions with social-networking system 160.  User-generated content may include anything a user can add, upload,
send, or "post" to social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user communicates posts to social-networking system 160 from a client system 130.  Posts may include data such as status updates or other textual data,
location information, photos, videos, links, music or other similar data or media.  Content may also be added to social-networking system 160 by a third-party through a "communication channel," such as a news feed or stream.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may include a variety of servers, sub-systems, programs, modules, logs, and data stores.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may include one or more of the following: a
web server, action logger, API-request server, relevance-and-ranking engine, content-object classifier, notification controller, action log, third-party-content-object-exposure log, inference module, authorization/privacy server, search module,
ad-targeting module, user-interface module, user-profile store, connection store, third-party content store, or location store.  Social-networking system 160 may also include suitable components such as network interfaces, security mechanisms, load
balancers, failover servers, management-and-network operations consoles, other suitable components, or any suitable combination thereof.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may include one or more user-profile stores for storing user
profiles.  A user profile may include, for example, biographic information, demographic information, behavioral information, social information, or other types of descriptive information, such as work experience, educational history, hobbies or
preferences, interests, affinities, or location.  Interest information may include interests related to one or more categories.  Categories may be general or specific.  As an example and not by way of limitation, if a user "likes" an article about a
brand of shoes the category may be the brand, or the general category of "shoes" or "clothing." A connection store may be used for storing connection information about users.  The connection information may indicate users who have similar or common work
experience, group memberships, hobbies, educational history, or are in any way related or share common attributes.  The connection information may also include user-defined connections between different users and content (both internal and external).  A
web server may be used for linking social-networking system 160 to one or more client systems 130 or one or more third-party system 170 via network 110.  The web server may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing
messages between social-networking system 160 and one or more client systems 130.  An API-request server may allow a third-party system 170 to access information from social-networking system 160 by calling one or more APIs.  An action logger may be used
to receive communications from a web server about a user's actions on or off social-networking system 160.  In conjunction with the action log, a third-party-content-object log may be maintained of user exposures to third-party-content objects.  A
notification controller may provide information regarding content objects to a client system 130.  Information may be pushed to a client system 130 as notifications, or information may be pulled from client system 130 responsive to a request received
from client system 130.  Authorization servers may be used to enforce one or more privacy settings of the users of social-networking system 160.  A privacy setting of a user determines how particular information associated with a user can be shared.  The
authorization server may allow users to opt in or opt out of having their actions logged by social-networking system 160 or shared with other systems (e.g., third-party system 170), such as, for example, by setting appropriate privacy settings. 
Third-party-content-object stores may be used to store content objects received from third parties, such as a third-party system 170.  Location stores may be used for storing location information received from client systems 130 associated with users. 
Ad-pricing modules may combine social information, the current time, location information, or other suitable information to provide relevant advertisements, in the form of notifications, to a user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates example social graph 200.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may store one or more social graphs 200 in one or more data stores.  In particular embodiments, social graph 200 may include multiple
nodes--which may include multiple user nodes 202 or multiple concept nodes 204--and multiple edges 206 connecting the nodes.  Example social graph 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 is shown, for didactic purposes, in a two-dimensional visual map representation. 
In particular embodiments, a social-networking system 160, client system 130, or third-party system 170 may access social graph 200 and related social-graph information for suitable applications.  The nodes and edges of social graph 200 may be stored as
data objects, for example, in a data store (such as a social-graph database).  Such a data store may include one or more searchable or queryable indexes of nodes or edges of social graph 200.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may correspond to a user of social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third-party
application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over social-networking system 160.  In particular embodiments, when a user registers for an account with social-networking system 160, social-networking
system 160 may create a user node 202 corresponding to the user, and store the user node 202 in one or more data stores.  Users and user nodes 202 described herein may, where appropriate, refer to registered users and user nodes 202 associated with
registered users.  In addition or as an alternative, users and user nodes 202 described herein may, where appropriate, refer to users that have not registered with social-networking system 160.  In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may be
associated with information provided by a user or information gathered by various systems, including social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may provide his or her name, profile picture, contact information,
birth date, sex, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, or other demographic information.  In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to
information associated with a user.  In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may correspond to one or more web pages or one or more user-profile pages (which may be web pages).
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may correspond to a concept.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a concept may correspond to a place (such as, for example, a movie theater, restaurant, landmark, or city); a website (such
as, for example, a website associated with social-network system 160 or a third-party website associated with a web-application server); an entity (such as, for example, a person, business, group, sports team, or celebrity); a resource (such as, for
example, an audio file, video file, digital photo, text file, structured document, or application) which may be located within social-networking system 160 or on an external server, such as a web-application server; real or intellectual property (such
as, for example, a sculpture, painting, movie, game, song, idea, photograph, or written work); a game; an activity; an idea or theory; another suitable concept; or two or more such concepts.  A concept node 204 may be associated with information of a
concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems, including social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, information of a concept may include a name or a title; one or more images (e.g., an image of the
cover page of a book); a location (e.g., an address or a geographical location); a website (which may be associated with an URL); contact information (e.g., a phone number or an email address); other suitable concept information; or any suitable
combination of such information.  In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node 204.  In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may correspond
to a webpage.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a node in social graph 200 may represent or be represented by a webpage (which may be referred to as a "profile page").  Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social-networking system 160.  Profile pages may
also be hosted on third-party websites associated with a third-party server 170.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may
correspond to a particular concept node 204.  Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user node 202 may have a corresponding user-profile page in which the corresponding
user may add content, make declarations, or otherwise express himself or herself.  As another example and not by way of limitation, a concept node 204 may have a corresponding concept-profile page in which one or more users may add content, make
declarations, or express themselves, particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node 204.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may represent a third-party webpage or resource hosted by a third-party system 170.  The third-party webpage or resource may include, among other elements, content, a selectable or other icon, or
other inter-actable object (which may be implemented, for example, in JavaScript, AJAX, or PHP codes) representing an action or activity.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a third-party webpage may include a selectable icon such as "like,"
"check in," "eat," "recommend," or another suitable action or activity.  A user viewing the third-party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons (e.g., "eat"), causing a client system 130 to transmit to social-networking system 160 a
message indicating the user's action.  In response to the message, social-networking system 160 may create an edge (e.g., an "eat" edge) between a user node 202 corresponding to the user and a concept node 204 corresponding to the third-party webpage or
resource and store edge 206 in one or more data stores.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a pair of nodes in social graph 200 may be connected to each other by one or more edges 206.  An edge 206 connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes.  In particular embodiments,
an edge 206 may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a first user may indicate that a second user is a "friend" of the first
user.  In response to this indication, social-networking system 160 may transmit a "friend request" to the second user.  If the second user confirms the "friend request," social-networking system 160 may create an edge 206 connecting the first user's
user node 202 to the second user's user node 202 in social graph 200 and store edge 206 as social-graph information in one or more of data stores 24.  In the example of FIG. 2, social graph 200 includes an edge 206 indicating a friend relation between
user nodes 202 of user "A" and user "B" and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes 202 of user "C" and user "B." Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges 206 with particular attributes connecting particular user
nodes 202, this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges 206 with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes 202.  As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge 206 may represent a friendship, family relationship, business or employment
relationship, fan relationship, follower relationship, visitor relationship, subscriber relationship, superior/subordinate relationship, reciprocal relationship, non-reciprocal relationship, another suitable type of relationship, or two or more such
relationships.  Moreover, although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected, this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected.  Herein, references to users or concepts being connected may, where appropriate, refer
to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph 200 by one or more edges 206.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, an edge 206 between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node 202 toward a concept associated with a concept node 204.  As an
example and not by way of limitation, as illustrated in FIG. 2, a user may "like," "attended," "played," "listened," "cooked," "worked at," or "watched" a concept, each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype.  A concept-profile page
corresponding to a concept node 204 may include, for example, a selectable "check in" icon (such as, for example, a clickable "check in" icon) or a selectable "add to favorites" icon.  Similarly, after a user clicks these icons, social-networking system
160 may create a "favorite" edge or a "check in" edge in response to a user's action corresponding to a respective action.  As another example and not by way of limitation, a user (user "C") may listen to a particular song ("Ramble On") using a
particular application (SPOTIFY, which is an online music application).  In this case, social-networking system 160 may create a "listened" edge 206 and a "used" edge (as illustrated in FIG. 2) between user nodes 202 corresponding to the user and concept
nodes 204 corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application.  Moreover, social-networking system 160 may create a "played" edge 206 (as illustrated in FIG. 2) between concept nodes 204
corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application.  In this case, "played" edge 206 corresponds to an action performed by an external application (SPOTIFY) on an external audio
file (the song "Imagine").  Although this disclosure describes particular edges 206 with particular attributes connecting user nodes 202 and concept nodes 204, this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges 206 with any suitable attributes connecting
user nodes 202 and concept nodes 204.  Moreover, although this disclosure describes edges between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 representing a single relationship, this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node 202 and a concept node 204
representing one or more relationships.  As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge 206 may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept.  Alternatively, another edge 206 may represent each type of relationship (or
multiples of a single relationship) between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 (as illustrated in FIG. 2 between user node 202 for user "E" and concept node 204 for "SPOTIFY").
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may create an edge 206 between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 in social graph 200.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user viewing a concept-profile page (such as, for
example, by using a web browser or a special-purpose application hosted by the user's client system 130) may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node 204 by clicking or selecting a "Like" icon, which may cause the user's
client system 130 to transmit to social-networking system 160 a message indicating the user's liking of the concept associated with the concept-profile page.  In response to the message, social-networking system 160 may create an edge 206 between user
node 202 associated with the user and concept node 204, as illustrated by "like" edge 206 between the user and concept node 204.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may store an edge 206 in one or more data stores.  In particular
embodiments, an edge 206 may be automatically formed by social-networking system 160 in response to a particular user action.  As an example and not by way of limitation, if a first user uploads a picture, watches a movie, or listens to a song, an edge
206 may be formed between user node 202 corresponding to the first user and concept nodes 204 corresponding to those concepts.  Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges 206 in particular manners, this disclosure contemplates forming
any suitable edges 206 in any suitable manner.
<br/><br/> In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the social graph from one node to the other.  A degree of separation between two nodes can be considered a measure of
relatedness between the users or the concepts represented by the two nodes in the social graph.
<br/><br/> As described earlier, each time a user performs an activity or action (e.g., "like") on an item or object supported by a social-networking system or a third-party system, the social-networking system may record the action.  For example the
social-networking system may automatically create in a social graph an edge (e.g., an "like" edge) between a user node corresponding to the user and a node corresponding to the item or object, and store the edge in a data store.  Therefore, the
social-networking system may record many actions performed by different users of the social-networking system at different times.
<br/><br/> The social-networking system may provide to a user frequently update content based on recorded activities or actions that may be related to the user.  In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may support a news-feed service.  In
particular embodiments, a news feed may comprise a data format including one or more news-feed stories.  Each news-feed story may include content related to a specific subject matter or topic.  In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may
aggregate activities or actions related to a specific user action into a news-feed story.  For example, a first user may post a photo to the social-networking system, while other users of the social-networking system may perform various activities or
actions related to the photo.  Other users may "like" the photo, post comments related to the photo, or tag one or more particular users to the photo.  The social-networking system may aggregate activities related to the photo into a news-feed story
comprising an image of the photo, a profile picture of the first user, a count of "likes" of the photo by other users, and one or more comments related to the photo.  As for another example, a first user may checks in to a webpage (maintained by the
social-networking system or a third-party system) corresponding to a place (e.g., a landmark, a restaurant, a department store).  Other users of the social-networking system may "like" the check-in activity, or post comments related to the check-in
activity.  The social-networking system may aggregate activities related to the check-in activity into a news-feed story comprising a link and an image of the webpage, a profile picture of the first user, a count of "likes" of the check-in activity by
other users, and one or more comments related to the check-in activity.  The social-networking system may also aggregate into the news-feed story update to the webpage, or advertising related to the webpage (e.g., on-line coupons from a business related
to the webpage).  In particular embodiments, the social-networking may present a news feed including one or more news-feed stories to a viewing user.  For example, an application (e.g., a web browser) hosted by a client device of the viewing user may
retrieve a news feed from the social-networking system and display the news feed in the application's user interface.  The application may display each news-feed story in the news feed in a respective frame (e.g., an HTML iFrame) in the application's
user interface.
<br/><br/> The social-networking system may aggregate activities or actions into news-feed stories based on social-graph information.  For example, the social-networking system may aggregate for a viewing user a news feed including news-feed stories
related to activities or actions performed by users who are within a specified degree of separation (e.g., within two degrees of separation) from the viewing user on the social graph.  The social-networking system may aggregate activities or actions into
news-feed stories based on privacy settings.  For example, a user may specify which other users can access information of a particular activity performed by the user.  The social-networking system may aggregate for a viewing user a news feed including
news-feed stories related to activities accessible to the viewing user.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may provide to a user a stream of real-time activity stories (a real-time activity story "ticker").  That is, the social-networking system may provide to the user a story related to a
particular activity as the particular activity happens.  For example, a first user may perform an activity or action (e.g., post, "like", "check in", or comment).  In response to the activity performed by the first user, the social-networking system may
create a real-time activity story comprising one or more objects related to the activity (e.g., an image of a photo posted by the first user, a profile picture of the first user, a comment made by the first user, and so on), and present the real-time
activity story to a viewing user.  For example, the social-networking system may transmit the real-time activity story to a client device of the viewing user, causing the client device to display the real-time activity story in a user interface of an
application (e.g., a web browser) hosted by the client device.  The real-time activity story may be displayed in a frame (e.g., an HTML iFrame) within the user interface.  The social-networking system may create and present to a viewing user a real-time
story based on social-graph information.  For example, the social-networking system may create and present to a viewing user a real-time story of an action performed by a first user if the first user is within a specified degree of separation (e.g.,
within one degree of separation) from the viewing user.  The social-networking system may create and present to a viewing user a real-time story related to an action performed by a first user based on privacy settings (e.g., set by the first user).
<br/><br/> As described above, a news-feed story (of a news feed) may comprise aggregated and often time-elapsed information related to an activity or action.  Meanwhile a real-time activity story stream or ticker may comprise real-time activity stories,
each real-time story relating to an activity just happened.  An application hosted by a computing device may display a news feed and a real-time activity ticker in separate user interfaces (e.g., in separate columns of an HTML page).  However, it may not
be desirable to display a news feed and a real-time activity ticker in separate user interfaces for a mobile computing device due to its limited display size.  Particular embodiments describe methods of displaying news-feed stories and real-time activity
stories in a single user interface.  More particularly, the single user interface may comprise a scrollable visual stack of real-time activity stories and news-feed stories.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an example method 300 for displaying real-time activity stories and news-feed stories in a single user interface.  The example method 300 may be implemented by a mobile computing device of a user of the social-networking
system.  For example, the example method may be implemented by an application (or a process of an application) hosted by one or more processors of the mobile computing device.  The example method 300 may begin at step 310.  In particular embodiments, at
step 310, the mobile computing device may receive from a server (e.g., a server 162 illustrated in FIG. 1) one or more real-time activity stories for display by the mobile computing device.  In particular embodiments, the server may automatically
transmit (push) the real-time activity stories to the mobile computing device while the user of the mobile computing device is interacting with the mobile computing device.  The mobile computing device may determine that the user is interacting with the
mobile computing device if the user launches a particular application (e.g., a web browser, or a special-purpose client application) to interact with the social-networking system.  The mobile computing device may transmit a message to the server to
register a service with the server, causing the server to automatically transmit one or more real-time activity stories to the mobile device.  The mobile computing device may periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes) determine if the user is interacting with
a user interface of the particular application (e.g., by monitoring the user's input to the user interface, or by monitoring whether the user interface is at the foreground of the mobile device's display).  If the user is interacting with the user
interface, the mobile computing device may transmit a message to the server, causing the server to keep the service alive.  If the user is not interacting with the user interface, or the user has closed the particular application, the mobile computing
device may transmit a message to the server, causing the server to terminate the service for transmitting real-time activity stories to the mobile device.  The server may also terminate the service for transmitting real-time activity stories to the
mobile device if the server does not receive a message (to keep the service alive) from the mobile computing device for over a specified time (e.g., over 5 minutes).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the server may automatically transmit to the mobile computing device one or more real-time activity stories based on a power state of the mobile computing device.  For example, if the mobile computing device's battery is
less than a specified level of capacity (e.g., less than 15 percent of full capacity), the mobile computing device may transmit a message to the server to terminate the service for transmitting real-time activity stories to the mobile computing device in
order to extend battery life.  In other embodiments, the server may automatically transmit to the mobile computing device one or more real-time activity stories based on a network state of the mobile computing device.  For example, the mobile computing
device may transmit a message to the server to start the service for transmitting real-time activity stories to the mobile computing device only if the mobile computing device has a high-bandwidth network connection (e.g., Wi-Fi wireless connection).
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, at step 320, the mobile device may receive from the server one or more news-feed stories for display by the mobile computing device.  In particular embodiments, the server may transmit the news-feed stories to the
mobile computing device in response to requests from the mobile computing device for the news-feed stories.  The mobile computing device may periodically retrieve (pull) news-feed stories from the server.  For example, the user may launch a particular
application to interact the social-networking system.  The mobile computing device may then periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes) transmit a request (e.g., through an API) to the server, causing the server to transmit the news-feed stories to the mobile
computing device.  The user may also instruct the particular application (e.g., by selecting a refresh icon in the application's user interface) to transmit a request to the server, causing the server to transmit the news-feed stories to the mobile
computing device.  In particular embodiments, the mobile computing device may store (cache) a local copy of the news-feed stories at the mobile computing device (e.g., storing the news-feed stories in a local storage of the mobile computing device).  The
mobile computing device may transmit a request to the server, causing the server to transmit to the mobile computing device updates to the locally cached news-feed stories, and additionally new news-feed stories.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the mobile computing device may transmit to the server a request for news-feed stories based on a power state of the mobile computing device.  For example, if the mobile computing device's battery is less than a specified
level of capacity (e.g., less than 15 percent of full capacity), the mobile computing device may prolong the period of time between two requests for news-feed stories, or transmit to the server a request for news-feed stories only in response to the
user's request.  In other embodiments, the mobile computing device may transmit to the server a request for news-feed stories based on a network state of the mobile computing device.  For example, if the mobile computing device has a low-bandwidth
network connection (e.g., 2G cellular connection), the mobile computing device may transmit to the server a request for news-feed stories only in response to the user's request.
<br/><br/> For didactic purposes, FIG. 4 illustrates example interactions between the mobile computing device and the server of the social-networking system.  As described earlier, as the user of the mobile computing device turns on a particular
application to interact with the social-networking system (410), the mobile computing device may transmit a message to the server, causing the server to turn on a service for transmitting real-time activity stories.  When a user activity 422 happens
(e.g., a comment, a check-in, or a "like" by another user), the server may immediately transmit a corresponding real-time activity story to the mobile computing device (as denoted by the "RT" arrows illustrated in FIG. 4).  The mobile device may
determine that the user is active (420), and transmit a message to the server to keep the service for transmitting real-time activity stories alive.  Meanwhile, for every specified period or time or in response to the user's request, the mobile computing
device may transmit a request for news-feed stories to the server (430), causing the server to transmit news-feed stories to the mobile computing device (as denoted by the "NF" arrows illustrated in FIG. 4).
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 4, after the user turns off the particular application (420), the server may turn off the service for transmitting real-time activity stories (414) as the server has not received a keep-alive message for over a specified
period of time.  The server may not transmit a real-time activity story in response to a user action 425 (by another user), as the service for transmitting real-time activity stories is not active (e.g., the user is not interacting with the mobile
computing device).
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, at step 330, the mobile computing device may display to the user the real-time activity stories and the news-feed stories in a scrollable visual stack of real-time activity stories and news-feed stories.  In particular
embodiments, the real-time activity stories and the news-feed stories may be ordered based in recency in the scrollable visual stack.  In particular embodiments, the scrollable visual stack may comprise one or more frames, each frame displaying no more
than a specified number of the real-time activity stories.  FIGS. 5A-5D illustrates an example scrollable visual stack 500.  The mobile computing device may display in its display all or a portion of the scrollable visual stack 500.  The user of the
mobile computing device may scroll up or down the scrollable visual stack 500 by using any suitable input methods (e.g., a swipe touch gesture performed on the mobile computing device's touch display).  For example, the mobile computing device may
display the scrollable visual stack 500 in chronological order with the most recent news-feed story 510 (or real-time activity story 520) at the top of the scrollable visual stack 500.  As illustrated in FIG. 5A, the scrollable visual stack 500 may
comprise a frame 530 (a "ticker box") that displays no more than three real-time activity stories (520a, 520b, and 520c).  The frame 530 may further comprise a selectable icon 525 that indicates additional one or more real-time activity stories.  For
example, the user may select the selectable icon 525, causing the mobile computing device to display real-time activity stories 520d and 520e, in addition to the real-time activity stories 520a, 520b, and 520c, as illustrated in FIG. 5B.
<br/><br/> As described earlier, the server may transmit one or more real-time activity stories to the mobile computing device as the corresponding activities happen.  The mobile computing may also retrieve one or more news-feed stories from the server by
transmitting a request to the server, causing the server to transmit the news-feed stories to the mobile computing device.  The mobile computing device may display most recently received real-time activity stories (or most recently retrieved news-feed
stories) at the top of the scrollable visual stack.  For example, the mobile computing device may display most recently received real-time activity stories 520g and 520h at the top of the scrollable visual stack 500, as illustrated in FIG. 5C. 
Additionally, in particular embodiments, the mobile computing device may collapse a plurality of adjacently displayed real-time activity stories in a frame within the scrollable visual stack.  That is, if there are more than the specified number (e.g.,
three) of real-time activity stories adjacently displayed in the scrollable visual stack, the mobile computing device may collapse them into a frame (a "ticker box") of real-time activity stories.  For example, the mobile computing device may collapse
real-time activity stories 520g, 520h, and 520i in a frame 535, as illustrated in FIG. 5D.  Similarly to the frame 530, the frame 535 may display no more than a specified number (e.g., three) of real-time activity stories.  The frame 535 may also display
a selectable icon 540 that indicates additionally available real-time activity stories.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the mobile computing device may remove one or more real-time activity stories from the scrollable visual stack 500, if the one or more real-time activity stories are related a news-feed story displayed in the
scrollable visual stack 500.  For example, the mobile computing device may receive from the social-networking system a particular real-time activity story about a user posting a photo to the social-networking system, and display the particular real-time
activity story in the scrollable visual stack 500.  The mobile computing device may retrieve from the social-networking system, at a later time, a news-feed story aggregating activities related to the photo (e.g., a count of "likes" of the photo by other
users, comments related to the photo, as described earlier).  The news-feed story may also comprise an identifier of the particular real-time activity story (that is related to the news-feed story).  The mobile computing device may display the news-feed
story at the top of scrollable visual stack 500, while removing the particular real-time activity story (based on its identifier) from the scrollable visual stack 500.  The mobile computing device may also remove from the scrollable visual stack 500
other real-time activity stories that are related to the real-time activity story (e.g., a real-time activity story about another user's comment on the photo).
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may repeat one or more steps of the method of FIG. 3, where appropriate.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of FIG. 3 as occurring in a particular order, this disclosure
contemplates any suitable steps of the method of FIG. 3 occurring in any suitable order.  Moreover, although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components, devices, or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of FIG. 3, this
disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components, devices, or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of FIG. 3.
