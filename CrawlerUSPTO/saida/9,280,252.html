       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> An insurance application operating at a mobile computing device may
     request a set of recommended insurance tasks for a recommendation engine.
     The request may identify a user associated with the insurance
     application, and the recommendation engine may associate the user with a
     user group based on user profile attributes associated with the user. The
     recommendation engine may determine which tasks available for selection
     at the insurance application to include in the set of recommended
     insurance tasks based on selection trend data associated with the user
     group. The recommendation engine may provide the set of recommended
     insurance tasks to the insurance application, and the insurance
     application may configure an insurance task list that includes insurance
     tasks of the set of recommended insurance tasks.

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> The present invention generally relates to applications for managing insurance information and relates in particular to approaches for presenting insurance tasks at a user interface display of an insurance application on a mobile device.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> The proliferation of mobile computing devices has increased the potential to place knowledge and functionality at the fingertips of users.  As a result, the mobile application industry continues to grow at a rapid pace.  One industry that has
seen an increase in the use of mobile technology is the insurance industry.  Applications designed to operate at mobile computing devices, e.g., mobile cellular telephones and smartphones, have streamlined some of the interactions between insurance
providers and insurance customers.  Such applications enable insurance customers to carry out various insurance-related activities at their mobile computing devices.
<br/><br/> With respect to these mobile applications, there remains room for improvement.  Due to the broad number of insurance topics and activities associated with purchasing, maintaining, and utilizing insurance, customers--in particular new or
inexperienced insurance customers--may find the subject of insurance to be relatively complex.  Additionally, the size of the displays at mobile computing devices may limit or constrain the design of user interfaces for insurance applications. 
Therefore, given the large amount of potential insurance-related activities and insurance-related topics, there exists a need for improved approaches to presenting this functionality and information at an insurance application on a mobile computing
device.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> In light of the foregoing background, the following presents a simplified summary of the present disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention.  This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. 
It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention.  The following summary merely presents some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description
provided below.
<br/><br/> An insurance application operating at a mobile computing device may operate at the direction of a user utilizing the insurance application.  The insurance application may request a set of recommended insurance tasks for a recommendation engine. 
The request may identify a user associated with the insurance application, and the recommendation engine may associate the user with a user group based on user profile attributes associated with the user.  The recommendation engine may determine one or
more tasks available for selection at the insurance application to include in the set of recommended insurance tasks based on selection trend data associated with the user group.  The recommendation engine may provide the set of recommended insurance
tasks to the insurance application, and the insurance application may configure an insurance task list that includes insurance tasks of the set of recommended insurance tasks.  The set of recommended insurance tasks may be a set of recommended insurance
questions.
<br/><br/> The recommendation engine may obtain a relevancy score for the insurance tasks available at the insurance application and determine whether to include the insurance tasks in the set of recommended insurance tasks based on the respective
relevancy scores.  Relevancy scores may be respectively associated with user groups or individual user attributes.  The recommendation engine may also aggregate relevancy scores to obtain an aggregated relevancy score and determine whether to include an
insurance task in the set of recommended insurance tasks based on the aggregated relevancy score.  User attributes may also be respectively associated with weight values such that an aggregated relevancy score is also based on the weight values
associated with the user attributes.  The recommendation engine may include an insurance task in the set of recommended insurance tasks when an associated relevancy score meets or exceeds a relevancy threshold.  The recommendation engine may also exclude
an insurance task from the set of recommended insurance tasks when an associated relevancy score is less than the threshold.  A relevancy score may correspond to the number of times the insurance task is selected by users of the user group divided by the
number of times the insurance task is displayed to the user group.  Relevancy scores may be further based on selection frequency data associated with the user.
<br/><br/> When the user selects one of the insurance tasks at the insurance application, a selection message may be provided that identifies the selected insurance task.  The relevancy score may be increased in response to receipt of the selection message
indicating that the user selected the insurance task.  The selection message may also identify insurance tasks that were displayed to the user but not selected by the user.  The relevancy score for insurance tasks that were not selected by the user may
be decreased in response to receipt of the selection message.  The selection message may also indicate that the insurance task selected by the user was not included in the set of recommended insurance tasks.
<br/><br/> When an insurance event occurs, an insurance task configured for responding to the insurance event may be included in the set of recommended insurance tasks and suggested to the user.  Notification may be provided indicating that the insurance
event occurred, and the insurance task may be suggested to the user.  The user may also be prompted to accept or reject the insurance task suggested for responding to the insurance event, and a selection message may be provided indicating whether the
user accepted or rejected the suggestion.  Insurance events may include the start of an insurance payment period, the filing of a new insurance claim associated with the user, an update to an existing claim associated with the user, and a determination
of asset loss.
<br/><br/> A data store may be configured to store user profile data and selection trend data, a user interface at the insurance application may be configured to display the insurance task list, and a display manager may be configured to configure the
insurance task list.  Additionally, a processer may be configured to execute computer-readable instructions stored on a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium that are directed towards carrying out the steps set forth above. <br/><br/>BRIEF

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Aspects of this disclosure are directed towards assisting a user carry out an insurance transaction at an insurance application operating at a mobile computing device.  More particularly, aspects of this disclosure are directed towards
determining which insurance tasks available for selection at an insurance application are relevant to a user and configuring a list of insurance tasks presented to the user based, at least in part, on user profile data for the user.  In particular,
selections made by multiple users of respective insurance applications are monitored such that those selections may be leveraged when determining which insurance-related tasks may be relevant to a user.  A user may be categorized as belonging to a
particular user group, and the selections made by other users assigned to that group may be used to recommend insurance-related tasks to the user.  Automatically configuring the list of insurance tasks may include, for example, selecting which insurance
tasks to include in the list and, additionally or alternatively, arranging the insurance tasks included in the list based on relevancy to the user.  Configuring the list of insurance tasks may also include changing the prominence of insurance tasks
(e.g., via highlight, font size, and other text styling) as well as explicitly suggesting one insurance task to the user and prompting the user to accept or reject the suggestion.  As discussed in more detail below, the occurrence of an insurance event
may trigger the insurance task suggestion.
<br/><br/> An insurance task as used in this description refers to a process or functional workflow the user may initiate and carry out via the insurance application operating on the mobile computing device.  As discussed further below, the insurance
application may present the available insurance tasks in a user interface display.  The user interface display that includes the list of available insurance tasks may also include user interface elements for receiving user input to initiate the insurance
task or carry out the insurance task once initiated.  The insurance tasks included in the insurance task list may not include all of the insurance tasks potentially available for selection at the insurance application.  In other words, the insurance
tasks included in the list of insurance tasks may be a subset of the set of insurance tasks available for selection at the insurance application.  Examples of insurance tasks that may include, for example: initiating a conversation with an insurance
agent; reporting an accident; submitting an insurance payment; retrieving insurance portfolio information; requesting a quote for an insurance policy; retrieving insurance policy information; asking an insurance-related question; selecting an insurance
task option; and other insurance-related tasks.  It will be appreciated that additional or alternative insurance tasks may be available at example embodiments of the insurance application.  It will also be appreciated that, while the disclosures are
discussed within the context of a mobile application operating at a mobile computing device, aspects of the disclosure may also be employed at a web application configured to operate at a web interface via the Internet or at a standalone desktop
application configured to operate at a personal computer.
<br/><br/> As insurance tasks may refer to the submission of an insurance question or the selection of an insurance task option, it will also be appreciated that the list of insurance tasks may, in some example embodiments, be a list of insurance questions
or a list of insurance task options associated with an insurance task selected by the user.  Accordingly, aspects of this disclosure may be employed to determine which insurance questions or insurance task options are relevant to a user and automatically
configure a list of insurance questions or insurance task options determined to be relevant to the user.  Configuring the list of insurance questions or insurance task options may likewise include selecting which insurance questions or insurance task
options to include in the list and, additionally or alternatively, arranging the insurance questions or insurance task options included in the list based on relevancy to the user.
<br/><br/> In other words, aspects of the disclosure are directed towards predicting which insurance tasks, questions, or options a user is likely to select at the insurance application, recommending insurance tasks, questions, or options for display to
the user based on these predictions, and providing a user interface display that makes the recommended insurance tasks, questions, or options conveniently accessible for selection by the user.  In order to predict which insurance tasks, questions, or
options will be relevant to a user, the selection trend data store collects and stores selections of multiple users respectively operating multiple insurance applications.  The recommendation engine analyzes the selection trend data to determine which
insurance task, questions, or options are likely to be relevant to the user.
<br/><br/> When recommending a set of insurance tasks, questions, or options for display to a user, the user may be categorized, assigned to, or otherwise associated with a user group.  In turn, the insurance tasks, questions, or options relevant to that
user group may be included in the set of recommended insurance tasks, questions, or options for the user.  Relevancy may be based, for example, on selection frequency.  That is, the recommendation engine may determine that an insurance task, question, or
option frequently selected by multiple users of a user group are likely to be relevant to individual users of the user group.  These and other aspects will be discussed in further detail below.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1 an example of an implementation of an operating environment in which various aspects of the disclosure may be implemented is shown.  In accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, methods, computer-readable media, and
apparatuses are disclosed through which insurance tasks may be recommended for display at an insurance application operating at a mobile computing device.  In certain aspects, an insurance task recommendation system may automatically generate a set of
recommended insurance tasks for presentation at a user interface display of the insurance application.  The automated procedures may utilize various hardware components (e.g., processors, communication servers, memory devices, sensors, etc.) and related
computer algorithms to determine which insurance tasks are relevant to a user that utilizes the insurance application to carry out insurance tasks.  The insurance task recommendation system may determine which insurance tasks are relevant to a user
based, at least in part, on user profile attributes of the user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an insurance task recommendation system 100 (e.g., a computer server) that may be used according to an illustrative embodiment of the disclosure.  The server 101 may have a processor 103 for controlling
operation of various aspects of the insurance task recommendation system 100 and its associated components, including RAM 105, ROM 107, input/output module 109, and memory 115.  The insurance task recommendation system 100 may include multiple servers
101 for controlling operation of respective aspects of the insurance task recommendation system.
<br/><br/> I/O module 109 may include a microphone, keypad, touch screen, and/or stylus through which a user of the server 101 may provide input, and may also include one or more of a speaker for providing audio output and a video display device for
providing textual, audiovisual, or graphical output.  Software may be stored within the memory 115 to provide instructions to the processor 103 for enabling the server 101 to perform various functions.  For example, the memory 115 may store software used
by the server 101, such as an operating system 117, application programs 119, and an associated database 121.  The processor 103 and its associated components may allow the server 101 to run a series of computer-readable instructions to determine which
insurance tasks are relevant to a user and generate a set of recommended insurance tasks.  The server 101 may operate in a networked environment supporting connections to one or more remote computers, such as terminals 141 and 151.  The terminals 141 and
151 may be personal computers or servers that include many or all of the elements described above relative to the server 101.  Also, terminal 141 or 151 may be data stores for storing data relating to insurance tasks, user profiles, and insurance task

computing devices.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 3A, an example of an implementation of an insurance task recommendation system 300 is shown.  As seen in FIG. 3A, the insurance task recommendation system 300 may include an insurance application 302 operating in signal communication via
a network 304 with a recommendation engine 306 at a remote computing device 308.  The insurance applications 302 are designed to assist a user with various insurance-related tasks the user desires to carry out.  The insurance application 302 may be
configured to operate on a mobile computing device 310 and may include a display manager 312 for configuring the insurance task list presented at a user interface display.  The display manager 312 may configure the insurance task list based on a set of
recommended insurance tasks received from the recommendation engine 306.  In FIG. 3A, multiple insurance applications 302 at respective mobile computing devices 310 are shown to be in signal communication with the recommendation engine 306 at the remote
computing device 308.  Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the recommendation engine 306 may be in signal communication with multiple insurance applications 302 to respectively provide insurance task recommendations to those insurance applications.
<br/><br/> The recommendation engine 306 may receive a request from an insurance application 302 for a set of recommended insurance tasks to present to the user in an insurance task list.  In response to receipt of the request, the recommendation engine
306 may identify a user group the user belongs to, determine which insurance tasks are relevant to that user group, and include the relevant insurance tasks in the set of recommended insurance tasks provided to the insurance application 302.  In this
regard, the recommendation engine 306 may be in signal communication with one or more data stores.  In this example, the insurance task recommendation system 300 includes a data store 314 that stores insurance task data, a data store 316 that stores user
profile data, and a data store 318 that stores selection trend data.  The data stores 314-318 may be part of one or more storage modules 320 at the remote computing device 308.
<br/><br/> Insurance task data may include, for example, data indicating which insurance tasks are available at the insurance application 302, data indicating which insurance questions are available at the insurance application, and other data related to
insurance tasks.  Selection trend data may include data indicating the respective task selections of users at the insurance applications 302.  In some example embodiments, the selection trend data may correspond to selection frequencies, e.g., values
indicating the number of times users have respectively selected various insurance tasks at the insurance application 302.
<br/><br/> User profile data may include, for example, data describing the attributes of the users of the insurance applications 302, e.g., a set of user attributes.  User profile data may include, for example, age, gender, marital status, geographic
location, education level, education status, employment experience, credit score, and other demographic information.  Because aspects of the disclosure are directed towards recommending insurance tasks, user profile data may also include
insurance-related information such as, for example, insurance products and services purchased, insurance premiums, insurance policy deductibles, insurance policy coverage limits, and other insurance-related information.  In particular, a user may operate
the insurance application 302 with respect to vehicle insurance, and therefore the user profile data may further include vehicle insurance-related information such as, for example, vehicle make, model, year, country of origin, vehicle classification,
vehicle features, years of driving experience, average yearly mileage, historical driving record, insurance claims record, and other vehicle-related or driving-related information.  It will be appreciated that user profile data may include information
relating to other types of insurance products and services, e.g., business insurance, homeowners insurance, renters insurance, boat insurance, flood insurance, and so forth.
<br/><br/> A database management system (not shown) at the remote computing device 308 may implement an insurance task data model that models the relationships between the insurance task data, the user profile data, and the selection trend data.  The
insurance task data model may be implemented, for example, as one or more databases that define respective database tables, attributes, and relationships corresponding to the insurance task data model.  The respective data stores may thus store and
retain the data described above as respective related or unrelated records in accordance with the insurance task data model.  The relationships between the insurance tasks, user profiles, and selection trends will be discussed further below with
reference to FIGS. 5A-B.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 3B, an example of an alternative implementation of an insurance task recommendation system 350 is shown.  As seen in FIG. 3B, in some example embodiments, the recommendation engine 352 may reside at the mobile computing
device 354 as a component of the insurance application 356.  The recommendation engine 352, in this example, is still in signal communication with the display manager 358 of the insurance application 356 in order to provide insurance task
recommendations.  In this alternative embodiment, however, the recommendation engine 356 may access the insurance task data, user profile data, and selection trend data via a network 360 from respective data stores 360, 362, and 364 located at storage
module 366 of a remote computing device 368.  It will be appreciated with the benefit of this disclosure that additional or alternative configurations, designs, or architectures for the insurance task recommendation systems 300 and 350 may be selectively
employed.
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 4, an example of an implementation of a user interface display 400 of an insurance application 402 is shown.  As seen in FIG. 4, the insurance application 402 may present an insurance task list 404 at the user interface
display 400.  As noted above, the insurance task list 404 presented at the user interface display 400 may be a list of insurance tasks 406, insurance questions, or insurance task options.  The user interface display 400 may include respective user
interface elements 408 (e.g., buttons) for selecting the insurance tasks 406 included in the insurance task list 404.  As noted above, a display manager of the insurance application 402 may configure the insurance task list 404 based on a set of
recommended insurance tasks received from the recommendation engine.  Accordingly, the insurance task list 404 presented at the user interface display 400 may not include all of the insurance tasks available at the insurance application 402 or even all
of the insurance tasks in the set of recommended insurance tasks.  Instead, the display manager may select one or more of the recommended insurance tasks to include in the insurance task list 404 presented at the user interface display 400.  The display
manager may also arrange the insurance tasks 406 included in the insurance task list 404 based on relevancy to the user.  As an example, the display manager may order the insurance tasks 406 according to relevancy where, e.g., the display manager places
the relatively more relevant insurance tasks toward the top of the insurance task list 404.  In some example embodiments, the display manager may place the insurance task determined to be most relevant at the top of the insurance task list 404.
<br/><br/> Selecting one of the insurance tasks 406 may initiate a workflow that walks the user through a series of steps to carry out the insurance task.  Upon arriving at some steps, the insurance application 402 may prompt the user to provide
information or to select an option (e.g., an insurance task option).  The insurance application 402 may proceed through various branches of the workflow depending on which insurance task options the user selects.  As noted above, the insurance task list
404 may be a list of insurance task options, and the insurance tasks included in the insurance task list may be insurance task options.  Accordingly, the insurance application 402 may request from the recommendation engine a set of recommended insurance
task options, which the insurance application may include in the insurance task option list 404 presented to the user.  The display manager of the insurance application 402 may similarly configure the insurance task option list 404 based on relevancy to
the user.  As also noted above, an insurance task list 404 may be a list of insurance questions and the insurance tasks included in the insurance task list may be insurance task questions.  As a result, the display manager of the insurance application
402 may request from the recommendation engine a set of recommended insurance questions, which the display manager may include and configure in the insurance question list 404 presented to the user.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B, respective block diagrams illustrating example relationships between insurance tasks, user profile data, and selection trend data is shown.  In FIGS. 5A-B, the example insurance tasks 500a-c represent
insurance tasks that may be available for selection at the insurance application.  Example embodiments of the insurance task management system may selectively employ various approaches to storing and maintaining selection trend data.  In one approach, as
illustrated in FIG. 5A, relevancy is determined for user groups 502a-d. Accordingly, user groups may be respectively paired with each insurance task 500a-c available at the insurance application, and respective relevancy scores 504a-d may be associated
with each group-task pairing.  In FIG. 5A, a set of user groups 506 paired with a set of insurance tasks 508 is shown.  As seen in FIG. 5A, one of the insurance tasks 500b is associated with a set of relevancy scores 510.  The relevancy scores 504a-d for
the insurance task 500b quantify the relevancy of the insurance task to the respective user groups 502a-d the insurance task is paired with.  In this way, the insurance recommendation system may advantageously rank the insurance tasks 500a-c to determine
which insurance tasks are relatively more relevant to the users associated with the user groups 502a-d and which insurance tasks are relatively less relevant to those users.  For clarity, the sets of relevancy scores respectively associated with the
other insurance tasks 500a and 500c have been omitted.
<br/><br/> To provide an example, consider that the insurance task recommendation system defines three user groups {U1, U2, U3} and that two insurance tasks {T1, T2} are available for selection at the insurance application.  In this example, the group-task
pairings may include a total of six group-task pairings {U1-T1, U1-T2, U2-T1, U2-T2, U3-T1, U3-T2}, and a total of six relevancy scores that indicate the relevancy of the insurance tasks to the user group the insurance task is paired with.  If the
recommendation engine determines that a user belongs to user group U1, then the recommendation engine may analyze the relevancy scores respectively associated with group-task pairings U1-T1 and U1-T2 to determine whether insurance task T1 or insurance
task T2 is more relevant to the user.
<br/><br/> In response to receipt of a user selection from the insurance application of a user, the recommendation engine may adjust a relevancy score (e.g., up or down) depending on whether the user selected the insurance task.  A relevancy score may be,
for example, an absolute selection frequency that simply counts the number of times a particular insurance task was selected.  The insurance application may be configured to provide an indication to the recommendation engine when an insurance task is
selected, and the recommendation engine may increment the selection frequency value for the group-task pairing in response.  In some embodiments, the relevancy score may be a percentage of the number of times a particular insurance task was selected with
respect to the number of times the insurance task was displayed to the user.  The insurance application may be additionally configured provide an indication to the recommendation engine when an insurance application displays an insurance task, and the
recommendation engine may increment a displayed frequency value for the group-task pairing in response.  Accordingly, the relevancy score may be determined by dividing the selection frequency value by the displayed frequency value, e.g., number of times
selected divided by number of times displayed.  In other embodiments, the relevancy score may simply be a value that is normalized from a selection frequency value, selection percentage, combinations thereof, or according to some other approach suitable
for determining the relevancy of an insurance task to a user group.
<br/><br/> The insurance task recommendation system may employ various approaches to defining user groups.  The insurance task recommendation system may define user groups based on the user profile attributes of the users that utilize the insurance
application.  As an example, the insurance task recommendation system may define user groups based on age, e.g., one user group for users aged 16-25, one user group for users aged 26-65, and one user group for users aged 66 and above.  As another
example, the insurance task recommendation system may define user groups based on geographic location, e.g., one user group for users that live in a city, one user group for users that live in the suburbs, and one user group for users that live in rural
areas.  It will be appreciated that the insurance task recommendation system may additionally or alternatively define user groups based on combinations of user profile attributes, e.g., {age, geographic location}, {age, geographic location, vehicle
classification}, {age, gender, marital status, geographic location, vehicle make, model, insurance premium, insurance deductible, .  . . , driving record}, and so forth.  As seen in these examples, the permutations of potential user groups can become
relatively large depending on the number of user profile attributes used to define the user groups and the possible values for those attributes.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5B, illustrates an alternative approach to determining insurance task relevancy.  In FIG. 5B, user profile attributes 550a-d, rather than user groups, are respectively paired with insurance tasks 552a-c. Accordingly, relevancy scores 554a-d
are respectively associated with attribute-task pairings in FIG. 5B.  Similar to the insurance tasks 500a-c in FIG. 5A, the insurance tasks 552a-c in FIG. 5B are also associated with a set of relevancy scores 556.  The relevancy scores 554a-d for the
insurance task 552b likewise quantify the relevancy of the insurance task to the respective user attributes 550a-d the insurance task is paired with.  In this way, the recommendation engine may advantageously rank the insurance tasks 552a-c to determine
which insurance tasks are relatively more relevant to the users respectively associated with the user attributes 550a-d and which insurance tasks are relatively less relevant to users having those attributes.  For clarity, the sets of relevancy scores
respectively associated with the other insurance tasks 552a and 552c have been omitted.
<br/><br/> A user attribute may correspond to an attribute type and specify a value for the attribute type.  Examples of attribute types may include those example attributes identified above, e.g., age, gender, insurance deductible, vehicle make, model,
and so on.  By way of example, a gender user attribute may specify the values {male, female}; an age user attribute may specify the values {16-25; 26-65; and 66+}; and a vehicle classification user attribute may specify the values {business, commute,
personal}.  With the benefit of this disclosure, other attribute types and respective values will be appreciated.
<br/><br/> By associated relevancy scores 554a-d with task-attribute pairings, the insurance task recommendation system may define user groups 558 and 560 in an ad hoc fashion by selecting the user attributes 550-d for a desired user group.  In the user
groups shown by way of example in FIG. 5B, user group 558 includes user attributes 550a, 550b, and 550c and user group 560 includes user attributes 550c and 550d.  The insurance task recommendation system may select relatively few user attributes to
define a broad user group, e.g., a user group defined by age and gender such as {16-25, female}.  Accordingly, the recommendation engine may determine which insurance tasks are relevant to a 16-25 year old female user of the insurance application based
on the selections of insurance tasks from other 16-25 year old female users as indicated by the relevancy scores for those attributes.  The insurance task recommendation system may also select relatively many user attributes to define a narrow user
group, e.g., a user group defined by age, gender, marital status, and vehicle type such as {25-35, male, unmarried, Japanese vehicle}.  In this example, the recommendation engine may determine which insurance tasks are relevant to a 30 year old unmarried
male that drives a Japanese vehicle based on the selections of insurance tasks from other users that match these attributes as indicated by the relevancy scores for those attributes.  It will be appreciated that a user group may be defined by a single
attribute, in which case the disclosures set forth above with respect to FIG. 5A are applicable.
<br/><br/> Because the relevancy scores 554a-d in FIG. 5B are associated with attribute-task pairings rather than group-task pairings, the recommendation engine may aggregate the relevancy scores associated with the attribute-task pairings in order to
obtain an overall or aggregated relevancy score for a defined user group.  Referring to FIG. 6 a block diagram illustrating aspects of an approach to determining insurance task relevancy scores is shown.  As seen in FIG. 6, the recommendation engine may
generate a set of recommended insurance tasks 600 for a user group 602 defined by three user attributes 604a-c. The recommendation engine may obtain the individual relevancy scores 606a-c for an insurance task 608 paired with the user attributes 604a-c
of the user group 602.  The recommendation engine may combine the individual relevancy scores 606a-c for the user attributes 604a-c in order to obtain an aggregated relevancy score 610 for the user group 602.  As noted above, the relevancy scores 606a-c
may be values that quantify the relevancy of the insurance task 608 to the respective user attributes 604a-c. Accordingly, the recommendation engine may sum the values of the individual relevancy scores 606a-c to obtain the aggregated relevancy score
610.
<br/><br/> Moreover, in some example embodiments, weight values 612 may be respectively associated with the user attributes 604a-c, and the recommendation engine may utilize the weight values when determining the aggregate relevancy score 610.  In this
way, the insurance task recommendation system may advantageously identify some user attributes as relatively more important when determining which insurance tasks are relevant to a user based on the attributes 604a-c of the user.  As an example, the fact
that a user drives Japanese cars may contribute more to the identification of relevant insurance tasks than the fact that the user is unmarried.  Accordingly, the recommendation engine may employ a weight value for a vehicle type attribute that is
greater than the weight value for a marital status attribute.
<br/><br/> Therefore, in some example embodiments, the recommendation engine may use the following formula to determine an aggregated relevancy score: R.sub.t=.SIGMA.(R.sub.1.times.w.sub.1)+(R.sub.2.times.w.sub.2) .  . . +(R.sub.n.times.w.sub.n) (Eq.  1)
<br/><br/> where R.sub.t is the aggregated relevancy score for the user group, R.sub.n is the relevancy score associated with the attribute-task pairing and w.sub.n is the weight value for the user attribute.
<br/><br/> The recommendation engine may thus generate a set of recommended insurance tasks 600 based on the aggregated relevancy scores 610a-d respectively associated with the insurance tasks 608a-d. It will be appreciated that the recommendation engine
may also generate a set of recommended insurance tasks based on the relevancy scores associated with the group-task pairings discussed above with reference to FIG. 5A.  As used in this description a set of recommended insurance tasks refers to a
collection or group of one or more insurance tasks.
<br/><br/> The recommendation engine may, in some example embodiments, compare a relevancy score (e.g., an aggregated relevancy score 610) to a predetermined relevancy threshold in order to determine whether to include the insurance task 608 associated
with the relevancy score in the set of recommended insurance tasks 600.  If the relevancy score 610 meets or exceeds (i.e., is not less than) the relevancy threshold, then the recommendation engine may include the insurance task 608 in the set of
recommended insurance tasks 600.  If the relevancy score 610 is less than the relevancy threshold, then the recommendation engine may exclude the insurance task 608 from the set of recommended insurance tasks 600.  As an example, consider a relevancy
score range of 0-100.  The relevancy threshold, in this example, may be set to 70 such that relevancy scores at or above 70 are included in a set of recommended insurance tasks and relevancy scores below 70 are not included in the set of recommended
insurance tasks.  If none of the relevancy scores meet or exceed the relevancy threshold, then the recommendation engine may lower the relevancy threshold or simply include one or more of the insurance tasks having the highest relevancy scores.
<br/><br/> It will be appreciated that the recommendation engine may, in some example embodiments, employ additional factors to determine which insurance tasks are relevant to the user.  In one example, the insurance task recommendation system may maintain
individual usage histories for users of the insurance application indicating the frequency with which the users select respective insurance tasks.  The recommendation engine may analyze and employ the usage history for a user when determining which
insurance tasks are relevant to the user.  In some example embodiments, the recommendation engine may include the insurance tasks most frequently selected by a user in the set of recommended insurance tasks.  The recommendation engine may also employ
additional or alternative formulas to calculate the relevancy score that include values corresponding to the insurance task selection frequencies.  Additionally or alternatively, the recommendation engine may increase or decrease the weight value for an
insurance task based on how often a user selects the insurance tasks.  In this way, the most frequently selected insurance tasks may be displayed and located at or near the top of the insurance task list, and the least frequently selected insurance task
may not be displayed at all.  In another example, the recommendation engine may include insurance tasks in the set of recommended insurance tasks based on the current state of the insurance application, e.g., where the user has reached a particular step,
branch, decision point, and the like in a workflow carried out at the insurance application.  It will further be appreciated that the disclosures discussed above regarding relevancy scores are similarly applicable to determining a set of recommended
insurance task questions as well as a set of recommended insurance task options.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 7, a flowchart 700 of example method steps for configuring a list of insurance tasks presented at a user interface display of an insurance application is shown.  An insurance application may receive a request to display a
list of insurance tasks (step 702).  The request to display the list of insurance tasks may, for example, be trigger by launching, activating, or otherwise operating the insurance application at the mobile computing device.  In response to the request to
display the insurance task list, a set of recommended insurance tasks may be requested from a insurance task recommendation engine (step 704).  A display manager of the insurance application may initiate the request for the set of recommended insurance
tasks.  The request may identify the user of the insurance application, e.g., via name, username, mobile phone number, or other unique identifier.  The recommendation engine may use the unique identifier for the user to retrieve user profile attributes
associated with the user, e.g., from a user profile data store, and analyze the user attributes associated with the user (step 706).  Based on the user attributes, the recommendation engine may identify a user group the user belongs to and assign,
categorize, or otherwise associate the user with the user group (step 708).
<br/><br/> The recommendation engine may then determine which insurance tasks are relevant to other users associated with the user group (step 710), and include the relevant insurance tasks in the set of recommended insurance tasks for the user (step 712). The recommendation engine may provide the set of recommended insurance tasks to, e.g., the display manager of the insurance application (step 714) such that the insurance task list presented at the user interface display includes at least some of the
recommended insurance tasks.  In other words, receipt of the set of recommended insurance tasks at the display manager may trigger configuration of the insurance task list based on the set of recommended insurance tasks.  Having received the set of
recommended insurance tasks, the display manager may select one, some, or all of the recommended insurance tasks for presentation in the insurance task list (step 716).  In some example embodiments, the display manager may arrange the recommended
insurance tasks presented in the insurance task list (step 718), e.g., by ordering the recommended insurance tasks according to their respective relevancy scores.  With the recommended insurance tasks selected and arranged, the insurance application may
present the list of recommended insurance tasks at a user interface display of the mobile computing device (step 720), and the user may select a desired insurance task as needed.  It will be appreciated that the task recommendation system may identify
one or more user groups a user belongs to based upon the social groups the user is associated with on one or more social networks (e.g., <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, LinkedIn, and the like).  The task recommendation system may be in signal communication with a
social network (e.g., via computer network 203 in FIG. 2) to identify one or more social groups the user is associated with and one or more individuals that are also associated with those social groups.  If one or more individuals of those social groups
also utilize the insurance task recommendation system, then the recommendation engine may determine and recommended insurance tasks that are relevant to one or more members of the social group of the user.
<br/><br/> If the desired insurance task is not included in the list of recommended insurance tasks (step 722), then the user may request the display of additional insurance tasks (step 724) until the desired insurance task is displayed.  The insurance
application may receive user input corresponding to a selection of an insurance task (step 726) and execute the selected task (step 728).  The insurance application may also provide an indication of the selection of the insurance task (step 730), e.g., a
selection message.  The recommendation engine, for example, may receive the selection message and update the selection trend data store (step 732) based on the insurance task selection indicated in the selection message.  For example, the recommendation
engine may increment a selection frequency value for the insurance task as well as adjust the relevancy scores for the selected insurance task (step 734).  As discussed above, the relevancy scores may be associated with user group-insurance task pairings
or user attribute-insurance task pairings.  Receipt of the selection message at the recommendation engine may trigger an update the relevancy score for the group-task pairing corresponding to the insurance task selected and the user group the user is
associated with.  Additionally or alternatively, the recommendation engine may update the relevancy score for each attribute-task pairing corresponding to the insurance task selected and the respective user profile attributes of the user.  Updating the
relevancy score may include, for example, increasing or decreasing the relevancy score based on whether a user selected an insurance task associated with the relevancy score.  As set forth above, the user may, in some circumstances, select an insurance
task at the insurance application that was not included in the set of recommended insurance tasks.  In these situations, the selection message may additionally or alternatively indicate that the user selected an insurance task that was not included in
the set of recommended insurance tasks.  The relevancy score for the insurance task selected by the user, in this example, may be similarly increased such that insurance tasks that become relevant to a user may eventually be included in the set of
recommended insurance tasks.
<br/><br/> Examples of recommended insurance task lists 800 and 900 obtained in accordance with the steps above are shown in FIG. 8 and FIG. 9 respectively.  In FIG. 8, the user of the insurance application 802, in this example, is a relatively
inexperienced and high-risk driver associated with a user group defined by 16-20 year old males that drive sports cars and have been involved in a number of vehicle accidents.  Accordingly, based on the selections of other users associated with the
inexperienced and high-risk user group, the recommendation engine may determine that the relevant insurance tasks for this user group include reporting an accident 804a, inquiring about a claim status 804b, asking an insurance question 804c, and locating
a repair shop 804d.  The recommendation engine may include these insurance tasks 804a-d in the set of recommended insurance tasks used to generate the insurance task list 800 presented at the user interface display 806.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 9, the user of the insurance application 902, in this other example, is a relatively experienced and low-risk driver associated with a user group defined by 44-55 year old females with clean driving records that drive vehicles with high
safety ratings.  The recommendation engine may determine that different insurance tasks are relevant for this experienced and low-risk user group based on the selections of other users associated with this group.  For the experienced and low-risk user
group, in this example, the recommendation engine may determine that relevant insurance tasks include initiating a request to speak with an insurance agent 904a, submitting an insurance payment 904b, locating a gas station 904c, and asking an insurance
related question 904d.  The recommendation engine may likewise include these insurance tasks 904a-d in the set of recommended insurance tasks used to generate the insurance task list 900 presented at the user interface display 906.
<br/><br/> As mentioned above, the insurance task list may be a list of insurance-related questions, and the recommendation engine may determine which insurance questions are relevant to a user group based on the selection of insurance questions by users
of that user group.  Examples of recommended insurance question lists 1000 and 1100 obtained in accordance with the steps above are shown in FIG. 10 and FIG. 11.  In FIG. 10, the list of recommended insurance questions 1000 is based on the inexperienced
and high-risk user group of FIG. 8.  As seen in FIG. 10, the list of recommended insurance questions 1000 may include questions relevant to an inexperienced and high-risk driver including questions relating to insurance premiums 1002a, upcoming bills
1002b, insurance policy information 1002c, and general insurance coverage information 1002d.  In FIG. 11, the list of recommended insurance questions 1100 is based on the experienced and low-risk user group of FIG. 9.  Accordingly, the list of
recommended insurance questions 1100 in FIG. 11 may include questions relating to upcoming bills 1102a, specific insurance coverage information 1102b and 1102c, and discount information 1102d.  In this way, the insurance task recommendation system may
advantageously predict which insurance tasks, insurance questions, or insurance task options are likely to be relevant to a user, and automatically present those insurance tasks, questions, or options to the user.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 12, a flowchart 1200 of example method steps for determining a set of recommended insurance tasks is shown.  A recommendation engine may receive a request for a set of recommended insurance tasks (step 1202), analyze user
attributes of a user associated with the request (step 1204), and associate the user with a user group (step 1206).  As discussed above, relevancy scores for the insurance tasks may be associated with user groups or with user attributes.  If relevancy
scores are associated with user attributes (step 1208), then the recommendation engine may obtain the relevancy scores for the attribute-task pairings corresponding to the user attributes of the user (step 1210).  If the user attributes are weighted
(step 1212), then the recommendation engine may apply the weights associated with the user attributes to the respective relevancy scores of the attribute-task pairings (step 1214).  The recommendation engine may then sum the relevancy scores (weighted or
not weighted) in order to obtain an aggregated relevancy score for an attribute-task pairing (step 1216).  Steps 1210-1216 may be repeated for each attribute-task pairing.
<br/><br/> The recommendation engine may then determine whether respective relevancy scores for the group-task pairings or the respective aggregated relevancy scores for the attribute-task pairings exceed a relevancy threshold (step 1218).  If the
relevancy score exceed the relevancy threshold (step 1220), then the recommendation engine may include the insurance task in the set of recommended insurance tasks (step 1222).  If the relevancy score does not exceed the relevancy threshold (step 1220),
then the recommendation may not include the insurance task in the set of recommended insurance tasks (step 1224).  Steps 1218-1224 may be repeated for each group-task pairing or each attribute-task pairing.  It will be appreciated that these example
method steps may be similarly employed to generate a set of recommended insurance questions as well as a set of recommended insurance task options for respective presentation in a list of insurance question or a list of insurance task options.
<br/><br/> As noted above, some example embodiments of the insurance task recommendation system may suggest a particular insurance task to a user in response to a determination that an insurance incident has occurred.  Referring to FIG. 13, a flowchart
1300 of example method steps for suggesting a particular insurance event to a user is shown.  The insurance application may receive a request from the user to display the list of insurance task options (step 1302), e.g., by launching, activating, or
otherwise operating the insurance application.  The display manager of the insurance application may request a set of recommended insurance tasks from the recommendation engine (step 1304).  In some example embodiments, the insurance task recommendation
system may push recommended insurance task options to the insurance application automatically, e.g., in response to a detection of an insurance event at the insurance task recommendation system.
<br/><br/> The recommendation engine may determine that an insurance event has occurred (step 1306).  An insurance event may be any insurance-related occurrence and include, for example, a start of a new insurance premium payment period, a filing of an
insurance claim associated with the user, an update to an existing insurance claim associated with the user, a determination of asset loss, and so forth.  In response to a determination that an insurance event has occurred, the recommendation engine may
identify an insurance task that is suited for responding to the insurance event (step 1308).  The data store of the insurance task recommendation system may store and retain information indicating the occurrence of insurance events for the user. 
Accordingly, the recommendation engine may query the data store for information regarding any insurance events that have occurred with the respect to the user.  As an example, an insurance event may include an increase to an insurance premium for the
insurance policy of the user.  The recommendation system may determine that an insurance premium increase has occurred, and determine that a user might want to know why the insurance premium has increased.  In this example, the recommendation engine may
suggest an insurance question directed towards insurance premium increases.  Insurance events may also include life events for which individuals may wish to review or update their insurance policies.  As an example, the insurance task recommendation
system may determine that a customer has a child that recently turned eighteen years old, e.g., based on profile information stored for the customer.  The insurance task recommendation system may thus suggest that the individual add the child to an
insurance policy.  As another example, the insurance task recommendation system may determine that a new child was recently born to a customer and thus suggest that the customer add the child to a life insurance policy of the customer.  As a further
example, the insurance task recommendation system may determine that a customer recently purchased new furniture and suggest that the customer review the coverage provided by a homeowners insurance policy of the customer.  It will be appreciated with the
benefit of this disclosure that that insurance task recommendation system may be configured to identify additional or alternative life events and in order to recommend insurance-related tasks.
<br/><br/> The insurance application may be configured to prompt acceptance or rejection of the suggested insurance task.  Accordingly, the recommendation engine may be configured to avoid suggesting insurance tasks a user has previously rejected.  If the
user has previously rejected the suggested insurance task (step 1310), then the recommendation engine may determine a recommended set of insurance tasks as normal (step 1312) and provide the set of recommended insurance tasks for display despite the
occurrence of the insurance event (step 1314).
<br/><br/> If the user has not previously rejected the suggested insurance task (step 1310), then the recommendation engine may provide the suggested insurance task, e.g., to the display manager, for presentation to the user (step 1316).  The insurance
application may provide notification that an insurance event has occurred (step 1318) and present the insurance task to the user as a suggested insurance task based on the occurrence of the insurance event (step 1320).  The insurance application may be
configured to prompt the user to accept or reject the suggested insurance task.  If the user accepts the suggestion (step 1322), then the insurance application may execute the suggested insurance task (step 1324).  The insurance application may also
initiate an update to the selection trend data store to indicate that the user accepted the suggestion (step 1326).  If the user does not accept the suggestion (step 1322), then the insurance application may initiate an update to the user profile of the
user in order to indicate that the user rejected the suggestion (step 1328).  In this way, the recommendation engine may avoid recommending the insurance task again for the same insurance event or, additionally or alternatively, insurance events of the
same type.  For example, if the user rejects the suggestion to pay a bill once (or multiple times), then the recommendation engine may not suggest the bill payment task for subsequent bill payment periods.  The insurance application may also initiate an
update to the selection trend data store to indicate that the user rejected the suggestion (step 1330).  Upon rejection of the insurance task suggestion, a set of recommended insurance tasks may be requested (step 1304).
<br/><br/> In accordance with the steps set forth above in FIG. 13, examples of insurance tasks suggestions 1400 and 1500 are shown by way of example in FIGS. 14 and 15.  In FIG. 14, the user interface display 1402 of the insurance application 1404
includes an indication 1406 that an insurance event has occurred, in particular, the beginning of a payment period for an insurance premium.  The recommendation engine may have determined that the insurance task for submitting an insurance premium
payment is suited to respond to the occurrence of this insurance event.  Accordingly, the recommendation engine may suggest the insurance premium payment task 1400 to the display manager of the insurance application 1404, and the display manager may
present the insurance premium payment task at the user interface display 1402.  The display manager may also include a user interface element 1408 to reject (e.g., cancel) the suggestion.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 15, the user interface display 1502 of the insurance application 1504 includes an indication 1506 that an insurance event has occurred, in this example, the detection of an accident involving a vehicle associated with the user. 
Accordingly, the recommendation engine may determine that the insurance task for submitting an insurance claim is suited to respond to this insurance event.  The recommendation engine may thus suggest the insurance claim submission task 1500 to the
display manager of the insurance application 1504.  In response to receipt of the suggested insurance task, the display manager may present the insurance claim submission task 1500 at the user interface display 1502 along with a user interface element
1508 for rejecting the suggestion.
<br/><br/> The foregoing descriptions of the disclosure have been presented for purposes of illustration and description.  They are not exhaustive and do not limit the disclosure to the precise form disclosed.  Modifications and variations are possible in
light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practicing of the disclosure.  For example, aspects of the described implementation include software but aspects of the present disclosure may be implemented as a combination of hardware and software
or in hardware alone.  Additionally, although aspects of the present disclosure are described as being stored in memory, one skilled in the art will appreciate that these aspects can also be stored on other types of non-transitory computer-readable
storage media, such as secondary storage devices, like hard disks, floppy disks, or CD-ROM or other forms of RAM or ROM.
