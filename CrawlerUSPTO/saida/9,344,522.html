       <p> Systems and methods for providing, sharing, storing and playing widgets
     and associated media content on a personal audiovisual device, such as a
     digital photo frame, are described. In one implementation, widgets may be
     selected by a user for rendering based on capabilities of a user's
     device, with the widgets then provided to the device for playback.
     Digital content such as audio files, images, and/or video may be rendered
     in conjunction with playback of the widget. Widgets may be shared between
     users so as to facilitate sharing of media content.

<hr/> <br/><br/>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention is directed generally to the field of personal electronic devices and downloadable applications for rendering and sharing thereon.  More specifically, but not exclusively, the invention relates to systems and methods for
selecting, downloading, rendering and sharing widgets on personal electronic devices such as digital photo frames.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> It is well known that broadband Internet connectivity is becoming substantially more pervasive among consumers as a result of competition among service providers utilizing various different technologies, such as cable, digital subscriber line
(DSL), wireless networks, and satellite.  In many households personal computers (PCs) constitute the primary users of bandwidth furnished by these broadband connections.  In order to facilitate sharing of the Internet connection among PCs in a given
household, a variety of "wired" and "wireless" home networking technologies have been utilized.
<br/><br/> As a result of the impracticality of installing Ethernet cable throughout a residence, RF-based wireless networking technology is becoming increasingly commonplace among consumers.  Although systems based upon the 802.11b, or "Wi-Fi", wireless
networking standard may currently be the most pervasive, versions of the 802.11 standard offering increased bandwidth have been introduced and yet higher-bandwidth approaches have been proposed.  In addition, future wireless networks based on
technologies such as Wi-Max, LTE and others will likely substantially increase available bandwidth.
<br/><br/> Increased bandwidth available to the home has increased the usage of a number of different services, such as Internet-based delivery of digital audio, video and graphic content.  However, since many of these services are facilitated by a desktop
or notebook PC capable of communication over a broadband Internet connection, users are forced to remain physically close to their respective computers in order to utilize these services.  Although other strategies to leverage the availability of
broadband Internet connectivity within the home are currently being developed, many of these approaches involve creation of a relatively powerful, costly centralized communications "hub" (e.g., a PC with enhanced media capabilities, or a multi-purpose
cable set-top box).  Unfortunately, this typically requires either the purchase of an expensive hardware device or extended subscription plan, and constrains the extent to which Internet-enabled entertainment or other services are enjoyed outside of the
immediate vicinity of the centralized hub device.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, there is a need in the art for new technologies for delivering content to user devices such as personal electronic devices.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> The present invention is directed generally towards systems and methods for providing, sharing, sending, receiving and playing widgets in a personal electronics device.  I one exemplary embodiment, a digital photo frame and associated service
provider system may be provided to allow a user to render digital content in conjunction with one or more widgets, as well as send digital content, in conjunction with widgets, to other associated users of the system.
<br/><br/> Various additional aspects of the present invention are further described below in conjunction with the appended drawings. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/>Overview of System of Personalized CHUMBY.TM.  Devices
<br/><br/> Certain of the above-referenced copending applications describe a system comprised of a set of personalized audiovisual devices in Internet-based communication with a service provider.  Such personalized audiovisual devices are commercially
distributed under the trademark CHUMBY.TM., and may also be referred to herein as "CHUMBY.TM.  devices".  During communication with the service provider, each CHUMBY.TM.  device periodically receives a set of application programs, or "widgets", which are
sequentially executed by the CHUMBY.TM.  device after being received from the service provider or locally from a personal computer (e.g., via a USB connection).  Since each CHUMBY.TM.  device is typically Internet-enabled, each may also be remotely
configured and otherwise personalized via the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider through a Web browser executed by a remote terminal (e.g., a PC or wireless handset).  Such personalization may include, for example, specifying the set of widgets provided to a
given CHUMBY.TM.  device as well as their sequence and priority of execution.
<br/><br/> As is described hereinafter, users may configure a CHUMBY.TM.  device via an interface provided by the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider may "drag and drop" icons representative of various widgets onto a rectangular or other portion of the interface
representative of the screen of the CHUMBY.TM.  device being configured.  Alternatively, a user may select textual and/or graphical representations of widgets and select a button or other graphical representation of a user interface (UI) control to "add"
the widget to the CHUMBY.TM.  device being configured.  In these ways the "layout" of the screen of the CHUMBY.TM.  device may be remotely configured by the owner of the device.  Although each CHUMBY.TM.  device will preferably be capable of being
configured in this manner, in certain embodiments each may also come "loaded" with a default set of widgets (e.g., an "alarm clock" widget) disposed to be executed by the CHUMBY.TM.  device upon its registration with the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider. 
Once a CHUMBY.TM.  device has been configured (i.e., with either a "default" or user-specified configuration), it may execute the widgets defined by the configuration without user intervention.  Alternatively, users may opt to "stay" on a given widget by
explicitly instantiating the system interface on the device and selecting a "stay" UI control.  If a user has explicitly selected a widget to "stay", the sequential execution of widgets can be continued by terminating the "stay" command via the system
interface.  If a user interacts with a widget which presents user interface controls to the user through one of a number of alternative input methods, such as via a touchscreen or accelerometer, the currently active widget will continue to execute on the
device until some timeout period expires following the cessation of user interaction with the widget.
<br/><br/> The configuration of a CHUMBY.TM.  device may also specify the events or conditions under which the sequence of execution of widgets is to be altered or interrupted, and allows certain widgets to be accorded the highest available priority with
respect to execution.  For example, an "alarm clock" widget could be granted such priority in order to ensure that its alarm function would not be prevented from being actuated at the scheduled time due to contemporaneous execution of another widget.  In
one embodiment the Web interface provided by the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider is in the form of a "timeline" enabling the sequence of execution of the widgets associated with a given CHUMBY.TM.  device to be controlled in an intuitive manner.  In an
exemplary implementation the timeline defines the order in which the widgets are to be played in a constantly repeating sequence; that is, the timeline is representative of the complete set of widgets played by a given CHUMBY.TM.  device as well as their
relative order and duration of execution.  However, certain widgets (e.g., the "alarm clock" widget) can be specified to be actuated at a given time by appropriately setting the applicable configuration element of such widgets.
<br/><br/> Although in exemplary embodiments it is not contemplated that more than a single "content-related" widget be operative at any given time, a system configuration widget may be utilized to run concurrently with each such content-related widget in
order to, for example, control the relative priority of execution of such content-related widgets and system settings such as loudness, brightness, navigation, and the like.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment CHUMBY.TM.  devices are each capable of wireless communication in accordance with an accepted wireless networking standard, such as the 802.11b or 802.11g standard.  Accordingly, in homes or other environments containing one or
more wireless access points, multiple CHUMBY.TM.  devices may be distributed throughout the coverage area of the access points.  Alternatively, a CHUMBY.TM.  device may use a wired connection as a backup to, or in lieu of, a wireless connection to the
extent convenient or necessary.
<br/><br/> The interface presented by each CHUMBY.TM.  device may be changed in accordance with the nature of the widget currently being executed by the device.  For example, a "clock radio" widget could be employed to produce audio and visual imagery
consistent with a conventional alarm clock at an appointed time in the morning.  In exemplary embodiments the clock radio widget would allow for the selection of a standard "wake up" chime or choice of several different audio programs.  Later in the day
the device interface could be devoted to a rotating selection of several standard information screens such as news headlines, local weather, sports scores, stock market updates, horoscope and the like.
<br/><br/> Users of CHUMBY.TM.  devices may also optionally participate in a "CHUMBY.TM.  Network" along with other users by logging on to a Web site (e.g., www.chumby.com) hosted by the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider.  At this site (also referred to
hereinafter as the "CHUMBY.TM.  site") a user will be able to register with the CHUMBY.TM.  Network and access services enabling the basic capabilities of the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device.  Basic capabilities may comprise, for example, the opportunity to
send/receive widgets and other content to/from other CHUMBY.TM.  users, for improved personalization of the device's generic information features, more detailed alarm-setting capabilities, and better selection and configuration of audio capabilities.
<br/><br/> Registration with the CHUMBY.TM.  Network may enable members of the Network to access a wide array of widgets.  It is contemplated that certain of such widgets would be developed by the entity operating the CHUMBY.TM.  Network while other
widgets would be developed by independent developers.  In addition, members of the "CHUMBY.TM.  Network would also be able to communicate with the CHUMBY.TM.  devices of other members, provided that permission for such communication has been authorized
by the other members.  Such communication could entail, for example, the sending of a widget and corresponding data from the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider to a member of the CHUMBY.TM.  Network (the "receiving member") in response to a request sent to the
CHUMBY.TM.  service provider by another member (the "sending member").  For example, a sending member could, after receiving permission from a receiving member, request the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider to send a "photo-viewer" widget to the receiving
member.  In addition, the sending member could specify that a link be established between the photo-viewer widget and pictures uploaded by the sending member to the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider.  In this way the receiving member could, without any effort
other than providing authorization to the sending member, enable their CHUMBY.TM.  device to essentially automatically receive and display a sequence of photos provided by the sending member.  Similarly, while traveling a sending member could send a
personalized "wake up" message to the CHUMBY.TM.  device of a consenting receiving member.  Finally, a sending member could send widgets to a group of receiving members included on a "buddy list" of the sending member, which could be established after
the receipt of suitable permissions from those proposed to be included on the list.
<br/><br/> In an exemplary embodiment members of the CHUMBY.TM.  Network are enabled to completely configure, through any Web browser, their respective CHUMBY.TM.  devices by specifying a set of "premium" widget programs or content to play or be shown
rotationally (or in some other user-defined sequence) on their respective CHUMBY.TM.  devices.  Such premium widgets and content may include, for example, webcam shots, RSS readers, filtered news reports, personalized stock performance data, short
animations or movies, podcasts or audio files to function as the audio sources for alarms or reminders scheduled to be triggered at different times throughout the day.
<br/><br/> It is noted that the word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other
embodiments.
<br/><br/>Example System Components
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a set of networked components comprising an embodiment of the system 100 of the invention.  As shown, the system 100 comprises one or more CHUMBY.TM.  personal audiovisual devices 102 in communication with
a central service provider 106 via one or more access networks 110 and the Internet 116.  These personal audiovisual devices may also be referred to herein for brevity as a personal device, personal electronic device, or CHUMBY.TM.  device.  As those
skilled in the art will appreciate, the access networks 110 are representative of various intermediary network routing and other elements between the Internet 116 and the CHUMBY.TM.  personal audiovisual devices 102.  Such intermediary elements may
include, for example, gateways or other server devices, and other network infrastructure provided by Internet service providers (ISPs).  As is discussed below, the CHUMBY.TM.  personal audiovisual devices 102 obtain application programs ("widgets") for
execution from the central service provider 106 or locally from a mass storage device, personal computer or other computing device.  The central service provider 106 may also be referred to herein as a widget server, content and widget provision system,
provision system or by other readily identifiable terminology.  In this regard the service provider 106 typically contains a repository of widgets and has access to other content capable of being communicated to a given CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 upon the
request of its authorized user or another user to which appropriate permission has been granted.
<br/><br/> Referring again to FIG. 1, the system 100 also includes a plurality of user computers 120 disposed for communication with the service provider 106 via an access network (not shown) and the Internet 116.  Each user computer 120 executes a Web
browser 122 capable of displaying Web pages generated by the service provider 106 through which a user may configure one or more CHUMBY.TM.  personal audiovisual devices 102.  As mentioned above, such configuration may include, for example, specifying a
set of widgets to be sent to a particular device 102 and their sequence of execution, adjusting audio or visual parameters relating to such execution, defining and managing a user's CHUMBY.TM.  network (including, for example, defining a "buddy list"
comprised of other CHUMBY.TM.  users with respect to which the device 102 is permitted to communicate), and defining the layout or other aspects of the user interface presented through the screen of the device 102.  To this end a given Web browser 122
may, when in communication with the service provider 106, present a rectangular configuration window which displays the widgets currently configured to "play" within the named "channel".  By "dragging and dropping" iconic representations of widgets or
content files into such a configuration window, a user may personalize the behavior and user interface presented by the corresponding CHUMBY.TM.  device 102.  Alternatively, a user may select textual and/or graphical representations of widgets and select
a button or other graphical representation of a user interface control to "add" the widget to the CHUMBY.TM.  device being configured.  Moreover, users may access the service provider 106 via a Web browser 122 for the purpose of sending widgets or other
information to other users for execution or display by their respective CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102.  In one embodiment the service provider 106 maintains a record of the permissions granted among users of CHUMBY.TM.  devices in order to determine which
users are authorized to provide, via the service provider 106, a given user with widgets, messages or other information, and vice-versa.  Such permissions may be granted or withdrawn by a given user via appropriate pages presented by a Web browser 122 in
communication with the service provider 106.
<br/><br/> In the exemplary embodiment a configuration window may be utilized to configure one or more CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102 consistent with the permissions granted by the users of such devices 102.  In addition, a user of a given CHUMBY.TM.  device 102
may elect to have the interface of the device 102 "mirror" or otherwise replicate that of another device 102 subject to the requisite permissions being granted.  Similarly, one or more CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102 may be configured to mirror the interface for
a "virtual" CHUMBY.TM.  device (or vice-versa) defined via a configuration window.
<br/><br/> Different users of a given CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 may be accorded different roles or privileges in configuring the device 102.  For example, user-granted supervisory privileges could be given the authority to filter or monitor the widgets or
content sent to the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102.  This would enable, for example, parents to manage and/or monitor the widgets and content executed and displayed by the one or more CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102 used by their children.  Moreover, administrators of
the system 100 would typically possess an elevated level of privilege relative to users of CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102 within the system 100.  Also, if a specific widget performs functions requiring communication with a web site controlled by a third party
in order to access content, the developer of the widget may create a hierarchical user model to regulate such access (and perhaps the functions of the widget).
<br/><br/> Attention is now directed to FIG. 2, which illustrates an exemplary distribution of CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102 throughout a residence 200 or other building having a number of rooms 204.  In the embodiment of FIG. 2, each CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 is
equipped with wireless transceiver (e.g., a Wi-Fi transceiver) to facilitate communication with one or more access points 210.  Each access point is interconnected with an access network 110 by way of, for example, a local area network, thereby enabling
Internet-based communication to be established between the service provider 106 and the devices within the residence 200.
<br/><br/> Turning now to FIG. 3, a block diagrammatic representation is provided of the principal components of an embodiment of a CHUMBY.TM.  device of the present invention.  As shown, the device includes a central processing unit (CPU) 302, memory
including volatile (e.g., SDRAM) 306 and non-volatile memory 310 (e.g., flash memory), an audio interface 312, a wireless communications interface 314, and a sensor interface 370.  In an exemplary implementation the CPU 302 comprises a microprocessor
(e.g., based upon an ARM core) configured to run a Linux kernel and having attendant capabilities for graphics rendering.  The device may or may not include a battery backup unit, which serves to preserve real-time information in the event of a power
outage, and may also serve as a primary power source if the user desires untethered operation.  The battery may or may not be rechargeable.  The operating system is made aware of the power status and actively configures the CHUMBY.TM.  device and the
running widget to either save power or modify the user interface consistent with untethered operation.
<br/><br/> The device may or may not include a Security Module (not shown) If included, the Security Module serves to store secrets and compute authentication algorithms in a fashion that fully isolates core security routines from otherwise unsecured code
running on CPU 302.  The secret storage and authentication capability may or may not be used by the client-server communication protocol to enable authenticated and encrypted communication capabilities for, among other things, financial transactions. 
The Security Module is initialized in such a way that there is no default mapping of the secrets contained within the module versus the identity of the hardware of the user.  Furthermore, the secrets are revocable and a routine may exist for generating
new secrets based upon a master secret that is never associated with a specific user's profile.  This enables opt-in policies for privacy and a limited ability to revoke identity information, barring forensic network analysis, thereby enabling anonymity
as well.  The anonymous trust network can be extended with a variety of client-server protocols to enable a wide range of anonymous transactions, including but not limited to cash and content transactions.
<br/><br/> As shown, software comprising widgets 350 or other applications received from the service provider 106 are stored in memory 310 and loaded into SDRAM 306 or non-volatile memory 310 for execution by the CPU 302.  In one embodiment widgets are
downloaded from the service provider 106 to CHUMBY.TM.  devices in the format of a "Adobe Flash" file, also referred to as a "Flash movie".  As is known by those skilled in the art, Flash movies are usually accorded a ".swf" file extension and may be
played by a Flash Player developed and distributed by Adobe Systems.  Accordingly, the memory 310 also includes a Flash Player 360 as well as a copy of the operating system 364 executed by the CPU 302.  In other embodiments widgets may be developed in
accordance with other formats and played by players compatible with such other formats.
<br/><br/> In the exemplary embodiment widgets are not "permanently" stored in memory 310 of CHUMBY.TM.  devices.  Rather, widgets are executed by the CPU and then either discarded or cached in temporary memory for future use.  This enables widgets to be
"pushed" from the service provider 106 as necessary to support the sequence of widget execution specified for each CHUMBY.TM.  device.  That is, the service provider 106 may operate to provide a "stream" of widgets to each CHUMBY.TM.  device, where the
widgets within each such stream are temporarily cached within the memory of the applicable CHUMBY.TM.  device until their execution.  This enables the service provider 106 and/or the creator of each widget program to maintain a degree of control over the
content and behavior of each widget program, since each such program is typically not permanently downloaded (thereby facilitating modification) but is rather temporarily cached and erased after some predetermined time has passed or a memory use
threshold has been reached.
<br/><br/> The CHUMBY.TM.  device also includes a liquid crystal display (LCD) 320 controlled by an LCD controller 322, which may or may not be integrated into the CPU 302.  The display 320 visually renders iconic representations of the widget programs
stored within the CHUMBY.TM.  device and images generated in connection with the execution of such widgets by the CPU 302.  In an exemplary implementation a touchscreen 330 overlays the LCD 320 and is responsive to a touchscreen controller 334.  In one
embodiment a user may induce the CHUMBY.TM.  device to enter a "control panel mode" by touching the a sensor such as the squeeze sensor (not shown in FIG. 3), touchscreen 330 or other sensor device.  In an exemplary embodiment, widgets and the system
control panel may present the user with different "user interface", or "UI", elements to enable the user to interact with the widget/system control panel.  These UI elements may include, but are not limited to, buttons, scroll bars, drop down combo boxes
and menus.  When a user touches the screen to interact with one of these UI elements, the touchscreen controller 334 informs the CPU 302 that the touchscreen has been touched at a specific location and that location is converted by the CPU 302 to a UI
control actuation event based on the configuration of the currently displayed widget 350 or system control panel screen (not shown in FIG. 3).  In alternate implementations the LCD 320 and touchscreen 330 may comprise an integral device controlled by an
integrated controller.
<br/><br/> Turning to FIG. 4, there is shown an exemplary user interface 400 generated by the LCD 320 during operation of the CHUMBY.TM.  device in control panel mode.  As shown, the interface 400 defines an mute button 404, a channel button 406, a night
button 408, a music button 410, a settings button 412, a clock button 414, a delete button 418, a rate button 420, a send button 422, a stay button 424, a right arrow button 428, a left arrow button 426, and a hide control panel mode button 416. 
Selection of the mute button 404 toggles the mute state of the CHUMBY.TM.  device.  Selection of the channel button 406 instantiates another control panel screen which enables users to view the content of all of their CHUMBY.TM.  "channels" and/or select
a new "channel" to be loaded and run on the CHUMBY.TM.  device.  A "channel" is a collection of widgets configured by a user in a named grouping via an interaction between a page rendered on a web browser 122 and the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider, such
collection of widgets generally running on the CHUMBY.TM.  device in a sequential, repetitive fashion.
<br/><br/> Selection of the night button 408 places the CHUMBY.TM.  device into a "night mode" in which the screen is dimmed and a low intensity clock is displayed.  Selection of the music button 410 instantiates another control panel screen which enables
the user to interact with and control various continuous music sources, such as, for example, MP3 players, storage devices, and music services.  Such sources may reside on either the local network or on the Internet.  Selection of the settings button 412
instantiates another control panel screen which enables the user to configure various CHUMBY.TM.  device settings, such as, for example, wireless network setup, speaker volume and touchscreen calibration.  Selection of the clock button 414 instantiates
another control panel screen which enables the user to configure the time, date and alarm functions of CHUMBY.TM.  device.  Selection of the delete button 418 deletes the currently displayed widget to be deleted, with user confirmation, from the current
"channel".  Selection of the rate button 420 instantiates another control panel screen which enables the user to provide a rating on a fixed scale for the currently displayed widget.  Selection of the send button icon 422 instantiates another control
panel screen which displays a personalized list of other users of CHUMBY.TM.  users to which it may be desired to send widgets or otherwise communicate.  Selection of the stay button 424 toggles the "stay" state of the currently selected widget.  When
the "stay" state of a widget is selected, the widget plays continuously on the CHUMBY.TM.  device.  Selection of the right arrow button 426 or left arrow button 428 causes the CHUMBY.TM.  device to display the previous or next widget in the channel,
respectively.  A user may, from any Web browser 122, access a Web page generated by the service provider 106 and designate a "favorite" widget.  Alternatively, a user may press a virtual, touchscreen-based button on his or her CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 to
designate the current widget as the new "favorite" widget.  When the user then selects the heart-shaped icon (not shown in FIG. 4) on his or her CHUMBY.TM.  device, an iconic representation of this favorite widget (e.g., a clock widget) replaces the
heart-shaped icon and enables the user to immediately activate (i.e., cause the CPU 302 to execute) the program instructions corresponding to such favorite widget.  Alternatively, selection of the heart-shaped icon (or other predefined icon) results in
the CHUMBY.TM.  device becoming configured in accordance with a "favorite" or other profile rather than executing a favorite widget.  Of course, certain profiles may be specified to include only a single widget such as, for example, an "alarm clock" or
"photo viewer widget.
<br/><br/> Referring again to FIG. 4, selection of the right arrow button 426 advances one widget in a user-defined (or default) widget sequence ("channel"), or just skips ahead in implementations in which widgets are chosen to be displayed randomly. 
Similarly, selection of the left arrow button 428 results in "going back" one widget in the user-defined (or default) widget sequence ("channel").  As the buttons 426 and 428 are selected, an iconic representation or avatar corresponding to the currently
active widget is displayed in a display box 430.  If it is desired to return to the currently active widget, the hide control panel mode button 416 is selected and the control panel mode interface 400 changes to a screen through which the user views the
sequence of widgets currently configured to be executing on the CHUMBY.TM.  device.
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments a physical button element (not shown) may be provided proximate the LCD screen 320 to enable navigation through menus and the like presented by the LCD screen 320.  In one implementation this button element is cross-shaped
in order to facilitate two-dimensional navigation, and may further include a smaller, dedicated button (e.g., in the center of the cross) associated with a specific widget (e.g., clock widget).  Pressing this dedicated widget would interrupt the
operation of all other widgets.
<br/><br/> In implementations in which two-dimensional navigation through the user interface of the CHUMBY.TM.  device is supported, users may be provided with the ability to navigate forward and back in the configured widget timeline.  Similarly, users
may navigate up and down a stack of related widgets.  This function depends on the implementation of the concept of widget categories--i.e., associating widgets into logical categories that can be displayed sequentially, if configured to be displayed. 
An example of a category could be "News".  Widgets included within this category could include, for example, a local news widget, a sports news widget, an entertainment news widget, a business news widget, and the like.  For each category, there would be
a default widget, which is designated by the user on the CHUMBY.TM.  web site for each category selected to be displayed by the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device.
<br/><br/> If more than one widget in a category is selected, then the widgets are conceptually "stacked" with the default widget being: on the top of the stack; and the widget that is displayed as the CHUMBY.TM.  device automatically cycles through
configured widgets.
<br/><br/> If a widget for a given category (e.g., "News") is displayed and there exist additional widgets in the category which are also configured for display, then in the exemplary embodiment these additional widgets are "stacked" below the displayed
widget.  In this case the user may take some predefined action with respect to the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device (e.g., perhaps selecting a control on the touchscreen or accessing a function via the control panel, which is instantiated via actuating the
squeeze sensor) in order to cause the next widget in the "stack" for that category to be displayed.  The CHUMBY.TM.  device may be configured such that taking further predefined actions of the same type will cause the widgets either above or below in the
stack to be displayed, as designated by the user.  The last widget that is displayed in the stack for the applicable category when the CHUMBY.TM.  device cycles to the next widget category will be the widget displayed in the next cycle for the just
exited category (e.g, News).
<br/><br/> The tabular illustration below provides a conceptual layout of exemplary widget stacks in various categories:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 ##STR00001##
<br/><br/> The following provides a conceptual representation of the case in which the user has navigated into widget stacks for News, Entertainment and Sports:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00002 ##STR00002##
<br/><br/> Example CHUMBY.TM.  Service Provider
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 5, a block diagrammatic representation is provided of the server components and other infrastructure which may be utilized to facilitate the operations of the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider 106.  It is understood that the
representation of FIG. 5 is functional in nature, and single or multiple computers may be adapted to execute software designed to perform one or more than one of the functions described below.  For example, the functionality provided by the load
balancers 704 may be provided by a single load balancing device or multiple load balancing devices.  Similarly, each of the servers represented in FIG. 5 may be realized using either a single server computer or using a cluster comprised of primary,
secondary and backup server computers interconnected in configurations familiar to those skilled in the art.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 5, one or more Web servers 710 are used to define the Web interface presented by the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider 106 to users or other interested parties.  A system database 712 may include, among other things, CHUMBY.TM.  user
account information, CHUMBY.TM.  device configuration information, CHUMBY.TM.  widget configuration and instance information, marketing materials, press information, and contact information relating to the CHUMBY.TM.  service that is served by the Web
servers 710.  Also included may be information relating to registration and first-level support.
<br/><br/> A user account server 714 maintains user account data in the system database 712 and provides authentication services to the other servers depicted in FIG. 5.
<br/><br/> One or more widget servers 718 are used to serve widgets to CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102.  Each widget server 718 will typically be sufficiently powerful to encrypt and sign widgets on demand.  In addition, each server 718 will be configured to
"store-and-forward" widgets being sent from one user to another.
<br/><br/> The service provider 106 may also utilize a number of content servers 724 to provide information (e.g., new, weather, stock market information) to CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102.  In an exemplary embodiment all content servers function in a "pull" mode
of operation; that is, CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 polls the applicable content server 724 for new data on some periodic basis.  Each response from a content server 724 preferably contains the schedule and frequency for subsequent polls.  For example, a
content server 724 disposed to provide stock market information can change the polling frequency to reflect whether or not the stock market is open.  In other implementations a CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 may be provided with the capability to change polling
frequencies on the basis of, for example, environmental conditions (e.g., ambient room brightness) or other factors.  One or more of the content servers 724 may be used for serving certain types of content uploaded by users for use on their own or other
CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102 and stored within the system database 712.
<br/><br/> The CHUMBY.TM.  service provider 106 will typically maintain a small number of load-balanced Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers 730 to provide time to CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102.  Each such server 730 will be configured to fetch their time from a
"primary" NTP server, which fetches time from an upstream external public NTP server.  If the primary NTP server 730 is inoperative, secondary NTP servers 730 will synchronize with a random selection of upstream servers.  If all servers 730 are
unavailable, a CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 will either fetch time information from random public NTP servers or simply have its time adjusted via user input.  In one embodiment each CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 requests time upon connecting to the Internet and at
jittered intervals thereafter, no more frequently than once a day.
<br/><br/> Turning now to FIG. 6, a database model diagram is provided of an exemplary object-oriented database schema 800 utilized by the system database 712.  As shown, the schema 800 includes the following tables: buddies, categories, CHUMBY.TM. 
devices, parameters, profiles, skins, users, widget instance, widgets, ratings, registrations, activations, movies, templates, thumbnails.  Each rectangular object in FIG. 6 is an entity object representation of a table in the database 712, with the
primary key denoted with the acronym "PK"; ownership relationships indicated by dashed arrows which originate at the owned entity and terminate at the owning entity, and which are keyed by the asterisked column in the owned object; and solid arrows
indicating a relationship between entities.  Although the type of information contained within a number of these tables will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the discussion herein, a simplified example of various steps performed
during user registration and the adding of a widget to a "profile" is provided in order to further illuminate the structure of the database schema 800.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment the user registration and account creation process is initiated by a user through submission, via a Web browser 122, of a CHUMBY.TM.  ID so as to identify a particular CHUMBY.TM.  device 102.  The act of creating a user account
results in the construction of a default profile and one or more widget instances, each of which is automatically assigned to the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 (as identified by its CHUMBY.TM.  ID) currently being registered.  When a user adds a widget to the
user's profile, the user is presented with a list of potential categories based upon information within the categories table.  The user then selects a category from the categories table, and the user is presented with a list of widgets belonging to the
chosen category.  After the user chooses a widget, a widget instance is constructed and information is entered into the appropriate fields (e.g., profile id, widget id, index).  The user is then presented a user interface via the Web browser 122 for
editing the widget-specific parameters associated with the selected widget.  In response to the user's parameter selections, records are appropriately updated in the parameters table.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 19A-19H provide a more comprehensive tabular representation of an exemplary object-oriented database schema capable of being utilized by the system database 712.
<br/><br/>System Operation
<br/><br/>Client-Server Communication Protocol
<br/><br/> In general, it is contemplated that embodiments of the invention will be implemented such that each CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 will function as a client relative to various servers existing within the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider 106.  In these
embodiments the CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102 do not engage in direct communication with each other, but may do so via independent client-sever relationships established with the service provider 106.  In this way the service provider 106 may facilitate the
communication of a variety of different types of executable files (e.g., widgets or other computer programs, audio clips, short "Flash" movies, etc.) among CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102, subject to the permission of the content owner and potential recipient. 
A user may designate that a widget or other content be sent to another user, or to the members of a user's "buddy list" or the like.  This designation may be made via a Web browser 122 in communication with the service provider 106, or directly through
the interface of the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device 102.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment executable files may be created by users of CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102 or other third parties and loaded within the system database 712 after being approved by the entity operating the service provider 106.  Once a widget or other
executable file has been created and stored within the system database 712, it is made available for use by all those users of CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102 that have been granted the requisite permission.  Various schemes for granting permissions among and
between users are possible.  For example, one such type of permission could entail that any user X that is given permission by a user Y to send widgets to user Y's CHUMBY.TM.  device may select any widget for which user X has usage rights and "send" such
widget to user Y's CHUMBY.TM.  device.  Other restrictions could be placed on the transferability of widgets or other files from the service provider 106 to a CHUMBY.TM.  device at the request of another user.  For example, a user could be provided with
the capability to "lock" certain widgets on only the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device, or a CHUMBY.TM.  device could reach a "full" state and advertise itself as being incapable of receiving any additional widgets.
<br/><br/> Although widgets and other executable files could be transferred between the service provider 106 and CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102 in a number of different formats, in one embodiment such transfers will occur in the Flash movie format (i.e., as .swf
files, when not signed or encrypted).  In this case the process for downloading widgets from the service provider 106 includes receiving a notification at a CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 that a "new" widget is ready for downloading.  Since in the exemplary
embodiment each CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 acts in a "pull" mode, each device 102 periodically polls the service provider and inquires as to whether any configuration changes are available to load.  In the case in which a new widget is available for
downloading, the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 will generally use standard HTTP (or HTTPS) protocols in downloading the applicable widget file.
<br/><br/> Attention is now directed to FIGS. 9-13, which are a series of signal flow diagrams representative of the client-server communication protocol established between a CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 and the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider 106.  As mentioned
above, each CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 functions as a client relative to the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider 106.  In one embodiment the basic protocol established between each CHUMBY.TM.  device and the corresponding server entity of the CHUMBY.TM.  service
provider 106 may be characterized as XML using a Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture transmitted using HTTP.  In general, the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 issues periodic HTTP GET or POST requests and the service provider 106 responds with a
block of XML.  The CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 will use HTTP GET for relatively simple requests, and POST for more complex requests, which will be in encapsulated in XML.  Individual data elements are uniquely identified by Global Unique Identifiers (GUID). 
In one embodiment, there will be some form of cryptographic key exchange and transactions will be encrypted using those keys.  Furthermore, XML may be compressed in order to facilitate transfer between the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 and the CHUMBY.TM. 
service provider 106.
<br/><br/> Each CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 will have a unique GUID.  In some embodiments, time codes will be represented in ISO-8061 format.
<br/><br/> Requesting a CHUMBY.TM.  Configuration
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 7, a signal flow diagram 900 illustratively represents one manner in which a "CHUMBY.TM.  configuration" is provided to a CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 by the service provider 106.  In one embodiment each CHUMBY.TM.  device 102
operates in accordance with a configuration, which specifies the profile to be loaded by the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 under various conditions.  The user specifies the profile for the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 via a web interface at the CHUMBY.TM.  web site. 
The profile contains several operational parameters for the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 7, the requesting of a configuration is initiated when the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 sends an HTTP GET request containing the GUID of the requested configuration to a CHUMBY.TM.  configuration object within the system database 712
maintained by the service provider 106 (stage 902).  An example of such a request is provided below:
<br/><br/> http://server.chumby.com/xml/chumbies/CB6A8A20-DFB8-11DA-98FA-00306555C86- 4
<br/><br/> The service provider 106 receives the request (stage 904), and retrieves the requested configuration from the system database 712 (stage 908).  If the requested configuration exists, the service provider responds with an XML-based configuration;
if not, the service provider 106 responds with an XML-based error message (stage 912).  An exemplary XML-based response generated by the service provider 106 is given below:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00003 &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;chumby id="CB6A8A20-DFB8-11DA-98FA-00306555C864"&gt; &lt;name&gt;Bathroom&lt;/name&gt; &lt;profile href="/xml/profiles/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001" name="Default"
id="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"/&gt; &lt;user username="Frank" href="/xml/users/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001" id="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"/&gt; &lt;/chumby&gt;
<br/><br/> Once the response is received by the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102, it is processed by the Master Controller (stage 916).  If an error is instead received, it is processed by the Master Controller as well (stage 920).
<br/><br/> Requesting a Profile
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 8, a signal flow diagram 1000 illustratively represents one manner in which a "profile" is provided to a CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 by the service provider 106.  In one embodiment each CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 operates in accordance
with a profile, which specifies the set of widgets to be executed by the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 under various conditions.  This enables a user to specify that a certain subset of the available set of widgets is to be instantiated and utilized during a
particular time frame, based upon the location of the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 or the skin (or housing) within which the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 is currently seated.  For instance, the user may desire that local weather and traffic information be
provided while the user is located at home, but would prefer that airline flight information be available from the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 when the user is traveling.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 8, the requesting of a profile is initiated when the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 sends an HTTP GET request containing the GUID of the requested profile to a profile object within the system database 712 maintained by the service
provider 106 (stage 1002).  An example of such a request is provided below:
<br/><br/> http://server.chumby.com/xml/profiles/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000- 1
<br/><br/> The service provider 106 receives the request (stage 1004), and retrieves the requested profile from the system database 712 (stage 1008).  If the requested profile exists, the service provider responds with an XML-based profile; if not, the
service provider 106 responds with an XML-based error message (stage 1012).  An exemplary XML-based response generated by the service provider 106 is given below:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00004 &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;profile id="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"&gt; &lt;name&gt;Default&lt;/name&gt; &lt;description&gt;Default profile for your Chumby&lt;/description&gt; &lt;user

<br/><br/> Once the response is received by the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102, it is processed by the Master Controller (stage 916).  If an error is instead received, it is processed by the Master Controller as well (stage 920).
<br/><br/> Each Profile has a name, a description, a skin, and a list of "Widget Instances".  The Profile will be periodically refetched in order to reflect changes made by the owner, for instance, adding and removing Widget Instances.  The Profile may
also contain a "buddies_of" node, which contains information about users and profiles that have indicated the owner of the Profile to be a "buddy" in order to facilitate the sending of widget instances.
<br/><br/> The CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 processes each Widget Instance in turn, fetching the settings for each widget, and the Widget itself, and displays the Widget with the settings encapsulated by the Widget Instance.
<br/><br/> A process similar to that described with reference to FIG. 7 may be used to change a profile.  An example of an HTTP POST containing an the GUID of the profile to modify and an XML-based request to change a profile generated by the CHUMBY.TM. 
device 102 is given below:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00005 http://server.chumby.com/xml/profiles/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001- &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;profile id="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"&gt; &lt;name&gt;Default&lt;/name&gt;

&lt;/widget_instances&gt; &lt;/profile&gt;
<br/><br/> Widget Instance Upload/Download
<br/><br/> Turning now to FIGS. 11-12, there are shown signal flow diagrams representative of the communication of widget instance information from the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 to the service provider 106, and vice-versa.  In one embodiment the set of
parameters associated with a widget instance determine the user-specified manner in which the behavior of the widget is modified when executed by a CHUMBY.TM.  device 102.  That is, the parameters fetched by the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 from the service
provider 106 for a given widget constitute the user's "customized" settings, rather than dynamic content.  For example, in the case of a "stock ticker" widget the applicable parameters could comprise the names and symbols of the stocks within the user's
portfolios, but would not define or relate to the current prices of the stocks (which would be furnished by another service supplied by the service provider 106).
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a signal flow diagram which depicts processing of changes made to the parameters of a widget instance through the interface of the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 in which the widget is instantiated.  Examples of parameter changes could include
changing a location of interest in the case of a "weather" widget, or adding/removing stock ticker symbols in the case of a "stock market" widget.  In the exemplary embodiment it is not necessary for the user to set or otherwise modify all parameters of
a given widget, and the service provider 106 will effectively "expand" the parameter change data into a full parameter record once received.  For instance, a zip code could be sufficient to uniquely identify a location in the case of a weather widget,
and the associated city, state, etc. could be supplied to the applicable record during processing of the parameter change request by the service provider 106.
<br/><br/> As shown, the widget instance change operation is initiated when the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 sends an HTTP POST and an XML request to a widget instance object within the system database 712 maintained by the service provider 106 (stage 1102). 
This type of "UPLOAD" operation informs the service 106 that the parameters of a specific widget instance have been updated by the applicable user.  As shown, the updated parameters are received by the service provider (stage 1104), and are attempted to
be written to a corresponding widget instance object within the system database 712 (stage 1108).  If this attempted write operation is unsuccessful (stage 1112), the service provider 106 responds with an error message that is processed by the requesting
CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 (stage 1120).  If the write operation is successful, the newly updated widget instance are retrieved from the system database 712 (stage 1116) and sent to the applicable CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 (stage 1120).
<br/><br/> Once received, the widget instance is processed by the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 (stage 1124).  In general, the processing of the parameters contained in a widget instance are dependent upon the characteristics of the particular widget.  In certain
cases the parameters may be sufficient to enable the widget to display information, while other widgets may use the parameters to fetch content from another service.  As an example of the former, consider a "clock" widget capable of displaying
information following receipt of a parameter indicating a time zone.  In contrast, a "stock widget" may have stock symbols as parameters and use such symbols to fetch quote information.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 10, there is shown a signal flow diagram illustrating an exemplary widget instance download operation in which the service provider 106 is requested to push values of widget-specific parameters to a requesting CHUMBY.TM. 
device 102.  The requesting of a parameter download is initiated when the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 sends an HTTP GET containing the GUID of the requested widget instance request to a parameter object within the system database 712 maintained by the service
provider 106 (stage 1202).  An example of such a request in the case of a "weather" widget is provided below:
<br/><br/> http://server.chumby.com/xml/widgetinstances/5D81823A-E77D-11DA-B4BD-0030- 6555C864
<br/><br/> The service provider 106 receives the request (stage 1204), and retrieves the requested parameters from the system database 712 (stage 1208).  If the requested parameters exist, the service provider 106 responds with an XML-based widget instance
message (stage 1212).  Using the example of a weather widget, which utilizes a zip code to identify the location for which weather is to be retrieved, such a message could comprise:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00007 &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;widget_instance id="5D81823A-E77D-11DA-B4BD-00306555C864"&gt; &lt;widget href="/xml/widgets/BF4CE814-DFB8-11DA-9C82-00306555C864" id="BF4CE814- DFB8-11DA-9C82-00306555C864"/&gt;
&lt;profile href="/xml/profiles/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001" id="00000000-0000-0000- 0000-000000000001"/&gt; &lt;access access="private"/&gt; &lt;mode time="10" mode="timeout"/&gt; &lt;received buddy="9790F788-07DB-11DC-A700-0017F2D98B02"
forward="true" accepted="false"/&gt; &lt;widget_parameters&gt; &lt;widget_parameter id="BF4CE814-DFB8-11DA-9C82-00306643C864"&gt; &lt;name&gt;ZipCode&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;92037&lt;/name&gt; &lt;/widget_parameter&gt; &lt;/widget_parameters&gt;
&lt;/widget_instance&gt;
<br/><br/> The CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 uses the GUID in the "widget" tag to fetch the information about the Widget to be displayed.  Once the widget has been started, it is passed the name/value pairs in the "widget parameters" section, in order to
customize the behavior of the widget.  The "mode" tag indicates how long the widget is to be played.  A value of "default" in the mode attribute indicates that the timing will be specified by the widget description, an attribute value of "timeout" will
use the duration specified in the "time" attribute (in seconds), and the value of "cooperative" will display the widget until the user explicitly commands it to stop through a UI element, or the widget itself indicates that it wishes to discontinue
operation.  The presence of a "received" node indicates that the widget instance has been "sent" by a buddy.  The value of the "accepted" attribute indicates whether or not the widget instance has been accepted by the recipient, which is done either
through the web interface or through the UI of the device.  The "forward" attribute indicates whether this widget instance can be sent on to another user.
<br/><br/> If the requested parameters do not exist, a default widget instance is attempted to be retrieved from the system database 712 (stage 1224).  If such a widget instance exists (stage 1228), the service provider 106 responds with an XML-based
parameters message that is processed by the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 upon receipt (stage 1220).  If such a default widget instance does not exist, an error message is returned to the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 (stage 1232).
<br/><br/> Examples of Widget Download
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 18, a signal flow diagram 2700 is provided which illustratively represents the process of downloading the code for a widget (e.g., a .swf file) from the service provider 106 for execution on a CHUMBY.TM.  device 102.  The
process is initiated when the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 sends an HTTP GET request containing the GUID of the requested widget to a specific widget description object within the system database 712 maintained by the service provider 106 (stage 1302).  An
example of such a request is provided below:
<br/><br/> http://server.chumby.com/xml/widgets/BF4CE814-DFB8-11DA-9C82-00306555C864
<br/><br/> The service provider 106 receives the request (stage 2704), and attempts to retrieve the requested widget description from the system database 712 or other data source available to the service provider 106 (stage 2708).  If the requested widget
description is able to be retrieved, the service provider 106 responds with an XML-based widget description message; if not, the service provider 106 responds with an XML-based error message (stage 2712).  An exemplary XML-based response generated by the
service provider 106 is given below:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00008 &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;widget id="BF4CE814-DFB8-11DA-9C82-00306555C864"&gt; &lt;name&gt;Time Zones&lt;/name&gt; &lt;description&gt;A time zone selector&lt;/description&gt;

<br/><br/> Once the requested widget description is received by the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102, the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 uses the URL referencing the "movie" for the requested widget to download the movie (e.g., .swf) file from the service provider 106.  The
CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 sends an HTTP GET request containing the GUID of the requested movie to a specific movie object within the system database 712 maintained by the service provider 106 (stage 1320).  An example of such a request is provided below:
<br/><br/> http://server.chumby.com/xml/movies/BF4CE814-DFB8-11DA-9C82-00306555C864
<br/><br/> The service provider 106 receives the request (stage 2724), and attempts to retrieve the requested movie from the system database 712 or other data source available to the service provider 106 (stage 2728).  If the requested movie is able to be
retrieved, the service provider 106 responds with the .swf file which implements the movie; if not, the service provider 106 responds with an XML-based error message (stage 2732).  Once the requested movie is received by the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102, it is
loaded by the Master Controller and queued for subsequent execution (stage 2736).  If an error is instead received, it is processed accordingly (stage 2740).
<br/><br/> Requesting Content
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 11, a signal flow diagram 1300 is provided which illustratively represents the process of obtaining content from the service provider 106 for a widget of a CHUMBY.TM.  device 102.  The process is initiated when the
CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 sends an HTTP GET and an optional XML request to a specific content object within the system database 712 maintained by the service provider 106 (stage 1302).  An example of such a request for content for a "tide" widget is
provided below: http://content.chumby.com/tides/United%20States/National%20City%- 2C%20San%20Diego %20Bay%2C%20California
<br/><br/> The service provider 106 receives the request (stage 1304), and attempts to retrieve the requested content from the system database 712, internal content service, external content service or other data source available to the service provider
106 (stage 1308).  If the requested content is able to be retrieved, the service provider 106 responds with an XML-based content message; if not, the service provider 106 responds with an XML-based error message (stage 1312).  Once the requested content
is received by the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102, corresponding audiovisual output is generated by the device 102 for the benefit of its user (stage 1316).  If an error is instead received, it is processed accordingly (stage 1320).  An exemplary XML-based
response generated by the service provider 106 is given below:
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00009 &lt;tideitems&gt; &lt;tideitem timestamp="2006-05-31T00:39:11Z"&gt; &lt;location&gt; &lt;locationstring string="National City, San Diego Bay, California"/&gt; &lt;station id="National City, San Diego Bay"/&gt; &lt;state

<br/><br/> In the case where content is retrieved directly from an external content service provider (i.e., from other than the service provider 106), a series of web-based transactions (most likely HTTP and/or XML-based) defined by such content service
provider will take place between the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 and such provider.
<br/><br/>CHUMBY.TM.  Security Protocol
<br/><br/> CHUMBY.TM.  devices 102 may optionally include a hardware security module, which in one implementation is accessed via a character driver interface in the operating system ("OS") of the device 102.  The module may or may not be installed.  When
the module is not installed, the OS preferably virtualizes the hardware security module by emulating it in software.  While losing all the tamper-resistance benefits of a hardware module, this feature enables cost reduction savings while maintaining
protocol interoperability with a secured system.
<br/><br/> The hardware security module of a CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 may be implemented in a number of ways.  As an example, the hardware security module may be implemented using a monolithic security processor or a cryptographic Smart Card module.  This
module, or its emulated counterpart, is capable of at a minimum, the following operations: (1) storage of secret numbers in hardware; (2) the ability to compute public-key signatures; (3) the ability to compute one-way cryptographic hashes; and (4) the
ability to generate trusted random numbers.
<br/><br/> During the manufacturing process the hardware security module, or its emulated counterpart, is initialized with a set of secret numbers that are only known to the module and to the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider 106.  These secret numbers may or
may not consist of public and private keys.  If the numbers consist of public and private keys, then a mutual key-pair is stored by both the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider 106 and the hardware module, along with a putative, insecure identifier number for
the pair.  Furthermore, these numbers are preferably not recorded by the CHUMBY.TM.  service provider 106 in association with any other identifying information, such as the MAC address for the WLAN interface, or any other serial numbers that are stored
in insecure memory for customer service purposes.
<br/><br/> When the user or service wishes to initiate a strong authenticated transaction, the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 sends the putative insecure key-pair identifier to the service provider 106.  The service provider 106 looks up the putative insecure
key-pair identifier and issues a challenge to the hardware module, consisting of a random number In particular, the challenge is packetized and sent through the Internet to the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102.  The device 102 unpacks the challenge and passes it
directly to the hardware module.  The hardware module adds another random number to the packet and signs the pair of numbers, along with other transaction information (such as the version number of the protocol) with a private key that is only known to
the CHUMBY cryptoprocessor.  In addition, an "owner key" may optionally be encrypted to the server public key.  Again, this message is packetized and transmitted by the device 102 to the service provider 106 over the Internet.  Upon receipt, the service
provider 106 verifies the signature of the packet using the device's public key, which was generated and recorded at the time of manufacture and indexed by the hash of the putative insecure key-pair identifier.  The CHUMBY device is deemed authentic if
the signature is correct and the signed packet contains the exact random number that was generated by the service provider in the first step of the challenge.  The service provide 106 also decrypts the owner key, whose purpose is discussed in the next
paragraph.  At the conclusion of this transaction, the service provider 106 has authenticated the device 102, and can fall back to any number of session keys that can be either dynamically generated or statically stored for further secured transactions. 
Advantageously, this authentication transaction does not involve uniquely associating the hardware module with user information.  Rather, the service provider 106 is simply aware of the existence of the approved hardware module and upon completion of the
authentication transaction may safely trust the integrity of the secrets stored therein.
<br/><br/> The owner key comprises a random number (or one of a set of random numbers) generated at the time of manufacture and stored only within the cryptographic processor.  The owner key is transmitted to the server, encrypted using the server public
key, and used as a shared secret to protect any other secrets (user passwords, credit card information, etc.) that may be stored on the server.  Once a user decides they no longer wish to continue with the service, or desire to sell or transfer their
CHUMBY.TM.  device, or otherwise wish to revoke any secrets entrusted to the server, the user can instruct the cryptographic processor to delete the key from memory, thereby abolishing the server's ability to decrypt the secrets entrusted to it.
<br/><br/> A user of the device 102 may opt-out of privacy mode and provide identifying information, as required by some billing services such as credit cards and banks.  Optionally, an anonymous cash-based transaction network can be established where
accounts are opened and managed only by secrets contained within the hardware module.
<br/><br/> To enable limited revocation of user-identifying information, the specific embodiment of the master authentication protocol should operate on a set of clean-room servers with a multiplicity of connections that are trusted by the CHUMBY.TM. 
service provider 106, and authenticated session keys are then passed on laterally to the content servers.  Thus, the anonymity of the master authentication key is nominally preserved, although it is possible to recreate and correlate transactions from
forensic logs and transaction timings.  The use of multiple servers and multiple connections, along with network routing randomization techniques, can be used to increase the anonymization resistance to forensic logging (cf.  Tor network), but this
configuration is in no way essential to the network's operation.
<br/><br/> Example CHUMBY.TM.  Device Calibration, Registration and Account Management
<br/><br/> Attention is now directed to FIGS. 14-21, which are a set of flowcharts representative of the calibration, registration and initial operation of a CHUMBY.TM.  device and associated account management functions.
<br/><br/> Initial Power-Up
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 is a flowchart 1400 which depicts an exemplary sequence of operations performed by a CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 upon initial power-up.  When a user initially connects a CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 to a power source, the device 102 undergoes a
touchscreen calibration process described below with reference to FIGS. 15-16 (stage 1404).  The device 102 then selects a wireless base station in the manner described below with reference to FIG. 17 (stage 1408).  If a proxy server is identified (stage
1412), then information relating to the proxy server is configured into the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 to enable it to with the Web site maintained by the service provider 106 (as well as with the Web sites of content providers) (stage 1416).  At this point
the user of the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 is prompted to set the time zone in which the device 102 is located (stage 1420).  If an NTP server is determined to be available (stage 1430), then time is set automatically based upon information acquired from
such a server (stage 1440).  If not, the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 is referenced to a time set manually (stage 1444).  After the time of the CHUMBY.TM.  device 102 has been set, the registration process described below with reference to FIG. 18 is initiated
(stage 1450).
<br/><br/> In one embodiment a CHUMBY.TM.  device downloads configuration information from the service provider 106 each time it is powered on or otherwise re-establishes communication with the service provider 106.  However, a minimal amount of widget and
configuration information may be locally stored on a CHUMBY.TM.  device so that it may continue to function in the absence of network connectivity.  For example, a clock widget may be permanently stored on a CHUMBY.TM.  device so that its clock function
could remain operational at all times.  A CHUMBY.TM.  device will typically include sufficient memory capacity to hold configuration information received from the service provider 106 for all of the widgets to be executed by the device, up to some
reasonable number of widgets.  If a user changes the configuration for a CHUMBY.TM.  device through the Web site maintained by the service provider 106, a polling function implemented on the corresponding CHUMBY.TM.  device will typically be used to
"pull" the modified configuration information from the service provider 106.  Alternatively, an operation may be manually initiated via the interface of the corresponding CHUMBY.TM.  device in order to obtain this information (e.g., an "Update My
CHUMBY.TM.  Device Now" operation).
<br/><br/> Example Widget Selection, Removal and Configuration
<br/><br/> Attention is now directed to FIGS. 13-16, 20 and 21, which are a set of flowcharts representative of Web-based widget selection, removal and configuration processes contemplated by embodiments of the present invention.  Screen shots of exemplary
user interfaces presented by the Web browser 122 or, alternatively, the screen 320 of the applicable CHUMBY.TM.  personal audiovisual device 102, which are used to facilitate certain of these processes are illustrated in FIG. 17.
<br/><br/> Overview of Widget Management Process
<br/><br/> Turning now to FIG. 13, a top-level flowchart 2200 is provided of exemplary Web-based interaction occurring between a device user and the service provider 106 with regard to adding, removing and configuring widget profiles relative to the user's
CHUMBY.TM.  device.  Alternatively, this interaction between a device user and the service provider 106 may be effected through user interface screens presented by the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device in lieu of the Web browser 122.  Although a user may have
the impression that a CHUMBY.TM.  device itself is being configured through the process of FIG. 13, in the exemplary embodiment a profile currently assigned to the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device is instead configured.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 13, the user logs in to the user's account maintained with the service provider 106 via a Web browser 122 (stage 2202) and proceeds to the user's "home page" or the equivalent (stage 2204).  From this home page the user selects
a "Set Up" device tab or the like (stage 2208) and the Web browser 122 presents a corresponding "Set Up" page (stage 2210).  The user then selects the CHUMBY.TM.  device profile to be configured from a list based upon either the device's serial number or
description (stage 2212).  The current configuration for the selected device profile is then retrieved from the system database 712 and loaded into the device (stage 2216).  Once this has occurred the user selects an action to be performed, as is
illustrated by FIG. 17A (stage 2220).  Such actions may include, for example, adding, deleting or editing widget profiles.  If the user opts to add widget profiles (stage 2224), then the Web browser 122 displays an "Add Widgets Page" through which widget
profiles may be added to the current configuration of the applicable CHUMBY.TM.  device in the manner described below with reference to FIG. 14 (stage 2228).  If the user instead chooses to delete widget profiles from such current configuration (stage
2232), then a "Delete Widgets Page" is presented through which the deletion operation may be completed consistent with the approach described below with reference to FIG. 15 (stage 2236).  Alternatively, the user may select another CHUMBY.TM.  device
profile to configure (stage 2240), or simply exit and return to the user's home page (stage 2244).
<br/><br/> Turning now to FIG. 20, an alternate top-level flowchart 3700 is provided of exemplary Web-based interaction occurring between a device user and the service provider 106 with regard to adding, removing and configuring widget profiles relative to
the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device.  Although a user may have the impression that a CHUMBY.TM.  device itself is being configured through the process of FIG. 20, in the exemplary embodiment a profile currently assigned to the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device is
instead configured.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 20, the user logs in to the user's account maintained with the service provider 106 via a Web browser 122 (stage 3702) and proceeds to the user's "MY CHUMBY.TM.  page" or the equivalent, as is illustrated by FIG. 22A (stage
3704).  From this MY CHUMBY.TM.  page the user optionally selects the CHUMBY.TM.  device to be configured from a list or the like, as is illustrated by FIG. 22B (stage 3706) and the Web browser 122 loads the currently configured widget channel into the
current page (stage 3708).  The user then optionally selects the CHUMBY.TM.  widget channel to be configured from a list or the like, as is illustrated by FIG. 22C (stage 3710).  The current channel configuration for the selected CHUMBY.TM.  device is
then updated in the system database 712, loaded into the current page (stage 3712) and loaded by the currently selected CHUMBY.TM.  device (stage 3713).  At any point the user may select the "Edit Channel" option (stage 3714), following which a "Edit
Channel Page" is presented, as is illustrated by FIG. 22D (stage 3716), with the widget configuration for the selected channel is loaded into the page (stage 3718).  Once this has occurred, the user may select an action to be performed (stage 3720). 
Such actions may include, for example, changing, renaming, deleting or creating new widget channels; adding widgets to, removing widgets from, changing playback order of widgets within or configuring widgets within the selected channel.  If the user opts
to perform a widget action (stage 3724), then the widget instance for the affected widget and/or the configuration for the selected channel within the system database 712 are updated, which subsequently effects a corresponding update to the local copy of
the channel configuration of all CHUMBY.TM.  devices currently "playing" the selected channel (stage 3728).  If the user opts to perform a channel action (stage 3732), then the configuration for the selected channel within the system database 712 is
updated which subsequently effects a corresponding update to the local copy of the channel configuration of all CHUMBY.TM.  devices currently "playing" the selected channel (stage 3734).  Alternatively, the user may select another channel to configure
(stage 3740), or navigate to another page (stages 3742, 3744).
<br/><br/> Adding Widgets
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 is a flowchart 2300 representative of exemplary Web-based interaction occurring between a device user and the service provider 106 with respect to the addition of widgets to the current configuration of the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device. 
Alternatively, this interaction between a device user and the service provider 106 may be effected through user interface screens presented by the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device in lieu of the Web browser 122.  In one embodiment the user is provided with the
opportunity to choose, through an appropriate category selection page (see, e.g., FIG. 17B) presented by a Web browser 122, among various widget categories retrieved from the categories table of the system database 712 (stage 2302).  After selecting a
widget category (stage 2304), both the widgets included within the selected category and the current widget configuration of the applicable CHUMBY.TM.  device are presented to the user (stage 2308).  The user then selects an action to perform (stage
2312) including, for example, exiting the widget addition process (stage 2316) or navigating the list of widgets presented for the selected category (stage 2320).  If the latter action is selected (see, e.g., FIGS. 17C-17D), the user then selects a
widget to be added to the current configuration (e.g., by selecting a corresponding icon) and the service provider 106 constructs an instance of the selected widget (stage 2324).  At this point the user may also opt to add yet more widgets to the current
configuration (stage 2328).  Once the user has indicated that no additional widgets are to be added, a widget configuration phase (stage 2332) may be entered (see, e.g., FIG. 17E).  If the user declines to select a widget while navigating the list of
widgets presented for a selected category during stage 2320, a new category of widgets may be selected (stage 2340).
<br/><br/> If the user decides to exit the process of adding widgets to the current configuration, the user may perform one of several actions, including, but not limited to: select another CHUMBY.TM.  device to configure; navigate to another page on the
CHUMBY.TM.  site; log out from the CHUMBY.TM.  site; or close the applicable browser window (stage 2316).  If the user instead chooses to save the current widget configuration for the applicable CHUMBY.TM.  device (stage 2350), the user selects a
"Submit", "Commit", "Ok" or similar button to cause any changes made to be recorded in the system database 712 (stage 2354).  After either saving the current widget configuration or electing to exit the process, the user may be directed to a predefined
page (stage 2360).
<br/><br/> FIG. 21 is an alternate flowchart 3800 representative of exemplary Web-based interaction occurring between a device user and the service provider 106 with respect to the addition of widgets to a channel configuration.  In one embodiment the user
is provided with the opportunity to choose, through an appropriate category selection list on the EDIT CHANNEL Page (see, e.g., FIG. 22D) presented by a Web browser 122, among various widget categories retrieved from the categories table of the system
database 712 (stage 3802).  After selecting a widget category (stage 3804), the widgets included within the selected category are presented to the user, as is illustrated by FIG. 22F (stage 3808).  The user then selects an action to perform including,
for example, navigating to another page (stage 3832) or navigating the list of widgets presented for the selected category (stage 3812).  If the latter action is selected (see, e.g., FIG. 22G), the user then selects a widget to be added to the current
configuration by selecting a widget from the "widgets" list (stage 3816), which causes the selected widget to be displayed (stage 3820), and then selecting the ADD TO CHANNEL button (stage 3824), which causes the service provider 106 to construct an
instance of the selected widget and update the configuration for the current channel in the system database 712 (stage 3828).  At this point the user may also opt to iteratively navigate the widget list (stage 3812), select widgets (stage 3816) and add
more widgets to the current configuration (stage 3824).  At any time in this process, other widget and/or channel operations may be selected and/or executed by the user (stage 3840), including, but not limited to: configuring a widget instance (see,
e.g., FIG. 22H), a widget deletion, altering widget playback ordering within the channel, renaming the current channel, deleting the current channel, creating a new channel and/or selecting a new category of widgets may be selected (stage 3850).
<br/><br/> If the user decides to exit the process of adding widgets to the current configuration, the user may perform one of several actions, including, but not limited to: select another channel to configure, as is illustrated by FIG. 22E; navigate to
another page on the CHUMBY.TM.  site (stage 3832); log out from the CHUMBY.TM.  site; or close the applicable browser window.
<br/><br/> Widget Removal
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 15, a flowchart 2400 is provided which is representative of exemplary Web-based interaction occurring between a device user and the service provider 106 in connection with the removal of widgets from the current
configuration of the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device.  Alternatively, this interaction between a device user and the service provider 106 may be effected through user interface screens presented by the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device in lieu of the Web browser 122. 
Upon being presented with the "EDIT CHANNEL Page", as is illustrated by FIG. 22D (stage 2402), the user may elect to either de-activate a selected widget (stage 2406), delete (or remove) a selected widget (stage 2410), or select some other widget,
channel and/or page navigation operation (stage 2414).  If widget de-activation is chosen, the user is prompted to confirm the choice (stage 2418).  Once such confirmation has been provided the widget is marked as "inactive" on the page currently being
rendered by the Web browser 122 (stage 2420).  In addition, the widget instance configuration for the selected channel is updated within the system database 712 (stage 2424) and any CHUMBY.TM.  devices currently displaying the selected channel are
updated.  Similarly, if it is instead chosen to delete the selected widget, the user is optionally prompted to confirm the choice (stage 2438).  Once the widget is deleted or after optionally required confirmation has been provided, the widget is removed
from the page currently being rendered by the Web browser 122 (stage 2440), the widget instance is "deleted" from the channel configuration in the system database 712 (stage 2424) and any CHUMBY.TM.  devices currently displaying the selected channel are
updated.  If confirmation to de-activate or delete the selected widget is required, but not provided (stages 2418 and 2438), the operation is aborted.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 24, an alternate flowchart 4100 is provided which is representative of exemplary interaction occurring, via the CHUMBY.TM.  device of a user, between such user and the service provider 106 in connection with the removal of
widgets from the current configuration of the user's CHUMBY.TM.  device.  With a widget displayed on the screen 320 of the CHUMBY.TM.  device (stage 4102), the user performs the gesture which selects the Control Panel (stage 4104).  Upon being presented
with the Control Panel, as is illustrated by FIG. 23A (stage 4108), which displays the avatar for the current widget (stage 4112), the user may optionally use the widget navigation controls to singly or iteratively select a new current widget (stage
4116), in which case the new current widget is loaded (stage 4120) and its avatar displayed (stage 4112).  The user may then elect to delete (or remove) the current widget by selecting DELETE (stage 4124).  If widget deletion is chosen, the user is
prompted to confirm the choice, as is illustrated by FIG. 23B (stage 4128).  If the user confirms the deletion (stage 4132), the widget instance is deleted from the channel on the CHUMBY.TM.  device and the widget instance is "deleted" from the channel
configuration in the system database 712 (stage 4136).  If confirmation is not provided, the operation is aborted.  At this point, the delete confirmation screen is exited (stage 4140) and the Control Panel is displayed.  The user has the option to
select HIDE CONTROL PANEL (stage 4144), which exits the control panel and resumes normal widget play.
<br/><br/> Widget Configuration
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 is a flowchart 2500 depicting an exemplary set of operations involved in configuring parameters specific to of one or more widgets currently associated with a given CHUMBY.TM.  device.  The process is initiated by accessing the
configuration of a selected widget instance maintained within the system database (stage 2502).  An appropriate user interface through which the existing configuration of the selected widget may be edited is then generated based upon such existing
configuration (stage 2504).  This may involve, for example, establishing various inter-field dependencies based upon the existing configuration (stage 2508).  Once the user interface has been generated it is presented to the user via a Web browser 122 in
order to enable desired changes to the configuration to be made, as is illustrated by FIG. 22H (stage 2512).  If a user elects to edit one or more fields presented by the interface (2516), the user interface defining the widget configuration is
correspondingly changed (stage 2520).  If a user elects to not edit any of these fields, the user is given the option of selecting a "default configuration" (stage 2524).  To the extent this option is selected, all fields are reset to default values
(stage 2528); otherwise, the user is given the option to exit the process or return to stage 2516 (stage 2540).  When the process is exited, the user is given the option of saving the edited version of the configuration in the system database 712 (stage
2544).  If this option is selected, the current widget configuration is saved to the database 712 (stage 2550).  The "Edit Channel Page" is then presented to the user, irrespective of whether or not the user elected to save the widget configuration
(stage 2560).
<br/><br/> In an exemplary embodiment the service provider 106 populates a corresponding widget and parameters tables within the system database in accordance with the user's parameter selections.  In this regard the widget table may include an XML-based
"param_desc_xml" field containing instructions enabling the construction of associated records in parameters table.  For example, for a "clock" widget the XML-based instructions could indicate that a time zone should be a valid parameter, and could also
be utilized to create appropriate records in the parameters table.
<br/><br/>Distribution of Electronic Greetings Among CHUMBY.TM.  Devices
<br/><br/> Users of CHUMBY.TM.  devices may be provided with an interface to allow to facilitate sending electronic greeting cards in the form of rich Flash animations.  Upon visiting a predefined web site (e.g., http://greetings.chumby.com) and optionally
being authenticated by presenting appropriate credentials, a user will be presented with a catalog of "CHUMBY.TM.  Greetings".  In one embodiment access to certain "CHUMBY.TM.  Greetings" may be dependent on membership status.  Any authenticated user,
irrespective of the number of registered CHUMBY.TM.  devices, will have the permission to send CHUMBY.TM.  Greetings to one or more arbitrary email addresses or, alternatively, one or more users registered with the CHUMBY.TM.  network.  If a visitor to
the web site is aware of the globally and temporally unique email address of an existing CHUMBY.TM.  device, the account name in which the CHUMBY.TM.  device is registered, or other means of identifying individual CHUMBY.TM.  devices, they may specify
CHUMBY.TM.  Greetings to be forwarded directly to such a device using the existing widget transfer infrastructure of the service provider 106.  Upon receipt at the CHUMBY.TM.  device, the transferred CHUMBY.TM.  Greetings will be added to the channel or
profile in which the recipient has designated for receipt of widgets or other delivered content.  Once the widget has been delivered to a channel or profile, the recipient will have the option of accepting or rejecting the delivered content.  In the
event that a user accepts the CHUMBY.TM., the CHUMBY.TM.  Greeting will be added to the recipient's widget slideshow rotation in accordance with the applicable profile of the device.  In one example, a visitor to the web site may choose to assign a
certain level of priority to a CHUMBY.TM.  Greeting such that it may be displayed by the recipient CHUMBY.TM.  device immediately following actuation of the device's alarm function.  Alternatively, a priority assigned to a CHUMBY.TM.  Greeting may define
the placement of the CHUMBY.TM.  Greeting in the recipient's widget rotation.
<br/><br/> CHUMBY.TM.  Greetings sent to email addresses that are not bound to physical CHUMBY.TM.  devices will be forwarded as an SMTP email message.  This message will originate from, for example, "greetings@chumby.com" (or a user supplied email
address), and will contain a URL or hyperlink pointing to a temporary web page hosting the Flash movie comprising the CHUMBY.TM.  Greeting in addition to an optional user-defined message.  Authenticated users will have the ability to select one or more
peers from their CHUMBY.TM.  "Buddy List" as recipients of a preconfigured CHUMBY.TM.  Greeting.  In one embodiment of CHUMBY.TM.  Greetings, a subscription may be required for access to certain features such as CHUMBY.TM.  Greetings.  In such an
embodiment, users subscribing to the CHUMBY.TM.  Network will have access to "premium" CHUMBY.TM.  Greetings.  In one embodiment, CHUMBY.TM.  may wish to elect a "pay-per-view" model where the use of a "premium" CHUMBY.TM.  Greetings may be charged as a
micro-transaction.  In one embodiment, CHUMBY.TM.  Greeting recipients that are not bound to physical CHUMBY.TM.  devices will be presented with an option to forward the CHUMBY.TM.  Greeting to alternate email addresses or physical CHUMBY.TM.  devices.
<br/><br/> CHUMBY.TM.  Channels
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments profiles pertinent to various specialty interests or activities (e.g., sports, cooking) may be developed and maintained by the service provider 106 or other users of CHUMBY.TM.  devices.  Each such profile, or "channel",
could be subscribed to by interested users of CHUMBY.TM.  devices.  This may be considered a special case of mirroring to a "virtual" CHUMBY.TM.  device as described above, but would further involve effort on the part of the "owners" of each channel to
keep its widget set and other content updated.  Channels could somewhat broadly focus upon a particular subject (e.g., recipes, football), or could be more specific in nature (e.g., vegetarian recipes, NFL football).
<br/><br/>Overview of CHUMBY.TM.  Cloud Services for CHUMBY.TM.-Enabled Clients
<br/><br/> FIGS. 25-28 illustrate an exemplary manner in which Internet-based cloud services and content may be delivered to a variety of Internet-connected, CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices.  As is discussed below, each CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device
may be configured with CHUMBY.TM.  client software capable of executing widgets provided via an Internet-based central service provider.  The service provider typically stores a repository of widgets and has access to other content capable of being
communicated to a given CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device.  A wide range of consumer electronics devices may potentially be configured as CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices including, for example, digital photo frames, Internet-connected televisions,
CHUMBY.TM.  devices (see, e.g., FIGS. 1-4), Internet radios, Internet tablets, Blu-Ray players, VOIP phones and videogame consoles.  It is a feature of embodiments of the invention that all of these devices can be registered against a single user account
and share the same widgets, content and configuration; thereby providing a consistent, easy-to-use, rich media Internet user experience.
<br/><br/> The CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices may typically be configured either through a user computer (not shown) disposed for communication with the service provider or directly through the user interfaces of such client devices.  When a user
computer is utilized, a user may configured one or more CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices through interaction with a Web browser displaying pages generated by the central service provider.  As mentioned above, such configuration may include, for example,
specifying a set of widgets (i.e., small, Flash-based applications which present content, media, services and the like to the user via a CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device) to be sent to a particular CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device and their sequence of
execution.  Such configuration may further include adjusting audio or visual parameters relating to such execution, defining and managing a user's CHUMBY.TM.  network, and defining the layout or other aspects of the user interface presented through the
screen of the CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment each CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device includes an Open Source software stack built on a Linux core.  Services and utilities such as btplay, httpd, zeroconf and DLNA plug into the Linux core.  Adobe Flash Lite 3.x is used as the
presentation and content/media rendering layer enabling the chumby network and CHUMBY.TM.  widgets to provide a flexible, adaptable rich media experience to users or CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices.  With the exception of the Adobe Flash component, in
one embodiment the entire CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client software stack is Open Source.  In one embodiment user interface and widget player of each CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device are written entirely in Adobe Flash.  This enables the appearance of the user
interface elements to be easily adapted to various screen sizes, orientations and device types.
<br/><br/> Due to the open nature of the CHUMBY.TM.  client software, it is easily ported to a broad variety of architectures and devices.  In one embodiment a client device requires only a compatible version of Flash and an IP-based connection to the
Internet to be capable of being configured to operate as a CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device.  Although in certain implementations it is preferred that a CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device include a Linux operating system, this is not requirement and it is
possible to port the CHUMBY.TM.  client software to any number of device operating systems including, for example, variants of Microsoft Windows.
<br/><br/> During operation of a CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device, software comprising widgets or other applications is received from the central service provider is stored within memory for execution by the processor of the device.  In one embodiment
widgets are downloaded from the service provider 106 to CHUMBY.TM.  devices in the format of a Flash Lite file, also referred to as a "Flash movie".  The memory of the device also includes a Flash Player for playing the widgets received by the device.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 28, in one embodiment the CHUMBY.TM.  cloud services are delivered through a web-based application (the "CHUMBY.TM.  network application") that runs on redundant, load balanced, Linux-based Sun servers.  The data layer may be
implemented on a MySQL cluster and the application, presentation and services layers may be implemented in Ruby on Rails.
<br/><br/> As is described hereinafter, the CHUMBY.TM.  network may be configured to provide at least the following services.
<br/><br/> 1.  A user-facing web site at, for example, www.chumby.com, which provides an intuitive, easy to use interface for CHUMBY.TM.  users to activate, manage and configure all of their CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices; manage and configure their
CHUMBY.TM.  widgets and channels ("playlists" of widgets); and manage their CHUMBY.TM.  social network of friends and family ("chums").  The CHUMBY.TM.  web site may also supports the open platform developer community through developer mini-sites for
widget, software and hardware development.
<br/><br/> 2.  An XML-based web services API which the supports the activation, management, configuration, operation of and widget delivery to all CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices.  All CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices activated on the CHUMBY.TM. 
network preferably retrieve their configurations and widgets via the CHUMBY.TM.  network.  Software updates for CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices are also managed via the CHUMBY.TM.  network.  When a new update is available for a user's
CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device, the user is notified and given the option to install the update automatically.
<br/><br/> The CHUMBY.TM.  network provides a one-stop service for users to activate and manage all of their CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices.  Each device is preferably uniquely identified and bound to a single user's CHUMBY.TM.  account.  A user can
activate and manage any number of CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices against a single account or across multiple accounts (but a device can generally only be active in one account at a given time).  This advantageously permits a user to easily get a
newly-acquired CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices up on the CHUMBY.TM.  network running the same widgets as are being executed by the user's existing CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices.  No new account creation, widget configuration or learning curve is
required.
<br/><br/> Because in exemplary embodiments CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices are connected to the Internet and widgets are written in Flash, users of CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices may have access to virtually every type of content available on the
Internet.  Below are various examples of the type of media, content and services potentially available to CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices via the CHUMBY.TM.  network: Audio--streaming Internet music and podcasts from SHOUTcast, Radio Free Chumby, CBS,
Clearchannel, MediaFly, the NY Times and Pandora; music/audio from an iPod; music/audio from USB connected storage; music from your SlimServer; and audio from devices on a LAN via DLNA.  Video--streaming video from content providers such as major TV
networks, YouTube, VideoJug, Avot and JustinTV; video aggregators such as Avot; animation sites such as Anime Network; webcam operators such as Earthcam Networks; and Internet TV providers such as Orb Network.  Video-on-demand, subscription and other pay
for use video services could also be quickly and easily deployed via widgets on the CHUMBY.TM.  network.  News--a broad variety of text, picture, podcast and mixed media news offerings from entities such as, for example, The NY Times, CBS, MTV Networks,
Washington Post, Reuters and other news/media providers.  Weather--live weather updates from The Weather Channel Interactive, NOAA, Accuweather, BBC, Weather Underground and other weather data providers.  Social Networks--widgets from <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter,
Rabble, Friendfeed and other social media service providers could further enable social interaction through CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices.  Games--a broad spectrum of interactive games, some of which support game lobbies to recruit opponents and high
score servers.  Photos--users can see their and their friends' photos on Photobucket, Flickr, Picasa, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> and other photo hosting sites.  In the digital photo frame implementation of the CHUMBY.TM.  interface (described below), users can easily
share photos from their camera, PC or internet with other chumby users in their "chums" network via simple UI gestures like drag and drop, making photo sharing drop-dead-simple Miscellaneous--sports, recipes, auctions, email notification, calendars,
dating, finance, RSS feeds, horoscopes, humor, travel, virtual worlds.
<br/><br/> Widgets for desired content or services can be quickly developed and deployed via the open CHUMBY.TM.  network.  CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices support interactivity, so users can not only watch or listen to content but engage in a variety of
other activities.  Such activities of a user could include, for example (i) interacting with the widgets executed by the user's CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device and related content services delivered therethrough, (ii) sending widgets via the CHUMBY.TM. 
network to their "chums", (iii) replying to their friend requests, (iv) bidding on their auctions, (v) changing the widget "channel" they are watching, (v) engaging in a game with another CHUMBY.TM.  user.
<br/><br/> The CHUMBY.TM.  network also advantageously facilitates various forms of advertising.  As is known, many advertisements delivered via the Internet today have already been developed in Flash.  Since CHUMBY.TM.  widgets may also be implemented in
Flash, it is apparent that CHUMBY.TM.  widgets may easily interface with new or existing ad servers and services to deliver advertisements in widgets (or advertisements that are widgets) via the CHUMBY.TM.  network.  These advertisements may include
images, video, audio or mixed media, and/or requests for interaction such as "touch here for more information", "send me email with details or a coupon/offer code," or "buy now!" Advertisements could take the form of interactive games delivered through
CHUMBY.TM.  widgets.
<br/><br/> Advertisements may also be targeted to CHUMBY.TM.  users/devices based on anonymized demographic information (age, gender, zip code, education level) and psychographic data (widgets played, content viewed, music listened to, day part usage, etc)
to create a highly effective campaign.
<br/><br/> Turning now to FIG. 29, there is shown a screen shot of an exemplary user interface presented by a CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device.  As is indicated by FIG. 29, user selection of a "Widgets" screen button in a left pane of the user interface
results in display of a "Widget Categories" view in a right pane of the user interface.  Similar forms of user interface screens may be presented by CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices to support settings and configurations options for widgets, streaming
audio, and other configurable selections.  Alternatively, hard or soft key buttons on CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices may be utilized to select such setting and configuration options.
<br/><br/> A CHUMBY.TM.  widget is generally configurable in a manner specified by the widget author(s).  Certain widgets will require a user to enter configuration information such as postal code, news type (sports, business, world, etc), account
information or stock ticker symbols before displaying meaningful information.  Other widgets may display default information in the absence of configuration or may not require any configuration whatsoever.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment CHUMBY.TM.  widgets are characterized with respect to a range of hardware characteristics supported or required in connection with the execution of such widgets.  Such characteristics will typically be made visible in the
various widget catalogs which a user may access via the CHUMBY.TM.  web site in connection with selecting widgets for playing on the user's CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device.  A more complete discussion of an exemplary process for characterization,
selection and deployment of widgets suitable for various types of CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices is set forth in Appendix A.
<br/><br/> If a CHUMBY.TM.  widget allows to user to select from one or more information feeds, then the user will have the option to do so.  Numerous widgets may be developed which enable access to feeds for weather, news, sports, comedy, entertainment,
video and audio content.  The user may select to play any or all of these feeds at any time and in any order.
<br/><br/> It is a feature of typical embodiments of the invention that CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices are not required to display a "home page" or similar operational or start-up page.  The author of a CHUMBY.TM.  widget determines the way in which the
content is to be presented to the user upon being rendered by a CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device.  Such content can be text and simple images, video, audio or some other combination of the above.  In various embodiments the user interface of a
CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client device can simultaneously display any number of active widgets, subject only to screen size and resolution constraints.
<br/><br/> CHUMBY.TM.  widgets can be configured to update from feeds or any other data source, API or web services interface at any desired interval.  In one embodiment a user may nonetheless select to play one or more widgets at any time and the selected
widget(s) will play immediately.
<br/><br/> In general, CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices are typically configured to deliver content and media through the use of widgets.  However, this is not a requirement and, for example, services such as streaming audio may be delivered via a
discrete audio subsystem (enabling a user to play music and other audio while widgets are also playing).  In exemplary embodiments widgets comprise individual Flash-based applications capable of retrieving content and media from services and interfaces
on the CHUMBY.TM.  network.  Such content and media may in the form of text (e.g., RSS feeds), images/photos, animations, streaming video, information from commercial Web sites (e.g., eBay auctions), or information from social networks.  In exemplary
embodiments widgets can be built to serve up essentially any type of media or content or service desired.  New widgets are immediately available to users on the CHUMBY.TM.  network when published and updates to existing widgets propagate to the users who
are using them within a matter of minutes.  This framework provides a network operator with the ability to provide a constantly evolving and improving set of applications and services to users CHUMBY.TM.-enabled client devices.

connectivity.
<br/><br/> The widget compatibility may then be provided to a user via a different interface, such as via a web interface provided on a web browser of a user's computer 9535.  This may be done in the form of a display or list of compatible widgets.  A
typical example of widget selections are shown on the web page of Chumby Industries at www.chumby.com which can be accessed from any computer web browser.
<br/><br/> The user may then make a selection of one or more widgets to be provided to the user's device, and the selected widgets may then be provided to the device at stage 9540.  The user's device 9400 may then render the one or more widgets at stage
9550.  Widget rendering may be done as described previously herein.
<br/><br/> Attention is now directed to FIG. 96A, which illustrates a process 9600A that may be used to render a set of widgets on a device such as device 9400.  At stage 9610, a show widget, which references a plurality of items associated with media
content, may be defined.  A sequence of widgets comprising a channel may then be defined, with the show widget being included in sequence of widgets comprising the channel.  The sequence of widgets may then be executed in conjunction with the user
interface, with the media content being rendered upon execution of the show widget.  In one implementation, one or more of the plurality of items is a digital photo album, with the photos stored in a memory of the device, such as memory 9420.
<br/><br/> In one implementation, a first photo album of digital photos may be stored in the memory 9420 of the device, and a second album may be stored remotely, such as on server system 9480 or on another site, such as online photo sites Photobucket or
Flicker.
<br/><br/> Alternately and/or in addition, media content items may be video content in the form of video files, audio content, or other types of content.  These may be stored locally or remotely.  Remotely stored content may be Internet-accessible photo,
audio and/or video content, such as may be available on web sites such as <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> YouTube, MySpace or other online sites configured to store media content.
<br/><br/> Modules for implementing various versions of process 9600A may be stored on a medium, such as medium 9420B as shown in FIG. 94C.
<br/><br/> Attention is now directed to FIG. 96B, which illustrates one method of user operation of an electronic device, such as a picture frame device 9400, to provide local and remotely stored content, such as photos stored in a plurality of digital
photo albums.  At stage 9640, a user may define a first album of first digital media content that is stored within a local memory of device 9400.  At stage 9650 a user may define a second album of content that is accessible from a remote server system,
such as from system 9480 (or another remote server system).  At stage 9670, a show widget may be defined or selected, with the show widget including or referencing the first album and said second album and/or the associated content.  The show widget may
then be executed, with the user interface of device 9400 rendering the first digital media content and the second digital media content.  As noted previously, memory 9420 may include memory stored in device 9400 as well as memory in the form of an
external memory card or other plug-in memory device.  In some implementations, the local memory stored media content may be stored on the memory card or other memory device.  Alternately or in addition, other locally accessible memory, such as memory
accessible via a local area network (LAN) or other local network may store the digital media content.
<br/><br/> In various implementations, multiple sets of widgets may be provided to device 9400 in the form of different channels, such as is described previously herein.  In one implementation, a user may device an album widget including media content
stored in the local memory 9400, and an additional album widget associated with remotely accessible content.  These widgets may be included in a plurality of channels provided to the device 9400.
<br/><br/> Attention is now directed to FIG. 97, which illustrates a process 9700 for associating widgets with albums.  At stage 9710, a first album widget may be defined in response to a user input, where the user input may be received through a user
interface of the portable electronic device.  The first album widget may include and/or may be associated with a first set of digital media content stored within a local memory of the device.  The local memory may be internal to the device and/or may be
in a removable device such as a compact flash or other type of memory card.  At stage 9720, a second album widget may be defined and associated with a second set of digital media content located remotely from the device.  The content may be accessible
from a remote server.  At stage 9730, the first album widget may be added to a first channel, where the first channel includes a sequence of widgets executable by the device.  At stage 9740, the second album widget may be added to a second channel, with
the second channel including a second sequence of widgets.  Widgets included in one or both of these channels may then be executed on the device.
<br/><br/> In rendering the widgets on the device, widgets included in one or both of the channels may reference for playback audio files, images or photos, video files or combinations of these.  This content may be stored either on the device or
referenced to an external storage, such as an external website server or database.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, a service provider and associated system may be used to provide widget and/or content sharing functionality.  This may be done by a first user sending a request to the service provider to send media and/or widgets to a
second user, such as a chum.
<br/><br/> FIG. 98A illustrates an embodiment of a process to facilitate sharing widgets.  At stage 9810 a service provider receives a request to send content to another user.  The service provider then receives the content at stage 9820 and uploads the
content to a server, such as a server in system 9480 as shown in FIG. 94A.  At stage 9830, a widget may be created so as to correspond or be associated with the content.  The widget may include information referencing the network server so as to
facilitate later content download by the second user's device.  At stage 9840, the created widget may be sent to the second user.  Upon receipt, the widget and associated content may be played/rendered on the second user's device and/or a request or
control may be provided to verify the second user's authorization to play the widget and/or render the content.  In addition, widgets may be used to control playback or rendering of content based on configuration information, such as hardware information
associated with the second user's device.
<br/><br/> In one example, the content may be in the form of a slideshow, with the photos stored on the server and the slideshow rendered on the second user's device in response the first user's transmission of a request to send the content.  One or more
digital photos may be selected for playback, and these may be selected from a digital photo library on the second user's device and/or on the server.  A user interface may be provided on the service provider's site to allow the first user and/or the
second user to select photos for rendering.  This may use a drag-and-drop interface to facilitate fast selection of photos for rendering.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, a first user may be allowed to send an invitation to a second user, such as a chum, to receive content.  An example embodiment of a process 9800B to implement this is shown in FIG. 98B.  At stage 9850, the service provider
receives an invitation from a first user to establish an association with a second user, such as a chum.  At stage 9860, an invitation is sent to a device associated with the second user.  If the second user chooses to accept, he may send an acceptance,
which is received at stage 9870.  After receipt, the service provider may then send a widget to facilitate connection to the second user.  The widget may be generated in response to information provided by the first system user to the one of the
plurality of personal electronic devices where the device is capable of executing the instance of the widget.
<br/><br/> The first user may also be provided with an interface to facilitate sending digital media content to the second user, and the digital media content may be uploaded to the service provider, such as at a web site of the service provider.  This may
be done as was described previously with respect to FIG. 98A.
<br/><br/> The service provider will typically allow invitations to be provided to multiple other user's associated with the first user, and in some cases, transmission of invitations may be automated based on, for example, contact information, address
books, or other information provided from the first user.  The service provider may also provide an interface to allow display of a profile or other information associated with the first user as well as other users.  The profile may include information
associated with widgets that are available from different users.  This may be based on an associative relationship established between multiple users.  Profile information may also facilitate a display of widgets and/or associated content that are
capable of being rendered on particular user's device or devices.

<br/><br/> My Chums Options--List of user's chums: Name; Invitations; Invite someone to be a Chum; Invite people who have accounts in network; Search profiles; Username; Last name; Invite by username, last name, email.
<br/><br/> What is shown as part of search results?
<br/><br/> Requester must have account and be logged in. Invite with email address (might be out of network).  Import email addresses from Webmail accounts.  Enter email address.  Email will contain link to take them to site where they can log in or create
an account.  When they log in they will be taken to an "accept invite" area.  What about reminders? Been deleted; Not been deleted.
<br/><br/> What about withdrawing invites? Been deleted; Not been deleted
<br/><br/> View and respond to received invitations; View all pending invitations
<br/><br/> Possible responses--Accept; Accepting an invitation makes relationship bidirectional, Ignore; Deny, with or without notification, deny always deletes from receivers list.
<br/><br/> View status of sent invitations--Accepted status; Option to Delete from history; There should be the ability to cancel a chum relationship
<br/><br/> My Configuration: Set Policy for my profile.  Who can view; What is visible to searches; What they can view as a result of a search; parental settings.
<br/><br/> Where to put received widgets: inbox or designated channel--By sender; Setting presence;
<br/><br/> Availability for interactive sessions: chat, voice, videoOptions for a Selected chum; View selected chums profile; View names of received widgets from selected chum
<br/><br/> View names of sent widgets; Request session: IM; Voice chat
<br/><br/> Camera; View Presence: Available, not available
<br/><br/> Sending Widgets--Sending process to a chum.  Widgets from a channel or catalog, slideshows and collections of photos can be sent.  Photos and videos are uploaded to designated upload site when the widget is sent.  The widget points to the media
on the photo sharing site.  A collection of photos are automatically made into a slideshow widget when sending.  (So you can drag `n` drop a collection of photos on a chum).  Users will be requested to input a name or provided the option to rename. 
Messages can be created and attached when sending a widget that will be displayed when the widget is played
<br/><br/> Sending process to an email address--Slideshows and collections of photos can be sent to an email address.  Widgets can only be sent to chums.  Photos and videos are uploaded to designated upload site.  An email is sent with the link to the
photos embedded in the email.  Email will contain some chumby promotional content and a link to chumby.com to register but the recipient will not be required to be a registered on the network to view.  Over time the promotional material can get more
dynamic and targeted.  The created message will be embedded in the email.
<br/><br/> Drag `n` Drop rules--Dropping on "Chums" menu; System prompts for target: Email address or chum(s) name; For collection of photos: Prompt for widget name.  For widgets or slideshows: provide rename option.
<br/><br/> Option to attach a message--drop on specific chum; For collection of photos: Prompt for widget name; for widgets or slideshows: provide rename option; Option to attach a message.  User should be required to have a chumby account to view photos. 
When a widget is created to be sent it will be listed in the sent area for a chum but the widget will not be accessible by the sender.  It must be clear to sender that it will not be.  Messages attached to a sent widget are embedded in widget and
displayed by widget
<br/><br/> Sharing and Chum Event Notification--Key events; Receipt of invitation request; Receipt of widget when it automatically appears in channel; Receipt of widget when it is waiting acceptance; New photos are waiting from photosharing site.
<br/><br/> Notification process--Icon is displayed in play window to indicate that there are pending events requiring a response.  On entering control panel the status window will contain the status information and the appropriate navigation to process the
events will be highlighted (like channels is highlighted today indicating that there are widgets awaiting acceptance).
<br/><br/> Examples of Creating Widgets from local Photos and Videos--A collection of local photos and videos can be sent to a chum as a slideshow widget.  The Photos/Video may be sent by dragging and dropping a collection of photos/videos onto the chum
category or a specific chum.  When dropped, the collection is made into a slideshow widget and sent to the destination chum(s).  A CHUMBYframe may provide the capability to have a widget that views local photos as part of a user channel.  For example,
when a collection of local photos and/or videos are drag `n` dropped onto a channel a local slideshow widget is put in the channel that will point to the collection.  The photos are typically not moved for local slideshow widgets, and local slideshow
widgets are typically only usable on the device where the photos are resident.  When sent the local slideshow widgets may follow the same rules as sending a collection of local photos.
<br/><br/> User of Local Slideshow Widgets--Local slideshow widgets ("show widgets") may be created when a user drags `n` drops a local collection of media onto a channel.  The widget will reference local content.  User will have access to the following
local slideshow widgets from the chumby catalog.
<br/><br/> Use of Internal Memory/ALL photos--when played, the "Internal Memory/ALL photos" widget may displays photos from the ALL internal album using the default playing effects.  If there are no photos in the internal memory the widget will display a
quick message saying "No Photos in internal memory."
<br/><br/> Inserted Memory Card/ALL photos--when played, the "Inserted Memory Card/ALL photos" widget will play any photos that are contained on an inserted memory card using the default playing effects.  The widget may be configured to be tolerant of
changing cards, removing cards in the middle, no card being inserted.  If there are no photos in the inserted memory card the widget will display a quick message saying "No Photos in internal memory" If multiple devices are inserted the user will be
asked to define which device to use.
<br/><br/> Use of PC on a LAN/ALL photos--When played, the "PC on a LAN/ALL photos" widget may play any photos that are contained on a discovered networked PC using the default playing effects.  If multiple connected PCs are detected the widget will ask
for the name of the PC to use.  The widget will ask the user to go to a PC and approve the connection if PCs are not enabled.  The widget may be configured to be fault tolerant of connection problems and display, for example, "No photos available".  A
Best of chumby section may be provided to contain the Internal Memory/ALL photos and the Inserted Memory Card/ALL photos widget out of the box.  If users plays "Best of Chumby" they will get their photos intermixed with chumby content.
<br/><br/> Sending Photos/Video as a Slideshow Widget--Photos/Video may be sent to a chum as a slideshow widget by dragging and dropping a collection of photos/videos onto the chum category or a specific chum.  When dropped on the chum category the user
will be presented a modal dialogue that asks to select the destination chum(s).  When dropped on a specific chum the collection will be sent to the specific chum.  When the collection of photos and/or video is located on the client the sent slideshow
widget will reference the specific photos.  If a selected group of photos is sent the widget will reference the specific photos that are selected.  If an album or a favorite is sent the widget will reference the specific contents of the album when the
widget was sent.  The photos may be uploaded to the designated upload site and the sent widget references the photos and contains the appropriate credentials to access the photos.  When a selection of photos is sent from a photosharing site the sent
widget references the photos on the photosharing site.  The photos are typically not moved and the sent widget references the photos on the appropriate photosharing site and contains the appropriate credentials to access the photos.
<br/><br/> When an album or favorite is sent from a photosharing site the sent widget references the container and when the widget is played it will show the current contents of the container, e.g. All my Flickr photos.  The photos are typically not moved
and the sent widget references the container on the appropriate photosharing site and contains the appropriate credentials to access the photos.
<br/><br/> Designated Upload Site--A Designated Upload Site may be used as a repository for shared photos and videos.  By using an intermediary store in the cloud the receiver does not need to have access to the senders frame and the photos do not have to
be downloaded to the destination frame.  The user may be requested to activate the upload site during account activation on the Web Site.  The activation wizard should be extendable to add multiple possible upload sites.  If the designated upload site is
not set the first time a user attempts to send they will be requested to create and enter their credentials.  The user must be able to enter their user name and password from the client.  the client, users will be informed that if they don't have a Photo
bucket account that they need to go to Photo bucket and create an account before they can send to chums.  From the web, the account creation process can be more guided like Flickr and Face book are.  An option to set the Designated Upload Site may be
made available from the photosharing site configuration screens.
<br/><br/> Adding Local Photos and Video to a Channel--Photos/Videos may be added to a channel by dragging and dropping onto a channel.  When dropped on the chumby category the user will be ask for the destination channel.  If the user only has one channel
it will be added to that channel.  If dropped on a specific channel the resulting widget will be added to the target channel.  When a local album or is added to a channel the resulting widget contains a reference to the photos and when the widget is
played it will show the current contents.  The photos are typically not moved and the widget references the container on the appropriate photosharing site and contains the appropriate credentials to access the photos.
<br/><br/> When an album or favorite from a photosharing is added to a channel the resulting widget contains a reference to the photos and when the widget is played it will show the current contents.  The photos are typically not moved and the widget
references the container on the appropriate photosharing site and contains the appropriate credentials to access the photos.
<br/><br/> When a selection of photos from a photosharing site is added to a channel the resulting widget points to the specific photos.  The photos are typically not moved and the sent widget references the photos on the appropriate photosharing site and
contains the appropriate credentials to access the photos.
<br/><br/> When a selection of internal photos is added to a channel the resulting widget only points to the specific photos.  The photos are typically not moved and the sent widget references the photos on the appropriate photosharing site and contains
the appropriate credentials to access the photos.
<br/><br/> Drag `n` Drop--When "dragging" destinations in left sidebar will designate if they are legal drop points and dragged icon will indicate when areas are not available for dropping
<br/><br/> On "drop"--Drop modal dialogue will be displayed.  The system will acknowledge that the operation has been started.  The status bar will reflect status.  Operations that are not allowed while the operation is being performed will be blocked. 
When sending, a "Send Modal Dialogue" is displayed when the collection is dropped onto a legitimate send target.  Display type of reference: specific photos are being sent or a reference to the container is being sent.
<br/><br/> Name/Rename--If sending a collection of photos there may be a system supplied name that the user can edit.  If sending an album or favorite the name of the album or an Option to Parameterize but can send with defaults.
<br/><br/> Widget play time; Option to attach a message; When adding to a channel, an "Add to channel" dialogue is displayed when the collection is dropped onto a legitimate add to channel target.  Display type of reference: specific photos are being sent
or a reference to the container is being sent.  Name/Rename.  If sending a collection of photos there will be a system supplied name that the user can edit.  If sending an album or favorite the name of the album or option to Parameterize but can send
with defaults.  Widget play time--Option to attach a message--References Descriptions.  A message will appear when the photos are `dropped` that will inform the user of the type of reference that is being sent or placed in a channel.  One of the
following messages may be displayed
<br/><br/> When a selected collection of photos is sent: "The `x` selected photos will be sent as a slideshow widget to &lt;chum&gt;".  When a selected collection of photos (static content) is added to a channel: "The `x` selected photos will be added as a
slideshow widget to &lt;channel name&gt; channel.  When a local album or an Internet photosharing album (dynamic content) is added to a channel: "Adding album &lt;name&gt; to channel as a slideshow widget.  The widget will display the most current
contents of the album when played." When an Internet photosharing album (dynamic content) is sent to a chum: "Sending album &lt;name&gt; to chum as a slideshow widget.  The widget will display the most current contents of the album when played." When
sending a local album to a chum (static content): "photos from album name "zz" will be copied from the album.  The slideshow widget will not reflect any new additions or changes to the album".
<br/><br/> [Sending Photos via Email--An additional feature may be to allow sending photos via email.  Selecting an email address instead of a chum can be accomplished by adding the option to send to an email address when dropping on the general chums
category.  The same references will apply for sending by email except that instead of sending a widget an email is sent with a reference embedded in the email.

Inserted memory cards Inserted USB dongle PCs on a LAN via UPnP photo album Local photos and videos will be displayed in single album viewing mode or they can be made into widgets that are played in a channel standalone or with other widgets.  Each photo
source will be represented as a unique album that can be viewed.  Albums can be added to channels as album widgets and played by the widget player.  There will always be a local "photo channel" that does not require connecting to the internet to be
played.  Local media widgets will be accessible without connecting and activating.  The local photo channel can be played in both disconnected and connected mode.  Photo album widgets can be added to any channel when connected.  Named groups of internal
photos can be created.  Internal Album widgets can be a named group.  The name of the widget will be the named group Mulitple named groups can be added to a channel as different widgets.  The local photo album (implemented as widgets) will be configured
locally with wizards which will guide the user through configuration processes and via menus.  In a simple photo viewing usage model a user will turn on the device, plug in their memory card, and ChumbyFrame will start displaying photos from the inserted
memory card.  The local photo widgets can be added to other channels and intermixed with other chumby widgets.  Any chumby widgets can be added to the photo channel and played with the local photo widgets.  Inserting a memory with photo's will cause the
corresponding album (internal widget) to start displaying the photos On insertion, the frame will switch to the local photo channel and switch to the appropriate photo widget.  Internet photo viewing will be enabled by adding photo sharing widgets to the
photo channel.  Web based wizards will facilitate configuring widgets as albums and adding to the user photo channel.  ChumbyFrame must be connected to the internet view internet photos Internet photo widgets can be intermixed with local photo widgets so
photo shows can contain photos from both local and internet sources.  Chumbyframe must be connected and activated to send/receive photos, access internet audio or access any other chumby network content.  When the frame is connected contents of photo
channel and local widget configurations are reflected on user's account on the web.  Remote control is usable for TBD control panel operations and photo album control.  Chumbyframe will support video chat as an option.  This will be defined in a separate
