<br/><br/>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The invention described herein generally relates to incorporating social networking features into a digital camera.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The instant camera was a camera that generated a self-developed film image upon capturing a photograph.  One of the most popular types used were formerly made by Polaroid Corporation.  Many people have enjoyed seeing their photographs shortly
after taking them.  However, with the advent and popularity of digital photography, the role of instant cameras has diminished.
<br/><br/> Instagram is an online photograph-sharing and social networking service that enables its users to take pictures and share them other social networking services (such as <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, Tumblr and Flickr).  A distinctive feature of Instagram
includes formatting photographs into a square shape, similar to a Polaroid picture.  Instagram also has the ability and tools to turn a basic and boring picture into a creative masterpiece.
<br/><br/> Due to the popularity of the Instagram and its features, many Instagram users have expressed a desire for an "Instagram camera." Nostalgic Polaroid "analog" users and Instagram fans desire a "social camera" that is not a smartphone.  There is
thus a need to merge elements of social networking and online photograph-sharing into a camera.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention provides a method and system for sharing photographic content.  The method comprises generating social media content for a photograph feed associated with a photograph that is shared on a social network, the photograph
located at a first location and including scannable code, receiving activity information associated with the photograph from one or more client devices, the activity information including scanning of the scannable code and geographical data of the one or
more client devices, and determining movements of the photograph from the first location based on the geographical data.  The method further comprises updating the social media content with geographical locations and distances traveled from the first
location based on the activity information and the determined movements.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the scannable code is operable to trigger the one or more client devices to transmit the activity information to the processing device.  Activity information may include an indication of at least one of a scan of the
photograph and a move of the photograph from the first location.  The activity information may also include at least one of an identification of the one or more client devices, identification of the user of the one or more client devices, third party
social media information associated with the one or more client devices, and email information associated with the one or more client devices.  According to another embodiment, the method includes determining second locations based on the determined
movements.
<br/><br/> According to another embodiment the scannable code is operable to direct the one or more client devices to the social media content.  The social media content may include tags, hashtags, comments, and an identification of a user associated with
the photograph.  The method may include receiving post comments and positive indications for the photograph feed, and updating the social media content with the post comments and positive indications.
<br/><br/> The system comprises a processor and a memory having executable instructions stored thereon that when executed by the processor cause the processor to generate social media content for a photograph feed associated with a photograph that is
shared on a social network, the photograph located at a first location and including scannable code, receive activity information associated with the photograph from one or more client devices, the activity information including scanning of the scannable
code and geographical data of the one or more client devices, determine movements of the photograph from the first location based on the geographical data, and update the social media content with geographical locations and distances traveled from the
first location based on the activity information and the determined movements.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the scannable code is operable to trigger the one or more client devices to transmit the activity information to the processor.  Activity information may include an indication of at least one of a scan of the photograph and a
move of the photograph from the first location.  The activity information may also include at least one of an identification of the one or more client devices, identification of the user of the one or more client devices, third party social media
information associated with the one or more client devices, and email information associated with the one or more client devices.  According to another embodiment, the processor is operable to determining second locations based on the determined
movements.
<br/><br/> According to another embodiment the scannable code is operable to direct the one or more client devices to the social media content.  The social media content may include tags, hashtags, comments, and an identification of a user associated with
the photograph.  The processor may also receive post comments and positive indications for the photograph feed, and update the social media content with the post comments and positive indications. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

provide only a few possible examples.  The term "social network" refers generally to a network of individuals, such as acquaintances, friends, family, colleagues, or co-workers, coupled via a communications network or via a variety of sub-networks. 
Social media sites, social networking sites, and social photograph networks are hereby collectively referred to as "social networks" or "social networking sites."
<br/><br/> Potentially, additional relationships on a social network may subsequently be formed as a result of social interaction via the communications network or sub-networks.  A social network may be employed, for example, to identify additional
connections for a variety of activities, including, but not limited to, dating, job networking, receiving or providing service referrals, content sharing, creating new associations, maintaining existing associations, identifying potential activity
partners, performing or supporting commercial transactions, or the like.  A social network may include individuals with similar experiences, opinions, education levels or backgrounds.  Subgroups may exist or be created according to user profiles of
individuals, for example, in which a subgroup member may belong to multiple subgroups.  An individual may also have multiple "1:few" associations within a social network, such as for family, college classmates, or co-workers.
<br/><br/> An individual's social network may refer to a set of direct personal relationships or a set of indirect personal relationships.  A direct personal relationship refers to a relationship for an individual in which communications may be individual
to individual, such as with family members, friends, colleagues, co-workers, or the like.  An indirect personal relationship refers to a relationship that may be available to an individual with another individual although no form of individual to
individual communication may have taken place, such as a friend of a friend, or the like.  Different privileges or permissions may be associated with relationships in a social network.  A social network also may generate relationships or connections with
entities other than a person, such as companies, brands, or so called `virtual persons.` An individual's social network may be represented in a variety of forms, such as visually, electronically or functionally.  For example, a "social graph" or
"socio-gram" may represent an entity in a social network as a node and a relationship as an edge or a link.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, a given client may be a digital instant camera that includes the ability to take photographs, view the photographs on the client device, edit the photographs, apply image processing functions, upload or share the
photographs on social networks, and print the photographs.  The digital instant camera may be branded and designed according to a classic theme (e.g., a Polaroid camera), or a variety of recognizable themes.  FIG. 2A, 2B and 2C present exemplary client

delete, edit or process photographs stored on the client device.  In one embodiment, creating the photograph includes applying one of a plurality of photographic filters selected by a user of the client device to the image.  The photographic filters may
be selected from a "standard set" of filters known to one of ordinary skill in the art or provided by a sponsoring company of a branded client device or from an online photograph sharing/social networking service.  Photographs stored on the client device
may be shared or printed.  A determination is made whether a user of the client device has selected to share or print a given photograph, step 306.
<br/><br/> The given photograph can be shared upon user selection, step 308.  Photographs may be sent, shared, or uploaded from the client device to one or more social networking sites using a network connection.  Shared photographs may be posted on one or
more social network accounts of the user.  The user may tag, comment, email, blog, or post any shared photograph for viewing by one or more users.  The photographs may be shared either publicly or privately according to rules configurable by the user.  A
photograph may also be shared among devices via a private local network (e.g., Wifi), Bluetooth, or NFC technology.
<br/><br/> If the user selects to print a photograph, metadata is associated with the photograph, step 310.  Photographs, either taken on the client device on retrieved from other client device may be printed on the client device.  The metadata may include
an ID such as a username or nickname the user who took the photograph, one or more social networking accounts, and geography information.  A unique photograph ID may also be generated based on the metadata for each photograph taken on the client device. 
The geography information may indicate a current user location either entered by the user or obtained via GPS or other location identification technologies.  User may have one or more social networking accounts that of which the selected photograph and
metadata may be uploaded.  If the user does not have an account with a social networking account, the user may be prompted to sign up and create a new account.
<br/><br/> In a next step 312, a scannable code is generated.  The scannable code is a unique code generated based on the metadata and/or the unique photograph ID.  That is, the scannable code will be unique to each photograph and include therein
sufficient information to identify the particular photograph when scanned.  The photograph is printed in step 314.  According to one embodiment, the photograph may be printed in the fashion of a "Polaroid picture."
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 presents capturing an image by on a client device according to an embodiment of the present invention.  A user may take a photograph of target object 404 using a client device 400.  According to one embodiment, photographs may be taken

<br/><br/> An exemplary printed photograph according one an embodiment of the present invention is presented in FIG. 7.  A photograph 700 may be printed with the scannable code 704, an identification of the user 702 (such as a username on a social
networking account) with the user's avatar or profile picture, and an identification of a social networking site to follow the user 706 (e.g., "Follow me on Instagram").  The scannable code 704 may be printed on the photograph 700 in the form of a 2-D
barcode, a QR code, or any other type of barcode.  Other users may scan the scannable code 704 via a client device or any device capable of scanning the scannable code 704 to "follow" the user of the photograph, for example, on his/her social networking
account(s) or any other web site and view other photographs taken by the user.  The printed photograph 700 may also include a blank writeable area 708 under the photograph image where the user can write a message.  In another embodiment, the client
device may allow a user to input text and print the input text in the blank area.  The photograph 700 may be printed on a peelable sticker or a paper with an adhesive backing.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 presents an exemplary photograph sticker according to an embodiment of the present invention.  A sticker backing allows the user to physically adhere, post, or stick the photograph 800 on a surface.  The sticker backing may be exposed by
peeling on strip 802.  As illustrated in FIG. 9, a user may choose to place a photograph 904 on a pole 902 at a given location 900.  The scannable code on the photograph 904 allow passerby's who express interest in the photograph 904 to follow and
connect to the user's web page, social networking account, or content designated by the user.  Like any other social network, the present invention is based around having friends or followers.  When a person follows someone, their photographs show up in
that person's social network stream or feed, where the person may "like" and/or comment on them.  Scanning the scannable code includes reading the scannable code, retrieving an ID and location of the scanning user/device, and also the information on the
scannable code.  If the scanning user is not a member of a given social network associated with the photograph, the scanning user may be directed to a website to sign up for an account and/or app store to download an app to see the photograph online.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 presents an example of a photograph 1006A existing or moved to a plurality locations according to an embodiment of the present invention.  A user may have the option to move or "re-shoot" a given photograph in another location 1008
different than from its original location 1002.  In the illustrated example, a first instance 1006B of photograph 1006A may be placed on pole 1004 at location 1002 and moved to location 1008 on pole 1010 as a second instance 1006C of photograph 1006A. 
The user who took the photograph may also log in to the social networking site(s) maintaining the photograph and/or metadata of the photograph to see the photograph as well as determine if the photograph has "moved." The user who took the photograph may
track where photographs have been scanned.  When a scanning user scans a photograph, the geographical data of the scanning user may be uploaded to the server or social networking site storing the photograph and/or metadata of the photograph.  The
geographical data of scanning users may be recorded on the server or social networking site where the user may track and review the location of the photograph and scanning users.  Users may also link their social networking accounts with friends.  Linked
members may see where each others' photographs are located.
<br/><br/> Photographs including a scannable code provide for the ability to track people that, scanning the code with another camera or with a client device application or similar, "see" or "move" the photographs using a social media interface.  For
example, users may move photos, both physically, carrying a photo in another place and then scanning them again, or "virtually," reprinting the same in another place creating a copy.  Social media content may be created for scannable photographs that are
shared on the social media interface.  Scanning the scannable code of the photographs may trigger a scanning device (any client device as described herein) to transmit an indication of activity to the social media interface.  The indication of activity
may include a scan and/or a move of the photograph.  The activity may further include information such as geographical data of the scanning device, an identification of the scanning device or user of the device (e.g., a user of the social media
interface), and third party social media and email information associated with the scanning device or user, one or all of which may be transmitted to the social media interface.  The scannable code may be used by the scanning user to identify a
particular user of the social media interface associated with photograph.  According to one embodiment, photographs may be printed with the scannable code for other users to scan and direct the other users to a web page on the social media interface
including social media content with the details of the photograph and of the photographer.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 and FIG. 12 present exemplary interfaces for a social media feature according to an embodiment of the present invention.  Using the social media interface, a user is able to view the photograph, the user profile of the photographer, and
the details of the photograph such as the amount of miles the photograph has "moved," cities of which the photograph were seen (e.g., scanned by other users), the scannable code associated with the photograph, tags, hashtags, and comments.  For example,
each photograph may be associated with a unique feed on the social media interface where users can post comments, follow a user or photograph, "like" or click on an icon to provide a positive indication for the photograph, send messages to other users,
share the photograph with other users through the social media interface, email or to another website, and download the photograph.  Another feature of the social media interface may include viewing movements or activities associated with a photograph on
a map as illustrated in FIG. 13.  A user of the social media interface is able to see the geographical locations of where his/her photographs have been scanned, printed, or moved.
