<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> The present disclosure relates generally to networking systems that enable users to post and share media (such as photographs and videos) and, more particularly, to automatically tagging one or more users to an image or other multimedia file
based on location information.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system.  The social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a user profile, in
connection with the user.  The user profile may include a user's demographic information, communication channel information, and personal interest.  The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user's relationship with other users
in the social networking system (e.g., social graph), as well as provide services (e.g., wall-posts, photo-sharing, or instant messaging) to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system.  A geo-social networking system is a
social networking system in which geographic services and capabilities are used to enable additional social interactions.  User-submitted location data or geo-location techniques (e.g., mobile phone position tracking) can allow a geo-social network to
connect and coordinate users with local people or events that match their interests.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments relate to automatically tagging one or more users to an image file by using location information to improve the accuracy of the process.  These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in
more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a social networking system with location-based services and capabilities.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an example method of tagging one or more users to an image file in a social networking system with location-based services and capabilities.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an example method of tagging an event to an image file in a social networking system with location-based services and capabilities.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 shows an example user interface.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates an example network environment.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 illustrates an example computer system.
<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The invention is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.  In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding
of the present disclosure.  It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details.  In other instances, well known process steps and/or structures have not been
described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure.  In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the
disclosure to the described embodiments.  To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.
<br/><br/> A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it, and with each other through, the system.  Typically, to become a registered user of a social networking system, an entity, either human or
non-human, registers for an account with the social networking system.  Thereafter, the registered user may log into the social networking system via an account by providing, for example, a correct login ID or username and password.  As used herein, a
"user" may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.
<br/><br/> When a user first registers for an account with a social networking system, the social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a "user profile", in connection with the user.  The user profile may include information
provided by the user and information gathered by various systems, including the social networking system, relating to activities or actions of the user.  For example, the user may provide his name, contact information, birth date, gender, marital status,
family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, and other demographical information to be included in his user profile.  The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user considers to be his friends. A list of the user's friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user's profile.  Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction.  For example, if Bob and Joe are both users and connect with
each another, Bob and Joe are each connections of the other.  If, on the other hand, Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam's posted content items, but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob, a one-way connection may be formed where Sam is Bob's
connection, but Bob is not Sam's connection.  Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections (e.g., friends of friends).  Connections may be added explicitly by a user, for
example, the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend, or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users (e.g., users who are alumni of the same educational institution).  The user may
identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user's profile.
<br/><br/> The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user (such as contact information and interests) at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time.  The user may also update his or her profile information at
any time.  For example, when the user moves, or changes a phone number, he may update his contact information.  Additionally, the user's interests may change as time passes, and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time.  A
user's activities on the social networking system, such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system, may also provide information that may be included in the user's profile.  Again, such information may be updated from time to time to
reflect the user's most-recent activities.  Still further, other users or so-called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user's profile.  For example, a contact may add the user as a friend (or
remove the user as a friend).  A contact may also write messages to the user's profile pages--typically known as wall-posts.  Still further, the social networking system may store one or more images of faces that are associated with individual users. 
This data can be used, as discussed below, to match faces in newly uploaded media files to users of the social networking system.
<br/><br/> A social network system may maintain social graph information, which can be generally defined by the relationships among groups of individuals, and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds.  A social
network may be represented using a graph structure.  Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network.  Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users.  In addition, the degree of separation between any two
nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other.  A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.
<br/><br/> A social networking system may support a variety of applications, such as photo sharing, on-line calendars and events.  For example, the social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities.  For example, the social networking
system may allow users to post photographs and other multimedia files to a user's profile, such as in a wall post or in a photo album, both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system.  Social networking system may also
allow users to configure events.  For example, a first user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event, location of the event and other users invited to the event.  The invited users may receive invitations to the event
and respond (such as by accepting the invitation or declining it).  Furthermore, social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar.  Similarly to events, the calendar entries may include times and dates, locations and identities of
other users.
<br/><br/> Social networking system may maintain a database of information relating to places.  Places correspond to various physical locations, such as restaurants, bars, train stations, airports and the like.  Some places may correspond to larger regions
that themselves contain places--such as a restaurant or a gate location in an airport.  In one implementation, each place can be maintained as a hub node in a social graph or other data structure maintained by the social networking system, as described
in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 12/763,171.  Social networking system may allow users to access information regarding each place using a client application (e.g., a browser) hosted by a wired or wireless station, such as a laptop, desktop or mobile
device.  For example, social networking system may serve web pages (or other structured documents) to users that request information about a place.  In addition to user profile and place information, the social networking system may track or maintain
other information about the user.  For example, the social networking system may support geo-social networking system functionality including one or more location-based services that record the user's location.  For example, users may access the
geo-social networking system using a special-purpose client application hosted by a mobile device of the user (or a web- or network-based application using a browser client).  The client application may automatically access Global Positioning System
(GPS) or other geo-location functions supported by the mobile device and report the user's current location to the geo-social networking system.  In addition, the client application may support geo-social networking functionality that allows users to
check-in at various locations and communicate this location to other users.  A check-in to a given place may occur when a user is physically located at a place and, using a mobile device, access the geo-social networking system to register the user's
presence at the place.  As described below, a user may select a place from a list of existing places near to the user's current location or create a new place.  The user may also provide comments in a text string when checking in to a given place.  The
user may also identify one or more other users in connection with a check-in (such as friends of a user) and associate them with the check-in as well.  U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 12/574,614, which is incorporated by reference herein for all
purposes, describes a system that allows a first user to check-in other users at a given place.  An entry including the comment and a time stamp corresponding to the time the user checked in may be displayed to other users.  For example, a record of the
user's check-in activity may be stored in a database.  Social networking system may select one or more records associated with check-in activities of users at a given place and include such check-in activity in web pages (or other structured documents)
that correspond to a given place.  For example, social networking system may select the check-in activity associated with the friends or other social contacts of a user that requests a page corresponding to a place.  U.S.  application Ser.  No.
12/858,718, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes, describes an example geo-social networking system that can be used in connection with various embodiments of the present invention.
<br/><br/> A user may or may not wish to share his information with other users or third-party applications, or a user may wish to share his information only with specific users or third-party applications.  A user may control whether his information is
shared with other users or third-party applications through privacy settings associated with his user profile.  For example, a user may select a privacy setting for each user datum associated with the user.  The privacy setting defines, or identifies,
the set of entities (e.g., other users, connections of the user, friends of friends, or third party application) that may have access to the user datum.  The privacy setting may be specified on various levels of granularity, such as by specifying
particular entities in the social network (e.g., other users), predefined groups of the user's connections, a particular type of connections, all of the user's connections, all first-degree connections of the user's connections, the entire social
network, or even the entire Internet (e.g., to make the posted content item index-able and searchable on the Internet).  A user may choose a default privacy setting for all user data that is to be posted.  Additionally, a user may specifically exclude
certain entities from viewing a user datum or a particular type of user data.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example social networking system with automated media tagging capabilities.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store user profile data in user profile database 101.  In particular embodiments, the
social networking system may store user event data in event database 102.  For example, a user may register a new event by accessing a client application to define an event name, a time and a location, and cause the newly created event to be stored in
event database 102.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store user privacy policy data in privacy policy database 103.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store geographic and location data in location
database 104.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store media data (e.g., photos, or video clips) in media database 105.  In particular embodiments, databases 101, 102, 103, 104, and 105 may be operably connected to the social
networking system's front end 120.  In particular embodiments, the front end 120 may interact with client device 122 through network cloud 121.  Client device 122 is generally a computer or computing device including functionality for communicating
(e.g., remotely) over a computer network.  Client device 122 may be a desktop computer, laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), in- or out-of-car navigation system, smart phone or other cellular or mobile phone, or mobile gaming device, among
other suitable computing devices.  Client device 122 may execute one or more client applications, such as a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera, etc.), to access and view content
over a computer network.  Front end 120 may include web or HTTP server functionality, as well as other functionality, to allow users to access the social networking system.  Network cloud 121 generally represents a network or collection of networks (such
as the Internet or a corporate intranet, or a combination of both) over which client devices 122 may access the social network system.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store an information base of places, where each place includes a name, a geographic location and meta information (such as the user that initially created the place, reviews, comments,
check-in activity data, and the like).  Places may be created by administrators of the system and/or created by users of the system.  For example, a user may register a new place by accessing a client application to define a place name and provide a
geographic location and cause the newly created place to be registered in location database 104.  In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store geo-location data identifying a real-world geographic location of an object, such as a mobile
device.  For example, a geographic location of an Internet connected computer can be identified by the computer's IP address.  For example, a geographic location of a cell phone equipped with Wi-Fi and GPS capabilities can be identified by cell tower
triangulation, Wi-Fi positioning, and/or GPS positioning.  In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store a geographic location and additional information of a plurality of places.  For example, a place can be a local business, a point of
interest (e.g., Union Square in San Francisco, Calif.), a college, a city, or a national park.  For example, a geographic location of a place (e.g., a local coffee shop) can be an address, a set of geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), or a
reference to another place (e.g., "the coffee shop next to the train station").  For example, a geographic location of a place with a large area (e.g., Yosemite National Park) can be a shape (e.g., a circle, or a polygon) approximating the boundary of
the place and/or a centroid of the shape.  For example, additional information of a place can be business hours, photos, or user reviews of the place.  In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store a user's location data.  For example,
location database 104 may store a user's check-in activities.  For example, a user can create a place (e.g., a new restaurant or coffee shop) and the social networking system can store the created place in location database 104.  For example, location
database 104 can store a user's search activity.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a user of the social networking system may upload one or more media files to media database 105.  For example, a user can upload a photo or a set of photos (often called a photo album), or a video clip to media
database 105 from a client device 122 (e.g., a computer, or a camera phone).  In particular embodiments, the one or more media files may contain metadata (often called "tags") associated with each media file.  For example, a photo shot by a digital
camera may contain metadata relating to file size, resolution, time stamp, name of the camera maker, and/or location (e.g., GPS) coordinates.  A user can add additional metadata values to a photo, or tag a photo, during an upload process.  Some examples
of tags of a media file are author, title, comments, event names, time, location, names of people appearing in the media file, or user comment.  In particular embodiments, a user may tag a media file by using a client application (e.g., a photo or video
editor), or entering one or more tags in a graphical user interface of a media uploading tool that uploads a user's one or more media files from a client device 122 to the social networking system.  A user may also tag a media file after an upload at a
later time in the social networking system's web site.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may also extract metadata from a media file and store the metadata in media database 105.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an example method of tagging one or more users to an image file in a social networking system with location-based services and capabilities.  FIG. 2 can be implemented by an auto-tagging process hosted on one or more computing
devices of the social networking system.  The following process can be executed on-demand in response to a photo-upload or tagging request or as a background or batch process.  In particular embodiments, the auto-tagging process may access an image file
associated with a user of the social networking system, such as a user that uploaded the image file (201).  In particular embodiments, an image file may be a photo with associated metadata.  In particular embodiments, an image file may be a video clip
with associated metadata.  For example, the auto-tagging process can access a photo in media database 105.  In particular embodiments, the auto-tagging process may identify one or more faces in the image file that correspond to other users of social
networking system or individuals generally (202).  In particular embodiments, for each identified face in the image file, the auto-tagging process may create a list of potential matches (203 and 204).  In one implementation, the pool of faces that are
analyzed are limited to a set of users that are connected in a social graph to the user that uploaded (or is otherwise associated with) the image file.  For example, the matching process may limit the pool of candidate faces to the user's first-degree
contacts.  In other implementations, the pool of candidate faces may be limited to second degree contacts.  In particular embodiments, the social networking network may determine a match between a face and a user based on application of a facial
recognition or matching algorithm that returns a matching score and comparing the score to a threshold value.  For example, facial recognition computer software can calculate a correlation coefficient between a potential match and an identified face,
where the correlation coefficient ranges from 0.0 ("no correlation at all") to 1.0 ("perfect match").  Suitable recognition algorithms include Principal Component Analysis with eigenface, Linear Discriminate Analysis, Elastic Bunch Graph Matching
fisherface, Hidden Markov model, and neuronal motivated dynamic link matching.  The auto-tagging process can select all potential matches having a matching score above a threshold value for further analysis.  In particular embodiments, if the
auto-tagging process can not find any potential match for an identified face with a sufficient level of confidence, then the auto-tagging process may proceed to find one or more matches for the next identified face.  In some implementations, the
auto-tagging process may expand the candidate pool of faces from, for example, first-degree contacts of the user or second-degree contacts of the user and re-run the foregoing steps.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, if the auto-tagging process finds one or more potential matches for the identified face, the auto-tagging process may apply spatio-temporal matching (206) to adjust the matching scores for the potential matches (207). 
In particular embodiments, the auto-tagging process may determine location data of an image file by accessing geographic location data (e.g. GPS coordinates), user check-in activity data, and/or event data associated with the image file, or based on one
or more previous matches already identified in the image file, where the matched user's location is known with some threshold degree of confidence.  For example, the auto-tagging process can determine that a photo is associated with a location of the
Golden Gate Bridge by a user's tag to the photo (e.g., "Golden Gate Bridge"), or by the photo's geographic location data (e.g., 37.degree.  49'09.15'' N, 122.degree.  28'45 11'' W) that was appended by a camera or other image capture device.  For
example, the auto-tagging process can determine that a photo is associated with location Golden Gate Bridge and time stamp Oct.  8, 2009 by an event tagged by a user to the photo (e.g., "Fleet Week 2009, Golden Gate Bridge, Oct.  8, 2009"), or a title of
a photo album that the photo belongs to (e.g., "Golden Gate Bridge, Oct.  8, 2009").  For example, if a user is already identified in an image file (e.g., having a correlation coefficient=1.0), the image file has a time stamp of Oct.  8, 2009, and the
user has an event "Fleet Week 2009, Golden Gate Bridge, Oct.  8, 2009", then the auto-tagging process can determine that the image file is associated with an event "Fleet Week 2009" and with a location "Golden Gate Bridge."
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store location data for a user corresponding to a potential facial match in the filtered subset of potential matches.  A location data record associated with a user may include location data
and a time stamp that are in close proximity to the location associated with the image file.  As in previous example, a user corresponding to a potential match in the selected subset of potential matches may have checked in at the Golden Gate Bridge
using a geo-social networking client on Oct.  8, 2009.  In connection with check-ins using a geo-social networking client application, the location database may store GPS location (e.g., 37.degree.  49'09.15'' N, 122.degree.  28'45 11'' W) on Oct.  8,
2009, as provided by the client application.  Alternatively or additionally, the user may have configured for a calendar entry with a location of "Golden Gate Bridge" on the day Oct.  8, 2009." Still further, the user may have configured, or registered
as attending, an event having a location near or at the Golden Gate Bridge.  The event management functionality of the social networking system may expose this data to location database 104.  In particular embodiments, the auto-tagging process may adjust
a matching score associated with the potential match (such as the correlation coefficient computed from facial recognition analysis), if the location data associated with the potential match is in close spatio-temporal proximity to the location data
associated with the image file.  The auto-tagging process may determine a match between a face of a user by comparing the adjusted match score to a threshold value.  As in the previous example of the correlation coefficient, if a potential match has a
correlation coefficient of 0.75 as calculated by the facial recognition computer software, and the potential match in close spatio-temporal proximity to the location data associated with the image file, the auto-tagging process can increase the match
score by 0.2.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the auto-tagging process analyzes the adjusted matching scores to determine whether any matches have been identified (208).  In one implementation, the auto-tagging process compares the adjusted score to a threshold
value and deems any face of a candidate user above the threshold as a match.  In one implementation, the auto-tagging process determines whether the adjusted match score is greater than or equal to a threshold value (e.g. 0.9).  If there are two or more
matches in the subset of potential matches for an identified face (209), the auto-tagging process may submit the two or more matches in the subset of potential matches to a user to confirm (Step 210).  In other implementations, the auto-tagging process
may select the highest scoring match.  In particular embodiments, the auto-tagging process may tag the one or more matches to the image file (Step 211).
<br/><br/> As FIG. 4 illustrates, in some implementations, the social networking system may present the tag corresponding to a name of a recognized user to the user as auto-tagged results and allow the user to confirm whether he or she wishes to add the
tags to the image.  For example, a box 402 can be The auto-tagging results can be presented to the user that uploaded the photo during an upload process or at a later time.  In addition, the auto-tagging results can be presented to other users that are
viewing the image.  The other users can confirm that the auto-tagging results are accurate or inaccurate, which information can be used to train the facial recognition algorithms used to identify matches.  In addition, the process configured above can be
used to select a candidate pool of users in a type-ahead field of a user interface directed to tagging users.  For example, the text in the type ahead field can be used to filter the potential matches by user name, while the location-adjusted facial
recognition scores can be used to rank the results.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an example method of tagging an event to an image file in a social networking system with location-based services and capabilities.  In particular embodiments, the auto-tagging process may access an image file corresponding a
user identifier.  In particular embodiments, an image file may be a photo with associated metadata.  In particular embodiments, an image file may be a video clip with associated metadata.  For example, the social networking can access a photo uploaded to
media database 105 by a user (Step 301).  In particular embodiments, the auto-tagging process may extract metadata associated with the image file.  For example, the auto-tagging process may extract from photo metadata time stamp, location, or one or more
users associated with the photo.  For example, the auto-tagging process can extract one or more users associated with a photo by utilizing the example method depicted in FIG. 2 or by using manually tagged results.  In particular embodiments, the
auto-tagging process may match an event corresponding to the image file.  In particular embodiments, the auto-tagging process may match an event to the image file by identifying events that include users that are also tagged or otherwise associated with
the image.  For example, the auto-tagging process may compare the users identified in the image, as well as the spatio-temporal data associated with such users (e.g., from check-in activity, events, calendars and the like) and identify whether the spatio
temporal data of the users match the spatio-temporal data associated with the image.  In particular embodiments, if the auto-tagging process finds a matching event to the image file, then the auto-tagging process may tag the image file with the matching
event (Step 303 and 304).  For example, if a photo has a location tag "Golden Gate Bridge" and a time stamp "Oct.  8, 2009", and a user tagged to the photo has an event "Fleet Week 2009, Golden Gate Bridge, Oct.  8, 2009" on his calendar in the social
networking system, then the auto-tagging process can tag the event "Fleet Week 2009, Golden Gate Bridge, Oct.  8, 2009" to the photo since the event matched the location tag and the time stamp of the photo.
<br/><br/> While the foregoing embodiments may be implemented in a variety of network configurations, the following illustrates an example network environment for didactic, and not limiting, purposes.  FIG. 5 illustrates an example network environment 500. Network environment 500 includes a network 510 coupling one or more servers 520 and one or more clients 530 to each other.  Network environment 500 also includes one or more data storage 540 linked to one or more servers 520.  Particular embodiments may
be implemented in network environment 500.  For example, social networking system frontend 120 may be written in software programs hosted by one or more servers 520.  For example, event database 102 may be stored in one or more storage 540.  In
particular embodiments, network 510 is an intranet, an extranet, a virtual private network (VPN), a local area network (LAN), a wireless LAN (WLAN), a wide area network (WAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a portion of the Internet, or another
network 510 or a combination of two or more such networks 510.  The present disclosure contemplates any suitable network 510.
<br/><br/> One or more links 550 couple a server 520 or a client 530 to network 510.  In particular embodiments, one or more links 550 each includes one or more wired, wireless, or optical links 550.  In particular embodiments, one or more links 550 each
includes an intranet, an extranet, a VPN, a LAN, a WLAN, a WAN, a MAN, a portion of the Internet, or another link 550 or a combination of two or more such links 550.  The present disclosure contemplates any suitable links 550 coupling servers 520 and
clients 530 to network 510.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, each server 520 may be a unitary server or may be a distributed server spanning multiple computers or multiple datacenters.  Servers 520 may be of various types, such as, for example and without limitation, web server,
news server, mail server, message server, advertising server, file server, application server, exchange server, database server, or proxy server.  In particular embodiments, each server 520 may include hardware, software, or embedded logic components or
a combination of two or more such components for carrying out the appropriate functionalities implemented or supported by server 520.  For example, a web server is generally capable of hosting websites containing web pages or particular elements of web
pages.  More specifically, a web server may host HTML files or other file types, or may dynamically create or constitute files upon a request, and communicate them to clients 530 in response to HTTP or other requests from clients 530.  A mail server is
generally capable of providing electronic mail services to various clients 530.  A database server is generally capable of providing an interface for managing data stored in one or more data stores.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, one or more data storages 540 may be communicatively linked to one or more severs 520 via one or more links 550.  In particular embodiments, data storages 540 may be used to store various types of information.  In
particular embodiments, the information stored in data storages 540 may be organized according to specific data structures.  In particular embodiment, each data storage 540 may be a relational database.  Particular embodiments may provide interfaces that
enable servers 520 or clients 530 to manage, e.g., retrieve, modify, add, or delete, the information stored in data storage 540.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, each client 530 may be an electronic device including hardware, software, or embedded logic components or a combination of two or more such components and capable of carrying out the appropriate functions implemented
or supported by client 530.  For example and without limitation, a client 530 may be a desktop computer system, a notebook computer system, a netbook computer system, a handheld electronic device, or a mobile telephone.  The present disclosure
contemplates any suitable clients 530.  A client 530 may enable a network user at client 530 to access network 530.  A client 530 may enable its user to communicate with other users at other clients 530.
<br/><br/> A client 530 may have a web browser 532, such as MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER, GOOGLE CHROME or MOZILLA FIREFOX, and may have one or more add-ons, plug-ins, or other extensions, such as TOOLBAR or YAHOO TOOLBAR.  A user at client 530 may enter a
Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or other address directing the web browser 532 to a server 520, and the web browser 532 may generate a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request and communicate the HTTP request to server 520.  Server 520 may accept the
HTTP request and communicate to client 530 one or more Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) files responsive to the HTTP request.  Client 530 may render a web page based on the HTML files from server 520 for presentation to the user.  The present disclosure
contemplates any suitable web page files.  As an example and not by way of limitation, web pages may render from HTML files, Extensible Hyper Text Markup Language (XHTML) files, or Extensible Markup Language (XML) files, according to particular needs. 
Such pages may also execute scripts such as, for example and without limitation, those written in JAVASCRIPT, JAVA, MICROSOFT SILVERLIGHT, combinations of markup language and scripts such as AJAX (Asynchronous JAVASCRIPT and XML), and the like.  Herein,
reference to a web page encompasses one or more corresponding web page files (which a browser may use to render the web page) and vice versa, where appropriate.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 illustrates an example computer system 600, which may be used with some embodiments of the present invention.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable number of computer systems 600.  This disclosure contemplates computer system 600
taking any suitable physical form.  As example and not by way of limitation, computer system 600 may be an embedded computer system, a system-on-chip (SOC), a single-board computer system (SBC) (such as, for example, a computer-on-module (COM) or
system-on-module (SOM)), a desktop computer system, a laptop or notebook computer system, an interactive kiosk, a mainframe, a mesh of computer systems, a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a server, or a combination of two or more of
these.  Where appropriate, computer system 600 may include one or more computer systems 600; be unitary or distributed; span multiple locations; span multiple machines; or reside in a cloud, which may include one or more cloud components in one or more
networks.  Where appropriate, one or more computer systems 600 may perform without substantial spatial or temporal limitation one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein.  As an example and not by way of limitation, one or
more computer systems 600 may perform in real time or in batch mode one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein.  One or more computer systems 600 may perform at different times or at different locations one or more steps of
one or more methods described or illustrated herein, where appropriate.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, computer system 600 includes a processor 602, memory 602, storage 606, an input/output (1/O) interface 608, a communication interface 610, and a bus 612.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates a particular
computer system having a particular number of particular components in a particular arrangement, this disclosure contemplates any suitable computer system having any suitable number of any suitable components in any suitable arrangement.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, processor 602 includes hardware for executing instructions, such as those making up a computer program.  As an example and not by way of limitation, to execute instructions, processor 602 may retrieve (or fetch) the
instructions from an internal register, an internal cache, memory 602, or storage 606; decode and execute them; and then write one or more results to an internal register, an internal cache, memory 602, or storage 606.  In particular embodiments,
processor 602 may include one or more internal caches for data, instructions, or addresses.  The present disclosure contemplates processor 602 including any suitable number of any suitable internal caches, where appropriate.  As an example and not by way
of limitation, processor 602 may include one or more instruction caches, one or more data caches, and one or more translation look-aside buffers (TLBs).  Instructions in the instruction caches may be copies of instructions in memory 602 or storage 606,
