       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> Sales people (agents) get engaged with a lot of contacts from past,
     present and future prospects that manifests on multiple contact
     platforms. They end up having their contacts and calendars split in
     multiple places including communication and messages leading to
     inefficiencies, loss of business and delayed response time to the end
     customer. Customer Relationship Management today is still a one
     dimensional tool, one that featured Email as the core for direct
     agent-client relationship. CRM should be redefined and relabeled as
     Communication Management to open up the idea that relationships with
     clients are developed across multiple platforms though multiple channels.
     As will be understood by reading below, the invention accomplishes this
     in an elegant manner. The phrases Communication Management in the main
     patent title and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) have the same
     semantics in this document.

<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF INVENTION
<br/><br/> The invention includes a method of centralizing and synchronizing contacts coming from all contact sources like emails, social media the salesperson subscribes to.  Simple import of contacts can also be done using CSV imports from other legacy
sources the user has.  Rules may be established in all imports and synching to restrict to certain type of leads or be able to bulk them up in predefined social groups or annotated to an existing social campaign in progress.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the invention may be configured to synchronize all contacts at once from one or more social channels OR driven by rules of synching based on user's preferences.  The synched contact can be further authorized by acceptance as a
friend or a contact by the lead from their own social media accounts which will proceed to show that a specific user is authorized and ready to communicate on one or more social channels.  This authorization may be a prerequisite for user to communicate
with leads and prospects on social media.
<br/><br/> In a subsequent embodiment, new leads and prospects entered in the CRM manually or entered automatically through APIs from other sources or just coming from social media synchs described earlier may be cross referenced to multiple social media
sources to get a better cross section of the user's profile on different social media channels.  New contents could be created manually in the central database and same cross sections from different social media may be done to show the cross section to
the user.
<br/><br/> The features and functions of the invention may be implemented by encoding computer readable software in the form of Microsoft NET, AJAX, C++ and SQL language or other computer readable formats that can configure a computer or server to perform
the features and functions.
<br/><br/> The invention may be designed and implemented on a computer and may be connected to a network for communication with many other computers to practice the invention.  A system configured to operate according to the invention may include a
plurality of PCs, Tablets or mobile PDAs connected to the internet via individual modems or other communication means such as Wi-Fi and Wireless 3G/4G communications.  The invention may involve a number of functions to be performed by a computer
processor, such as a microprocessor.  The microprocessor may be specialized or dedicated microprocessor that is configured to perform certain tasks by executing machine readable software code for a particular task.  The microprocessor may be configured
to operate and communicate with other devices such as direct memory access modules, memory storage devices, internet related hardware and other devices that relate to the transmission of data in accordance with this invention.  The software code may be
configured using software formats like C++, C#, SQL, AJAX, SQL and XML language that may be used to define and present information that relate to operations of devices required to carry out the functional operations related to the invention.  The code
may be written in many forms and styles in the art of computer programming.  Different code formats, code configurations, styles and forms of software programs and other means to configure and release the operation of the microprocessor in accordance
with the invention will not depart from the spirit and scope of the inventions, which is defined by the detail description as well as subparts included therein.
<br/><br/> In another aspect of the invention, allow synchronizing of multiple user calendars across multiple channels including email, local calendars, third party program that generate work flow calendars and one or more social media calendars.  The
system allows single calendar for the user from all sources.  Subsequently, user can create new calendar events in the CRM and broadcast them back to one more calendar outlets they have including local calendar and social media calendars.
<br/><br/> In another aspect of the invention, communication is done bi-directional between the user and all their leads hosted on multiple email system, instant messaging or social media or integrated telephony platforms.  Mass micro blogs may be
broadcasted from the CRM manually or done automatically using complex time and recipient criteria.  One example of implementation is sending a pre created micro blog campaign and broadcasted xx days after the first contact date and sends to all contact
that come from a specific Social Channel; contact type is HOT and contact category is investor and/or landlord.  The system would store and retrieve all these logs on demand based on different search filters.
<br/><br/> The core invention enables bi-directional contact, calendar synchs and communication to happen between the CRM user and their potential leads over the lead incubation period and also logging all events for any search required. <br/><br/>BRIEF

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
<br/><br/> The present invention provides a software application configured for a sales person to connect and communicate concurrently with all their prospects across multiple social media channels including conventional email and be able to incubate the
leads over the lead engagement cycle.  It offers a robust system for a sales person to go to one place and manage all their contacts (leads), calendars and all aspects of their sales campaigns and communication over multiple social channels.
<br/><br/> The admin panel in this software application defines what social media channels the sales person wishes to engage in their sales/marketing campaigns.  E. g. <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, Google+ etc and also the system then connects the sales person
actively to these channels using published APIs from these social channels.  Traditional email campaigns are included but the dominant invention is the ability to engage communications concurrently with multiple social media channels for customer
relationship management (CRM) and analytics on lead behavior.
<br/><br/> Once established system will open connectors (See FIG. 3) to multiple social networking platforms like Google, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter and LinkedIn and so on.  This will give a universal ability for the sales person to track lead behavior on different
social platforms.  Using an Authorization and Authenticated database, this information is stored and retrieved in to CRM database pool or server farms and accessed with high speed.  Such information can also be optionally replicated in to other Single
Sign ON (SSO) systems like Transaction Management (shown in Compliance block) OR financial management (ERP) shown under Money block.
<br/><br/> The CRM module may interface with an MLS module (Multiple Listing service or any paid sources of database) as shown in FIG. 3.  This module may allow the user custom searching, reviewing and creating online flyers for multiple properties, custom
drag and drop flyers.  The MLS module integrates with a legacy based MLS system (not shown) to enable the import of legacy based MLS system data in to the CRM database such that the legacy based MLS system data is readily available to the managing of
prospects and leads.
<br/><br/> Using the application, the sales person (subscriber) can instantly connect to all selected contacts they have on many channels like <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Google etc. They can further download all or preselected list of contacts in to the central CRM
database (FIG. 4).
<br/><br/> The same application allows users to modify the contents of some of these contacts and push/write back to the sources where they came from.
<br/><br/> Using the application, the sales person (subscriber) can instantly connect to all selected calendars they have on many channels like <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Google etc. They can further download calendar contents from each source in to the central CRM
database (FIG. 4).
<br/><br/> The same application allows users to modify/delete or create new events and push/write them back to the calendars of the sources where they came from.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 5, each user can see their own centralized contacts with different status and centralized Calendars showing all events and sources from which they came from.  They could optionally expand on this window to open up all the details of the
contact or calendar in a new browser window.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 shows detailed database schema for one sample database tree hierarchy for the CRM.  The Communication threads are shown along with fields contained under Lead which stores all information related to contact/lead, items they are interested
in, preferences in modes of communication and flags if they need to pushed automatically to other channels e.g. Plaxo or Google if any status changes.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 7, the software application also allows users to see instantly on the main connections dashboard as to which contact/leads came from which source and if they have been "authorized" to certain social media.  This information is
further carried to other modules within the CRM so user can choose to exercise the appropriate media for communication with the customer at any given point in time in the lead engagement cycle.  A lead coming from one Source e.g. <b><i>Facebook</i></b> contact can
also be searched automatically on another platform like LinkedIn allowing rich social media cross section of information for a given lead.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 is a powerful encapsulation of Linked IN platform in the CRM targeted for recruitment.  Once authorized and opened, it gives a display of the sales person own contact as shown in the middle column.  Then they can see details of their own
contacts OR search for NEW people on Linked IN, authorize them and view them and start communicating with them, using the SEND MESSAGE command.  FIGS. 9a and 9b (split screens) show the information on every prospect from social channels is stored
permanently in the CRM database for the lead for future use and analytics.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 is yet another implemented feature of the CRM allowing users to cross connect their own harvested prospects with their own contacts to avoid duplication.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 shows the central communication log panels for searching all micro blogs, messages send/received in the CRM for that account including email communications.  These panels can be searched for a specific message based on date range, user
types, social channel and whether it is INBOUND or OUTBOUND.
<br/><br/> The invention is directed to an apparatus for receiving and processing lead and prospect data related to customer relationship management.  The invention may also include a dedicated processor configured to communicate with computers that
communicate among one or more networks to receive and transmit data packets related to performing this task.  However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that this is illustrative of only one utility of the invention, and that the
invention has greater applicability and utility in many other applications where efficient routines and processing of data for performing online CRM with one or more networks is involved.  Equivalent structures embodying the invention could be configured
for such applications without diverting from the spirit and scope of the invention.  Although this embodiment is described and illustrated in the context of modern databases, the invention extends to other applications where similar features are useful. 
Furthermore, while the foregoing description has been with reference to particular embodiments of the invention, it will be appreciated that these are only illustrative of the invention and that changes may be made to those embodiments without departing
from the principles of the invention, the scope of which is defined by this overall description or any subparts herein.
