       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A reusable bottle cap system includes a bottle cap and a bottle cap
     cover. The bottle cap includes a stem portion extending downwardly from a
     flanged portion. When in use the stem portion is used to seal a bottle
     mouth. When the bottle cap is not in use the bottle cap cover encloses
     and houses the stem portion to protect it from debris. The flanged
     portion includes a complementary mating structure. The bottle cap cover
     includes a mating structure that engages the complementary mating
     structure to secure the bottle cap cover to the flanged portion. When the
     bottle cap cover is secured to the flanged portion the stem portion
     extends substantially to a closed bottom end of an inside surface of the
     bottle cap cover.

INVENTION
<br/><br/> 1.  Field of the Invention
<br/><br/> The present invention pertains generally to methods of environmental preservation and saving of natural resources (specifically water), in addition to preserving manufactured and raw materials.  More particularly, the invention relates to a
reusable bottle cap device providing identification of own bottle to a user, minimizing or eliminating waste associated with any unused portions of the contents therein and encouraging reuse of disposable drinking bottles, especially water bottles.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of the Prior Art
<br/><br/> Many reusable bottle caps have been introduced heretofore also employing identification means.  One early example was proposed by Brixious and was granted U.S.  patent protection in 1961, entitled "Identifying Device," U.S.  Pat.  No. 2,976,629.
<br/><br/> According to Brixious, in bowling alleys, particularly during team play in league competition, spectators and players alike are present in large numbers.  On such occasions, as well as similar gatherings, beverages such as soft drinks, beer and
the like are purchased by both spectators and players who are constantly moving about, and during consumption thereof often set their drinks down at the most convenient location with the intention of returning thereto.  Due to the large number of drinks
that may be temporarily deposited in a relatively restricted area, and the fact that the players and spectators move about during the period of play, confusion as to the ownership of the various drinks often arises.
<br/><br/> In more recent times, the dominant beverage consuming activity has become drinking water from bottles comprised of polyethylene or polyurethane plastic in such gatherings such as: company picnics, sporting events, hiking, camping, boating,
industry and political conventions, trade shows, academic conferences, construction sites, professional groups, and a myriad of networking and social gatherings.  The total bottled water consumption has grown vastly in our most recent history.  According
to the Bottled Water--Global Industry Guide, the market for bottled water grew by 7% in the year 2006 alone.  Additionally, they provide a market forecast of an increase in consumption every year with a total increase of 51% by 2011 since the 2006
levels.  This comes to approximately 174 billion liters of water consumed in a year from bottled water.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to minimize the waste associated with beverage (especially water) drinkers losing track of a beverage (especially water) bottle after the contents have been only partially or marginally
consumed.  Also, the practice of washing, rinsing, and reusing beverage (especially water) bottles is increasing in practice.  Hence, it is an additional object of the present invention to promote this practice and therefore reduce non-biodegradable
landfill waste and raw material consumption.
<br/><br/> Not surprisingly, more recent efforts to gain patent protection on beverage identification means have emerged.  Two such examples are U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,745,505, entitled "Color Coded Beverage Cap Collection with Permanent Passive Indicia
Indicating Beverage Bottle User Identities," to Moran; and U.S.  Pub.  Pat.  App. No. 2009/0026104, entitled "Bottle-Cap Identification System," disclosed by Cassidy.  It is an objective of the present invention to provide a novel alternative design to
those that have been proposed in the prior art that can be can be configured to different beverage (especially water) bottles having varied thread configurations and varied diameter openings at the top, through which the contents are delivered.  It is
further an object of the present invention to provide a design that may be inexpensively cast to a mold and mass produced and therefore comparatively cost effective.  It is still further an object of the present invention to provide a bottle cap cover to
protect the bottle cap from dirt and debris while not in use, thereby maintaining hygiene and thus maximizing the usable life of the present invention.  It is still further noted that the present invention will be sufficiently sturdy to withstand
repeated washings, thereby encouraging multiple uses.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention specifically addresses and alleviates the above mentioned deficiencies associated with the prior art.  More particularly, the present invention, in a first aspect is directed to a reusable bottle cap system (bottle plus
cover) comprising: a bottle cap portion comprising: a stem portion about a vertical axis; and a flanged ring portion about an upper end of the stem portion, wherein the stem portion further comprises a plurality of successive U-shaped grooves along a
length thereof, the U-shaped grooves forming a crest and a trough, the crest between two adjacent troughs forming a point.

form a complementary union with the rim 232 and groove 233 encircling the outer circumference of the open end of the cover 230.  The mating is sized and configured such that the two pieces 210, 230 can snap together with a minimal amount of force.  It is
further contemplated herein that a bottle cap 210 and cover 230 comprised of different colors would serve a purpose of identification.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 2H, the bottle cap 210 herein may have a hollow 220 stem 215, however closed 221 at a bottom end.  Alternatively with reference to FIG. 8, the bottle cap 810 hollow 820 stem may be closed 822 at a top end.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3A illustrates a perspective view of a third preferred bottle cap 310 embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 3B is a profile view of the third preferred embodiment 310; and FIG. 3C illustrates a cross-sectional view taken along sectional
line 3C-3C.  In this embodiment, the flanged ring portion 311 has an outside surface that extends outwardly and downward smoothly and continuously to form a rounded ring from lateral side to a top surface.  Stated differently, the flanged ring portion
311 has a surface having a slope 312, the slope is continuously increasing and negative from a top to a lateral side without a step change in slope 312.  Further, the flanged ring portion 311 is configured to fit around mouths of bottles of varying outer
diameter.  Additionally, the stem 315 is hollow 320 throughout its vertical axis through which a user may dispense of the contents or so that a straw would be permitted to fit through the stern 315.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates yet another reusable bottle cap system 400 comprising bottle cap 410 and cover 430.  It should be readily appreciated that many cap embodiments 110, 210, 310, 410, 510, 710, 810, 910 could be coupled to different cover
embodiments 130, 230, 430.  FIG. 4 is further illustrative of a bottle cap cover 430 having an eyelet 431 on a side thereof.  In this configuration, the cover 430 is generally in the shape of a tea cup having a flat bottom end continuously curving to an
open upper end comprising a rim 432 and groove 433.
<br/><br/> With regard to FIG. 5, a schematic illustration of yet another invention embodiment is shown.  In this variation, the bottle cap top comprises a circular recess 522 to receive a color coded or labeled marker 523.  This labeling may further
comprise one or more of the following: an individual's name/initials/monogram; a company name/moniker/emblem and/or contact information and/or website and/or social networking page (e.g. MySpace, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, etc.) and/or logo; any or all of the
same information for a sports team, a musical artist/band, or a fictional/real character.  The recess 522 is sized such that the marker 523 will fit snugly thereto.  Further, a relief may be provided to the recess 522 to assist a user in removing the
marker 523.
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 6A to FIG. 6E, a manner in which the bottle cap 110, 210, 310, 410, 510, 710, 810, 910 can mate to the inside of the opening of a beverage (especially water) bottle is illustrated with various examples.  Since the bottle
cap contains a slight taper 218, it can mate with a variety of water bottles available at retail having a slightly different size opening.  Also, the invention will fit a water bottle regardless of the thread configuration on the outer part of the
opening.
<br/><br/> Now turning to FIG. 7A through FIG. 7E, another preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated and generally comprises reusable bottle cap 710 with a cover 730 thereto.  FIG. 7A more specifically illustrates an identification
marker 723 coupled to a flanged ring portion 711.  Close inspection of FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B reveals that the stem portion 715 comprises different structure than in previous embodiment.  More particularly, the stem 715 has a cylindrical base 717 and
therefore the surface between adjacent peaks 716 is substantially flat.  The peaks 716 themselves are additionally different than previous embodiment in that they protrude outward with a slight convex surface; whereas the previous embodiment 215
comprises a concave surface 217 to a peak 216 also comprising a point 216, 716.  Additionally, since the peaks 716 comprise a surface that is slightly convex, then also the peaks 716 are not flat or thin like a wafer.
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 7C, a perspective view of the reusable bottle cap embodiment with an identification marker 723 removed is shown.  Identification marker 723 is configured to be received by a recess 722 carved out of the flanged ring
portion 711.  More specifically, the marker 723 comprises a plurality of pins 725 configured to be received by a respective plurality of cavities 724.  With regard to FIG. 7D, the flanged ring portion 711 and stem 715 are hollow 720 so that into which a
straw could fit if the marker 723 was removed.  As with other embodiments, the underside of the flanged ring portion 711 has a lip 719 configured to connect to a lip 732 and groove 733 of a bottle cap cover 730 (FIG. 7E).  In this embodiment 730, the
bottle cap cover 730 is barrel shaped and not bell shaped 230 or cone shaped.  The barrel shape 730 in this modification will result in more usable surface area to affix a logo or a design thereto.  The embodiment similarly comprises an eyelet 731.  It
is still further contemplated that marker 523, 723 and/or bottle cap 110, 210, 310, 410, 510, 710, 810, 910 may comprise cold-activated material, in which a temperature change will cause a chemical within the material to change color, further providing
identification means of own bottle (FIG. 6A through FIG. 6E).
