<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings.  The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.  Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention.
<br/><br/> The term "television content" or "TC," as used herein, is intended to be broadly interpreted to include, for example, visual data or visual data and audio data, such as user interfaces (UIs) and media content.  By way of example, television
content may include television programming (e.g., local programming, national programming, free programming, live-programming (e.g., a live broadcast, etc.), etc.), movies, sports, news, video-on-demand content, premium channel content, television
guides, weather information, sports information, traffic information, horoscope information, games, etc. The source of the television content may include a television content distribution network (TCDN).
<br/><br/> According to exemplary embodiments described herein, television content frames (TC frames) may be captured and shared with others.  According to an exemplary embodiment, a TCDN and customer premises equipment may allow a user to capture TC
frames from TC, allow the user to select TC frame(s) from the captured TC frames, and share the selected TC frame(s) with others.  According to an exemplary embodiment, the TCDN may include a device that captures a time window of TC frames.  According to
another exemplary embodiment, the customer premises may include a device that captures a time window of TC frames.  According to an exemplary embodiment, the device may continuously capture TC frames.  The time window in which TC frames may be captured
may be predefined by the TC service provider or user-configurable.  According to an exemplary embodiment, a user may provide a TC frame capture request to the TCDN (e.g. the device that captures TC frames) or the customer premises device.  In response,
the captured TC frame(s) may be provided (e.g., stored, displayed) to the user.
<br/><br/> The user may then review the captured TC frames and select TC frame(s) to share with others.  By way of example, the user may share the selected TC frame(s) on Internet sites (e.g., social networking sites, such as for example, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b>
Twitter, other types of web sites, etc.), with a user-defined user group, by sending the selected TC frame(s) to others via e-mail, multimedia messaging service (MMS) messages, etc., or to some other type of destination.  According to an exemplary
embodiment, a UI (e.g., a graphical user interface (GUI)) may be displayed to the user to provide one or more operations associated with the capturing and sharing of TC frame(s).
<br/><br/> According to another exemplary embodiment, a user device may allow the user to capture TC frames from TC, allow the user to select TC frame(s), and share the selected TC frame(s) with others.  The term "user device," as used herein, is intended

<br/><br/> FIGS. 1B-1G are diagrams illustrating an exemplary process for TC frame capturing and sharing according to an exemplary embodiment.  While particular messages or information may be illustrated as being sent by or received by a particular device
in environment 100, according to other embodiments, the exemplary messages may be sent by or received by a different device or a combination of devices.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1B, according to an exemplary process, it may be assumed that a user (not illustrated) is watching television content (e.g., a movie).  The user may provide an input to remote device 140-1 that causes remote device 140-1 to
send a TC frame capture request to TCDN interface device 135-1.  As further illustrated, the TC frame capture request may be sent to TCFC 110-1 in TCDN 105.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 1C, according to the exemplary process, TCFC 110-1 may capture a time window of TC frames.  For example, TCFC 110-1 may continuously store a time window of TC frames from TC provided to users.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment, the user may send a TC frame capture request that relates to the capture of TC frames that the user has seen during the provisioning of the television content.  According to another exemplary embodiment, the
user may send a TC frame capture request that relates to the capture of TC frames that the user expects to see during the provisioning of the television content.  According to yet other embodiments, the user may send a TC frame capture request that
relates to the capture of TC frames within some other time window relative to receiving the TC frame capture request.  For example, the time window may include a portion of time before receiving the TC frame capture request and a portion of time after
receiving the TC frame capture request.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment, the duration of the time window for capturing TC frames may be the same as the time window associated with the TC frame capture request.  According to another exemplary embodiment, the time window for
capturing TC frames may be different from the time window associated with the TC frame capture request.  For example, TCFC 110-1 may capture TC frames for a first time period (e.g., a minute, etc.) and the time window associated with the TC frame capture
request may be a shorter time period (e.g., 30 seconds, etc.).  The number of TC frames/time window, a duration of the time window for capturing TC frames, a duration of the time window associated with a TC frame capture request, etc., may be
user-configurable (e.g., user preferences) or predefined in TCDN 105.  Additionally, according to some embodiments, the number of frames/time window and/or the duration of the time windows may each have multiple available settings.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1D, according to the exemplary process, TCFC 110-1 may store the captured TC frames in storage 115-1.  According to another exemplary embodiment, the captured TC frames may be stored elsewhere (e.g., TCDN interface device
135-1, TV 130-1, remote device 140-1).  Additionally, as illustrated in FIG. 1D, TCDN 105 may send a TC frame capture response to the user.  By way of example, the TC frame capture response may be displayed on TV 130-1.  For example, TV 130-1 may display
a GUI that allows the user to see the captured TC frames, as illustrated in FIG. 1E.  In this example, the user may decide to review the captured TC frames in order to send one or more of the captured TC frames to his/her friend(s).  According to another
scenario, the user may store the captured TC frames for review at a later time.  According to the exemplary process, it may be assumed that the user selects several TC frames via remote device 140-1 and TC frame capture selections may be received by TCDN
interface device 135-1 and TCFC 110-1, as illustrated in FIG. 1E.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1F, according to the exemplary process, it may be assumed that the user selects a destination to which the several TC frames selected may be shared.  For example, the user may select names of people, social networking sites,
communication addresses (e.g., e-mail addresses, MMS messages, etc.), user group names, and/or some other type of destination data that permits the several TC frames selected to be shared with that destination.  The user may select different TC frames
for different destinations, select the same TC frames for all destination(s), etc. Additionally, according to an exemplary embodiment, the user may create a message and/or add other content (e.g., textual content, audio content) with selected TC frames
to be shared.  By way of example, the user may wish to add the name of the television content, the episode, description of the scene illustrated in the TC frames, or some other type of commentary, etc. As illustrated, a destination selection may be
received by TCDN interface device 135-1 and TCFC 110-1.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 1G, the selected TC frames may be sent to various destinations.  For example, TCFC 110-1 may provide or identify the user's destination selection and the selected TC frames to TC frame sharing device 120-1.  TC frame
sharing device 120-1 may then manage the sharing of TC frames selected by the user.  By way of example, the selected TC frames may be sent to Internet sites, sent to various individuals as an e-mail or a text message (e.g., MMS message, etc.), or sent to
other users (e.g., subscribers of the TSP).  According to some embodiments, TCDN 105 may include one or more types of communication servers (e.g., e-mail servers, MMS servers, etc.) for its users.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1H is a diagram illustrating another exemplary environment 150 in which an exemplary embodiment for providing television content frame capturing and sharing may be implemented.  As illustrated in FIG. 1H, environment 150 may include TCDN
105, a user device 155, and a network 160.  The number of devices and networks, and configuration in environment 150 is exemplary and provided for simplicity.  In practice, environment 150 may include additional devices, different devices, and/or
differently arranged devices, than those illustrated in FIG. 1H.  For example, TCDN 105 may include a device(s) that performs one or more processes associated with the capturing and sharing of television content.  Additionally, or alternatively, user
device 155 in combination with other device(s) (e.g., TCDN interface device 135, a wireless router, a server, a consumer device, etc.) not included in TCDN 105 may perform one or more processes associated with the capturing and sharing of television
content.  Additionally, or alternatively, in practice, environment 150 may include additional networks, etc., and/or differently arranged networks, than those illustrated in FIG. 1H.  Network 160 may include one or multiple networks of any type.  Network
160 may provide a communication path to destinations selected by the user.  Environment 150 may include wired and/or wireless connections between user device 155 and devices within or between TCDN 105 and/or network 160.
<br/><br/> As previously described, according to an exemplary embodiment, a user device, such as user device 155, may capture TC frames, allow the user to review and select TC frames, and/or share the selected TC frames with others.  For example, user
device 155 may receive television content from TCDN 105.  According to an exemplary embodiment, user device 155 may provide a GUI that allows the user to capture a time window of TC frames from the television content.  Alternatively, according to an
exemplary embodiment, user device 155 may provide a GUI that allows the user to request the capture of a time window of TC frames to another device.  The captured TC frames may be displayed on user device 155 to allow the user to review and select TC
frames to share.  According to an exemplary embodiment, user device 155 may allow the user to send or post the selected TC frames to the appropriate destination.  According to another exemplary embodiment, TC selection information and/or destination
information may be sent from user device 155 to another device (e.g., a network device in TCDN 105 or a device not included in TCDN 105).  The other device may manage the sharing of the selected TC frames.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating exemplary components of a device 200 that may correspond to one or more of the devices in environment 100 and/or environment 150.  For example, device 200 may correspond to TCFC 110, storage 115, TC frame sharing

operation(s) performed by device 200.  Processing system 205 may perform one or multiple operations based on an operating system and/or various applications (e.g., application 215).  Processing system 205 may access instructions from memory/storage 210,
from other components of device 200, and/or from a source external to device 200 (e.g., a network, another device, etc.).
<br/><br/> Memory/storage 210 may include one or multiple memories and/or one or multiple secondary storages.  For example, memory/storage 210 may include a random access memory (RAM), a dynamic random access memory (DRAM), a read only memory (ROM), a
programmable read only memory (PROM), a flash memory, a phase-change memory (PCM), and/or some other type of storing medium (a computer-readable medium, a compact disk (CD), a digital versatile disk (DVD), etc.).  Memory/storage 210 may include a hard
disk (e.g., a magnetic disk, an optical disk, a magneto-optic disk, a solid state disk, etc.) or some other type of storing medium, along with a corresponding drive.  Memory/storage 210 may be external to and/or removable from device 200, such as, for
example, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) memory, a dongle, a hard disk, mass storage, off-line storage, etc.
<br/><br/> The term "computer-readable medium," as used herein, is intended to be broadly interpreted to include, for example, a memory, a secondary storage, a CD, a DVD, or another type of tangible storing medium.  Memory/storage 210 may store data,
application(s), and/or instructions related to the operation of device 200.
<br/><br/> Applications 215 may include software that provides various services and/or functions.  For example, with reference to TCFC 110 and according to an exemplary embodiment, application 215 may include one or multiple applications for capturing TC
frames from television content.  Additionally, or alternatively, for example, with reference to TC frame sharing device 120 and according to an exemplary embodiment, application 215 may include one or multiple applications for sharing/providing TC frames
to destinations.  Additionally, or alternatively, applications 215 may include one or more applications associated with other devices to perform one or more processes described herein.
<br/><br/> Communication interface 220 may permit device 200 to communicate with other devices, networks, systems, etc. Communication interface 220 may include one or multiple wireless interfaces and/or wired interfaces.  Communication interface 220 may
include one or multiple transmitters, receivers, and/or transceivers.  Communication interface 220 may operate according to one or multiple protocols, standards, and/or the like.
<br/><br/> Input 225 may permit an input into device 200.  For example, input 225 may include a keyboard, a mouse, a microphone, a display, a touchpad, a button, a switch, an input port, voice recognition logic, fingerprint recognition logic, a web cam,

<br/><br/> As described herein, device 200 may perform processes in response to processing system 205 executing software instructions (e.g., application 215) contained in a computer-readable medium, such as memory/storage 210.  By way of example, the
software instructions may be read into memory/storage 210 from another computer-readable medium or from another device via communication interface 220.  The software instructions stored in memory/storage 210 may cause processing system 205 to perform one
or more processes described herein.  Alternatively, for example, according to other implementations, device 200 may perform one or more processes described herein based on the execution of hardware (processing system 205, etc.), the execution of hardware
and firmware, or the execution of hardware, software, and firmware.
<br/><br/> As previously described, according to exemplary embodiments, TC frames may be captured and shared with others.  For example, a TCDN and customer equipment may allow a user to capture TC frames, allow the user to select one or multiple TC frames
from the captured TC frames, and share the selected one or multiple TC frames with other people.  Alternatively, a user device or a combination of the user device with other devices may perform one or more of the processes for capturing and sharing TC
frames.  Described below are exemplary processes associated with the capturing and sharing of TC frames.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3A, according to an exemplary embodiment, TCDN 105 may broadcast or provide television content to a user.  In response to viewing the television content, the user may send a TC frame capture request to TCDN 105.  For example,
the user may cause TV 130 to display a GUI via remote device 140 to allow the user to request TC frame capture, or remote device 140 may include a TC frame capture request input.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment, the TC frame capture request may include one or more of the following parameters.  For example, the TC frame capture request may include a TV content parameter (e.g., a TV channel, name of the TV content,
and/or some other type of TV content identifier) to identify the television content with which captured TC frames are associated.  Additionally, or alternatively, according to an exemplary embodiment, the TC frame capture request may include a time
window duration parameter (e.g., 1 minute, 30 seconds, etc.) to indicate a time duration which captured TC frames are to be provided to the user.  For example, as previously described, the time window of TC frames captured by TCDC 110 may be the same or
different from a time window of TC frames from which the user wishes to review.  Additionally, or alternatively, according to an exemplary embodiment, the TC frame capture request may include a timestamp parameter to indicate when the TC frame capture
request was generated or received by TCDN interface device 135, remote device 140, etc. Additionally, or alternatively, according to an exemplary embodiment, the TC frame capture request may include a TC frame/time period parameter to indicate the number
of TC frames or density of TC frames within a time period or time window (e.g., 3 TC frames/per second, 10 TC frames per second, etc.).  Additionally, or alternatively, according to an exemplary embodiment, the TC frame capture request may include a
forward/backward parameter to indicate that the time window of TC frames captured relate to a time period before or after the timestamp parameter.  As previously described, according to other embodiments, the time window may be positioned elsewhere on a
time line relative to the timestamp parameter (e.g., the time window may include a portion of time before the timestamp and a portion of time after the timestamp, etc.).
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment, TCDN 105 may store user preferences related to TC frame capture and sharing.  For example, the user preferences may include one or more of the parameters described above relating to the TC frame capture
request.  Alternatively, according to an exemplary embodiment, TCDN 105 may provide pre-defined values for one or more of the parameters described above relating to the TC frame capture request.  As will be described further below, other types of
parameters relating to the sharing of TC frames may be implemented as user preferences and/or as pre-defined by TCDN 105.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3B, TCFC 110 may capture TC frames.  According to an exemplary embodiment, TCFC 110 may continuously capture TC frames without regard to receiving a TC frame capture request.  The time window of TC frames captured may be, for
example, predefined by TCDN 105, based on user preferences, or some combination thereof.  Additionally, the number of TC frames/time window may be pre-defined by TCDN 105, based on user preferences, or some combination thereof.  According to an exemplary
embodiment, TCFC 110 may select a time window of captured TC frames and the number TC frames to store based on receiving the TC frame capture request.  TCFC 110 may store the captured TC frames responsive to the TC frame capture request in storage 115
and/or on a device (e.g. TCDN interface device 135, remote device 140, etc.) in customer premises 125.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment, a TC frame capture response may be sent from TCDN 105 to the user via TCDN interface device 135.  For example, the TC frame capture response may include television content (e.g., a GUI) that allows the user
to review the captured TC frames, select from the captured TC frames, and select destinations for selected TC frames.  According to an exemplary embodiment, the GUI may allow the user to manage the storing of the captured TC frames (e.g., naming folders,
etc.).  Additionally, or alternatively, according to an exemplary embodiment, the GUI may label each TC frame (e.g., by number or some other identifier).  Additionally, or alternatively, according to an exemplary embodiment, the GUI may include a
timeline and a marker in which the marker indicates where on the timeline a particular TC frame that the user is viewing corresponds.  Additionally, or alternatively, according to an exemplary embodiment, the GUI may include various icons, menus, or
other objects to select destinations, communication addresses, Internet sites, etc.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3C, according to an exemplary embodiment, the user may select TC frame(s) and destination(s) for the TC frame(s) in which such information may be sent to TCDN 105 (e.g., TCFC 110, etc.).  According to other embodiments,
although not illustrated, selection of TC frame(s) information and/or destination(s) for the TC frame(s) information may not be sent to TCDN 105.  For example, remote device 140 and/or TCDN interface device 135 may receive TC frame selection information
and/or destination selection information and send the TC frame(s) to the appropriate destination(s).
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 3D, the selected TC frame(s) may be sent to various destinations.  For example, according to an exemplary embodiment, TC frame sharing device 120 may manage the sharing of TC frames selected by the user.  By way of
example, the selected TC frames may be sent to Internet sites, sent to various individuals as an e-mail or text message (e.g., MMS message, etc.), or sent to other users (e.g., subscribers of the TSP).  According to some embodiments, TCDN 105 may include
one or more types of communication servers (e.g., e-mail servers, MMS servers, etc.) for its users.  According to other embodiments, the communication servers may be outside of TCDN 105.
<br/><br/> As previously described, according to an exemplary embodiment, TC frame sharing 120 may perform various security measures to access and log into various user accounts, perform user verification, etc. TC frame sharing device 120 may perform other
processes (e.g., graphical processing), packaging of TC frames with other data (e.g., text, audio, etc.).  According to other embodiment, although not illustrated, devices in customer premises 125 may perform one or more of the functions described as
being performed by TC frame sharing device 120.
<br/><br/> Additionally, according to still other embodiments and with reference to exemplary environment 150, user device 155 or user device 155 in combination with other devices (e.g., device(s) in TCDN 105, device(s) not included in TCDN 105) may
perform processes analogous to those described herein.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary process 400 for providing TC frame capturing and sharing.
<br/><br/> Television content may be provided to a user (block 405).  For example, as previously described, TCDN 105 may provide television content to a user.  The user may view the television content on a display, such as, for example, a television, a
user device, etc.
<br/><br/> A TC frame capture request may be received (block 410).  For example, as previously described, the user may request the capturing of TC frame(s).  By way of example, the user may input a TC frame capture request via remote device 140 or user
device 155.
<br/><br/> TC frame(s) may be selected based on the TC frame capture request (block 415).  For example, as previously described, TCFC 110 may capture TC frame(s) based on the TC frame capture request.  Alternatively, user device 155 may capture TC frame(s)
based on the TC frame capture request.
<br/><br/> Captured TC frame(s) may be provided to the user (block 420).  For example, as previously described, the user may have an opportunity to review the captured TC frame(s) and select TC frame(s) to share.  Additionally, the user may have an
opportunity to select destination(s).
<br/><br/> A selection of TC frame(s) and destination(s) may be received (block 425).  For example, as previously described, the user may input the TC frame and destination selections via remote device 140 or user device 155.  The selections may be
provided to TCDN 105 (e.g., sharing device 120) or not (e.g., user device 155).
<br/><br/> The TC frame(s) selected may be sent to the selected destination(s) (block 430).  For example, as previously described, TC frame sharing device 120 or user device 155 may send the selected TC frame(s) to the appropriate destination(s).
<br/><br/> Although FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary process 400 for TC frame capturing and sharing, according to other embodiments, process 400 may include additional operations, fewer operations, and/or different operations than those illustrated in FIG.
4 and described.  Additionally, while process 400 is described with reference to exemplary devices (e.g., remote device 140, user device 155, etc.), according to other embodiments, block(s) described in process 400 may be performed by a device or
combination of devices other than those specifically mentioned.
<br/><br/> The foregoing description of embodiments provides illustration, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the embodiments to the precise form disclosed.  Accordingly, modifications to the embodiments described herein may be possible.
<br/><br/> The terms "a," "an," and "the" are intended to be interpreted to include one or more items.  Further, the phrase "based on" is intended to be interpreted as "based, at least in part, on," unless explicitly stated otherwise.  The term "and/or" is
intended to be interpreted to include any and all combinations of one or more of the associated items.
<br/><br/> In addition, while a series of blocks has been described with regard to the process illustrated in FIG. 4, the order of the blocks may be modified in other implementations.  Further, non-dependent blocks may be performed in parallel. 
Additionally, other processes described in this description may be modified and/or non-dependent operations may be performed in parallel.
<br/><br/> The embodiments described herein may be implemented in many different forms of software, firmware, and/or hardware.  For example, a process or a function may be implemented as "logic" or as a "component." This logic or this component may include
hardware (e.g., processing system 205, etc.), a combination of hardware and software (e.g., application 215), a combination of hardware and firmware, a combination of hardware, firmware, and software, or software.  The embodiments have been described
without reference to the specific software code since software can be designed to implement the embodiments based on the description herein.
<br/><br/> In the preceding specification, various embodiments have been described with reference to the accompanying drawings.  It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto, and additional embodiments may be
implemented, without departing from the broader scope of the invention as set forth in the claims that follow.  The specification and drawings are accordingly to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive.
<br/><br/> No element, act, or instruction described in the present application should be construed as critical or essential to the implementations described herein unless explicitly described as such.
