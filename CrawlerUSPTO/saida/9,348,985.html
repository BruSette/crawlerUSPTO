       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A computationally implemented method includes, but is not limited to:
     determining a behavioral fingerprint associated with a network-accessible
     user, the behavioral fingerprint providing a current status of the
     network-accessible user; and controlling one or more devices
     automatically as a function of the determined behavioral fingerprint and
     a direction received from the network-accessible user. In addition to the
     foregoing, other method aspects are described in the claims, drawings,
     and text forming a part of the present disclosure.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof.  In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise.  The illustrative
embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting.  Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.
<br/><br/> Advances in computing technologies and related technologies (e.g., visual display technology, battery technology, etc.) resulted in the development of computing devices with tremendous processing power and relatively small form factors. 
Examples of such computing devices include, for example, laptops, Netbooks, tablet computers (i.e., "slate" computers), e-readers, smartphones, and so forth.  Having a small form factor with tremendous processing power presents numerous opportunities for
developing applications that previously required desktop computers or other stationary devices.  One problem with the numerous applications available on a small form factor is that authentication becomes paramount.  For example, if an application enables
a mobile phone or a smartphone or a computing device, such as a key fob to open doors to a home, it is important to determine that the user of the device/phone/fob is the true owner.
<br/><br/> Embodiments herein are directed to enabling authentication and verification to be determined based on a behavioral fingerprint of the true owner of a device.
<br/><br/> In accordance with various embodiments, computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture are provided that can determine a level of authentication of a first user of a computing device; and in response to determining the
level of authentication, automatically enable one or more actions as a function of the level of authentication.  In various embodiments, such computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture may be implemented at the computing
device and/or a computer server networked to a computing device.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 1, the figure illustrates a computing device 10 connected via a network interface to a computer server 30 in an exemplary environment 100.  Computing device 10 is shown being operated by a first user 20.  As will be further
described herein the illustrated computing device 10 and computer server 30 may employ the computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture in accordance with various embodiments.  The computing device 10 and computer server 30,
in various embodiments, may be endowed with logic that is designed to determine a level of authentication of a user of the computing device 10, and in response to such a determination, automatically enable functions of the computing device 10.
<br/><br/> First user 20 may be the primary user, such as the owner, of the computing device 10, or could be a person given authority to use the computing device by the owner.  As discussed below, the level of authentication associated with the first user
20, whether owner or not, is determined, at least partially based on a behavioral fingerprint of the owner of computing device 10.  More particularly, a level of authentication associated with first user 20 of computing device 10 can be determined based
on a behavioral fingerprint of the owner of computing device 10.  The behavioral fingerprint of an owner of computing device 10 can be configured to be network accessible by computing device 10 via network 50 to server[s] 30.  Server[s] 30 can be a cloud
of connected network servers or can be a web server or the like.  The behavioral fingerprint of an owner/authorized user of computing device 10 can be configured to override or be a determining factor for a level of authentication associated with
computing device 10.
<br/><br/> Although the computing device 10 illustrated in FIG. 1 is depicted as being a tablet computer, in alternative embodiments, the computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture in accordance with various embodiments may
be embodied in other types of computer systems having other form factors including other types of portable computing devices such as, for example, mobile telephones, laptops, Netbooks, smartphones, e-readers, and so forth.  For example, device[s] 60
illustrate smartphones, client computers and the like as possible computing devices.  As illustrated, the computing device 10 can include a display 12, such as a touchscreen, on the front side 17a of the computing device 10.  Computing device 10 can
further include a keyboard, either as a touch input/output keyboard or as an attached keyboard.  As further depicted in FIG. 1, the display 12 displays an exemplary document 14 and a tool bar 15.  As further depicted, the computing device 10 may also
include a camera 16 (e.g., a webcam) disposed on the front side 17a of the computing device 10.  In some embodiments, additional cameras may be included on the front side 17a and/or backside of the computing device 10.
<br/><br/> The first user 20 can be an authorized user of computing device 10 or a person who has no connection to the computing device 10.  In an embodiment, a level of authentication and/or a behavioral fingerprint can be determinative of the
accessibility of computing device 10.  In an embodiment, computing device 10 determines a level of authentication of first user 20 of a computing device 10.  In an embodiment, computing device 10 uses the level of authentication to enable or disable
automatic functions of the computing device 10.  For example, computing device 10 can be configured to automatically open doors to a home, car, or other authorized user-designated item, depending on the level of authentication of the computing device at
that time.
<br/><br/> In accordance with an embodiment, the level of authentication determination relies at least in part on the behavioral fingerprint of one or more authorized users of computing device 10.  The behavioral fingerprint can be determined based on
statistical calculations on social network collected data, sensor-provided data, user input and/or a combination of such data.  Thus, the level of authentication can be affected by a behavioral fingerprint of an authorized user of computing device 10,
which may include social network collected data.  The level of authentication can also be affected by various aspects at the time computing device 10 is turned on, such as aspects surrounding computing device 10 and/or aspects of the computing device
itself (e.g., movements or detected images).  For example, when the computing device 10 of FIG. 1 is turned on by the first user 20 the first user 20 may input a password or pattern or other identifying input, such as a fingerprint, facial recognition or
the like.  Thus, the level of authentication would recognize the user as an authorized user and then determine whether a behavioral fingerprint is established for that authorized user.  Thus, the behavioral fingerprint of an authorized user can be
configured to work together to determine accessibility of computing device 10 to first user 20.  The level of authentication and the behavioral fingerprint can be directly correlated, or can be configured to enable a level of authentication to override
the behavioral fingerprint or vice versa.
<br/><br/> For example, a manufacturer of computing device 10 may be able to override a behavioral fingerprint of an authorized user of computing device 10 via the level of authentication, by entering a secret code, such as a manufacturer's accessibility
code or the like in order to perform work on computing device 10.
<br/><br/> In one or more embodiments, first user 20 can be a network-accessible user for which computing device 10 is just one of many network-accessible devices that network-accessible user 20 may use to access the internet, a cloud server, a mobile
network or the like.  A network-accessible user can be an owner and/or operator of computing device 10 and other devices.  According to an embodiment, network-accessible user 20 can have a behavioral fingerprint that exists outside of computing device
10, that can exist in a cloud computing system for which servers 30 are connected.  Devices 30 can further have a presence in the cloud computing system to enable the embodiments described herein.  For example, each of devices 30 can be a
network-accessible device to which network-accessible user 20 could be connected.  Thus, network-accessible user 20 could be a user of one or several devices simultaneously.  Network-accessible user 20 could also be a user of a public computing device,
for example, if none of devices 30 are available to network-accessible user 20.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 2a, computing device 10 of FIG. 1 illustrates a level of authentication module 102, an access restricting module 104, a behavioral fingerprint module 106, an alert generating module 108, a memory 114 (which may store one or
more applications 160 and/or a library of behavioral fingerprints 170), one or more processors 116 (e.g., microprocessors, controllers, etc.), one or more sensors 120, a user interface 110 (e.g., a display monitor such as a touchscreen, a keypad, a
mouse, a microphone, a speaker, etc.), and a network interface 112 (e.g., network interface card or NIC).
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, the level of authentication module 102 of FIG. 2a is a logic module that is designed to determine a level of authentication associated with first user 20 of computing device 10.  The access restricting module 104 is a
logic module that is designed to restrict access to one or more items in response to the determination made by the level of authentication module 102.  Alert generating module 108 is a logic module that is designed to generate an alert that causes the
computing device 10 to communicate a variance to the level of authentication module to restrict capabilities of the computing device and access to the one or more items.  The computing device 10 of FIG. 1, can include the three logic modules (e.g., the
level of authentication module 102, the restriction module 104, and the alert generating module 108) using circuitry including components such as application specific integrated circuit or ASIC.  Alternatively, logic modules including a level of
authentication module 102/102a, access restricting module 104/104a, behavioral fingerprint module 106/106a and alert generating module 108/108a can provide the same and similar functionality and correspond to level of authentication module 102, the
access restricting module 104, behavioral fingerprint module 106 and the alert generating module 108.  Logic modules level of authentication module 102a, the behavioral fingerprint module 106a, the access restricting module 104a, and the alert generating
module 108a of the computing device 10 of FIG. 2a can be implemented by the one or more processors 116 executing computer readable instructions 152 (e.g., software and/or firmware) that may be stored in the memory 114.
<br/><br/> Note that although FIG. 2a illustrates all of the logic modules (e.g., the level of authentication module 102, the access restricting module 104, the behavioral fingerprint module 106 and the alert generating module 108) being implemented using
purely circuitry components such as ASIC, logic modules 102, 102a, 104, 104a, 106, 106a, 108, and 108a may be implemented using a combination of specifically designed circuitry such as ASIC and one or more processors 116 (or other types of circuitry such
as field programmable gate arrays or FPGAs) executing computer readable instructions 152.  For example, in some embodiments, at least one of the logic modules may be implemented using specially designed circuitry (e.g., ASIC) while a second logic module
may be implemented using a processor 116 (or other types of programmable circuitry such as an FPGA) executing computer readable instructions 152 (e.g., software and/or firmware).  System requirements could dictate a combination of software and firmware
and circuitry to meet the embodiments herein, for example, logic modules could be designed to use the most efficient combination of software/hardware/firmware in order to quickly implement methods and systems within the scope of the present disclosure.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, the memory 114 of the computing device 10 of FIG. 2a may comprise of one or more of mass storage device, read-only memory (ROM), programmable read-only memory (PROM), erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), cache
memory such as random access memory (RAM), flash memory, synchronous random access memory (SRAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and/or other types of memory devices.  In various embodiments the one or more applications 160 stored in memory 114 may
include, for example, an operating system 162, one or more productivity applications 164 such as a word processing application or a spreadsheet application, one or more communication applications 166 such as an email or IM application, and one or more
personal information manager applications 168 (e.g., Microsoft.RTM.  Outlook.TM.) and one or more social network applications such as Twitter.TM.  and Facebook.TM..
<br/><br/> Turning now to FIG. 2b illustrating a particular implementation of the level of authentication module 102 and 102a of FIG. 2a.  As illustrated, the level of authentication module 102 and 102a may include one or more sub-logic modules in various
alternative implementations.  For example, in various implementations, the level of authentication module 102/102a may include a behavioral fingerprint interaction module 210, which may further include anomalous action detecting module 212, and a social
network confirmation module 216.  Level of authentication module 102/102a may further include statistical level determination module 218, a visual cue detecting module 220, including face detecting module 222, and an audio cue detecting module 226,
including a voice pattern detecting module 227.  Level of authentication module 102/102a may also include a geographic location determination module 230.
<br/><br/> The behavioral fingerprint catalogue or library of anomalous actions may be stored as part of behavioral fingerprint library 170 stored in memory 114 (see FIG. 2a) of the computing device 10 of FIG. 1.  Therefore, when anomalous changes that
match with catalogued or a library of anomalous changes (e.g., as stored in library 170 of the memory 114) have been detected, then at least an inference may be made that the user of computing device 10 is not authenticated, that first user 20 is not an
owner of computing device 10, or the like.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the computing device 10 may include logic that is designed to determine data from a combination of sensors 120 (e.g., of FIG. 2d) that may be processed and analyzed.  In some embodiments, computing device 10 determines via
one or more image capturing devices 204 (e.g., webcam or digital camera), and/or one or more audio capturing devices 206 (e.g., microphones), and/or images received by computing device via one or more networked devices and/or social networks, whether the
computing device 10 is no longer under the control of first user 20, which would cause the level of authentication determined in level of authentication module 102 to alter.  For example, the computing device 10 in some cases may employ one or more
movement sensors 202 to detect the actual movements of the computing device 10 and/or one or more image capturing devices 204 (possibly including a facial recognition system/application) to determine that a face associated with the first user 20 is not a
face associated with an owner of computing device 10.  Based on the data provided by both the movement sensors 202 and/or the image capturing devices 204 at least an inference may be made that the computing device 10 requires an alteration to the level
of authentication.
<br/><br/> Alternatively or additionally, in some embodiments, the computing device 10 may be endowed with a facial recognition system (e.g., facial recognition software) that when employed with one or more image capturing devices 204 may be used in order
to determine the presence or absence of a face associated with an owner of computing device 10 and compare to the first user 20.  If the face associated with the owner of computing device 10 does not match first user 20 then a determination may be made
to alter the level of authentication associated with first user 20.  In addition to face recognition, other logic can include using the field of view of image capturing device 16 or audio capturing devices of the computing device 10 to identify an
authorized user of computing device through other recognition processes, such as fingerprint, retina, voice verification, global positioning system (GPS) locating of the owner of computing device 10 or other personal identification.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, the one or more items that access may be restricted to may be one or more electronic items that may have been open or running prior to a level of authentication change of the computing device 10 and/or electronic items
that were accessible through the computing device 10 (e.g., electronic documents and files that were stored in the computing device 10) prior to an alteration of the level of authentication of the computing device 10.
<br/><br/> Statistical level determination module 218 may be configured to apply statistical algorithms, comparative analysis, statistical probability functions, and the like to determine a statistical level of authentication for computing device 10.  In
one embodiment, statistical level determination module 218 may apply a weighting function, which determines a level of authentication based on received data from scanners, and other devices, and a behavioral fingerprint, with each received data having a
predetermined weight regarding relevance to authentication.  Statistical level determination module 218 may additionally or alternatively analyze anomalous actions to determine or infer the level of authentication.  To further determine or at least infer
that the computing device 10 should have a low level of authentication, statistical examination/analysis of the detected anomalous action movements of the computing device 10 may involve comparing the detected anomalies of the computing device 10 with
catalogued or library anomalous action movements (which may be stored in the memory 114 of the computing device 10) that are identified as being movements associated with, for example, a transfer of computing device 10, a dropping of computing device 10,
an action incompatible with the stored predicted actions of an authorized user, or an alert received from a social network that an expected or previously possessory authorized user does not have possession of computing device 10.
<br/><br/> Computing device 10 may maintain in its memory 114 (see FIG. 2A) a behavioral fingerprint library 170 that may include a catalogue or library of actions, inputs, movements, received network data including anomalous data that have been previously
identified as anomalous that may occur when, for example, a computing device 10 is stolen or used by another user, or a social network query fails to return appropriate confirmatory data that confirms that an authorized user is in control of computing
device 10.  Thus, when anomalous movements, inputs or actions match something in the library anomalous movements, inputs or actions have been detected, a determination or inference may be made that the level of authentication must be altered.  The level
of authentication can be lowered, such that first user 20 is determined to have a lowest level of authentication.
<br/><br/> Behavioral fingerprint interaction module 210 may receive data from behavior fingerprint module 106/106a and/or behavioral fingerprint library 170.  Behavioral fingerprint interaction module 210 can apply the data relating to one or more
behavioral fingerprints of authorized users to determine a level of authentication.  More particularly, level of authentication module 102/102a may be configured to receive a behavioral fingerprint as a list of activities, warnings, anomalous actions,
and the like.  Specific details related to the level of authentication module 102/102a as well as the above-described sub-modules of the level of authentication module 102 will be provided below with respect to the operations and processes to be
described herein.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 2c illustrating a particular implementation of the access restricting module 104/104a of FIG. 2a.  Access restricting module 104/104a of the computing device 10 of FIG. 2c can be configured to restrict access (e.g., hiding
or disguising, denying viewing or editorial access, converting to read-only form, and so forth) via the computing device 10 to one or more items (e.g., documents, image or audio files, passwords, applications, and so forth) or preventing one or more
actions by computing device 10.
<br/><br/> As illustrated, the access restricting module 104/104a may include one or more sub-logic modules in various alternative implementations.  For example, in various implementations, the access restricting module 104/104a may include a partial
access providing module 232, a no access module 234, a viewing access restricting module 236 (which may further include a visual hiding module 237 that may further include a visual replacing module 238), an audio access restricting module 240 (which may
further include an audio hiding module 241 that may further include an audio replacing module 242), an editorial restricted format presenting module 245, a functional restricting format presenting module 250, an open item ascertaining module 252, a
document access restricting module 254 (which may further include a productivity document access restricting module 255, a message access restricting module 256, an image document access restricting module 257, and/or an audio document access restricting
module 258), and/or a password access restricting module 262.  As further illustrated in FIG. 2c, the access restricting module 104/104a, in various implementations, may also include an application access restriction module 264 (which may further include
a productivity application access restriction module 265, a communication application access restriction module 266, and/or a personal information manager application access restriction module 267), and/or an affiliation ascertaining module 270.  As
further illustrated in FIG. 2c, in various implementations, the affiliation ascertaining module 270 may further include one or more sub-modules including an identifier affiliation ascertaining module 271 (which may further include a name affiliation
ascertaining module 272, an image affiliation ascertaining module 273, and/or a voice pattern affiliation ascertaining module 274), an address ascertaining module 276, a source ascertaining module 277, and/or a word/phrase/number affiliation ascertaining
module 278.
<br/><br/> An example of how access restricting module 104/104a operates includes determining whether one or more productivity documents are word processing documents and then restricting access to such items may involve hiding or disguising
representations of the documents in a directory (e.g., deleting document names or subject headings in the directory or replacing the document names or subject headings in the directory with pseudo-names or subject headings).  Alternatively, a
non-editable form of the documents may be presented in order to restrict access to such documents.  If, on the other hand, the one or more items are one or more software applications, then restricting access to such items may involve denying use of one
or more functionalities associated with the items (e.g., applications).  For example, if the one or more items include a word processing application, then restricting access to such an application may involve, although allowing general access to such an
application, disabling one or more editing functions of the application.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2d illustrates the various types of sensors 120 that may be included with the computing device 10 of FIG. 1.  As illustrated, the sensors 120 that may be included with the computing device 10 may include one or more movement sensors 202,
one or more image capturing devices 204 (e.g., a web cam, a digital camera, etc.), one or more audio capturing devices 206 (e.g., microphones), and/or a global positioning system (GPS) 208 (which may include any device that can determine its geographic
location including those devices that determine its geographic location using triangulation techniques applied to signals transmitted by satellites or by communication towers such as cellular towers).
<br/><br/> One way to monitor actions taken by first user 20 with respect to computing device 10 is to directly detect such actions using one or more sensors shown in FIG. 2d that are designed to directly detect/measure activities by user 20 of computing
device 10.  These sensors can be integrated with computing device 10 and may be used to directly detect the action taken with respect to the computing device 10 as the computing device 10 is being used by first user 20.  For example, fingerprint
detection sensor, or facial recognition sensors can detect whether first user 20 is an authorized user of computing device 10.  Once first user 20 is associated with an authorized user of computing device 10, the behavioral fingerprint associated with
the associated authorized user can be accessed.  The behavioral fingerprint module 106/106a then can process data received by behavioral fingerprint library 170, and provide the behavioral fingerprint data to level of authentication module 102.  In one
embodiment, level of authentication module 102 receives the behavioral fingerprint data from behavioral fingerprint library 170 and determines the accessibility of computing device 10 based at least in part on the determined behavioral fingerprint.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 2e, computer server 30 of FIG. 1 can include similar functionality to computing device 10.  As such, FIG. 2e illustrates a level of authentication module 102c, an access restricting module 104c, a behavioral fingerprint
module 106c, an alert generating module 108c, a memory 114c (which may store one or more applications 160c and a library of behavioral fingerprints 170c), one or more processors 116c (e.g., microprocessors, controllers, etc.), and a network interface
112c (e.g., network interface card or NIC).
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, logic modules level of authentication module 102c, the behavioral fingerprint module 106c, the access restricting module 104c, and the alert generating module 108c of the computer server 30 of FIG. 2e can be implemented
by the one or more processors 116c executing computer readable instructions (e.g., software and/or firmware) that may be stored in the memory 114.
<br/><br/> Note that FIG. 2e illustrates the logic modules (e.g., the level of authentication module 102c, the access restricting module 104c, the behavioral fingerprint module 106c and the alert generating module 108c) being implemented using processor
modules, however, purely circuitry components such as an ASIC may be implemented using a combination of specifically designed circuitry such as ASIC and one or more processors 116c (or other types of circuitry such as field programmable gate arrays or
FPGAs) executing computer readable instructions.  For example, in some embodiments, at least one of the logic modules may be implemented using specially designed circuitry (e.g., ASIC) while a second logic module may be implemented using a processor 116c
(or other types of programmable circuitry such as an FPGA) executing computer readable instructions (e.g., software and/or firmware).  System requirements could dictate a combination of software and firmware and circuitry to meet the embodiments herein,
for example, logic modules could be designed to use the most efficient combination of software/hardware/firmware in order to quickly implement methods and systems within the scope of the present disclosure.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, the memory 114c of the computer server 30 of FIG. 2e may comprise of one or more of mass storage device, read-only memory (ROM), programmable read-only memory (PROM), erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), cache
memory such as random access memory (RAM), flash memory, synchronous random access memory (SRAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and/or other types of memory devices.  In various embodiments the one or more applications 160c stored in memory 114c
may include, for example, an operating system 162c, one or more productivity applications 164c such as a word processing application or a spreadsheet application, or one or more communication applications 166c.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 3a, behavioral fingerprint library 170 (and 170c) is shown with more particularity.  Computing device 10 and computer server 30 may maintain in its memory 114/114c (see FIG. 2a and FIG. 2e) a behavioral fingerprint library
170/170c (see also, FIG. 2a and FIG. 2e), which is a catalog or library that identifies a plurality of actions by one or more users, including network interactions, including social network interactions, alerts relating to one or more users and the like
that when detected as occurring at least infers (e.g., implies) that computing device 10 is being used by an authorized user.  FIG. 3a includes modules and functionalities that can be performed by either or both of computing device 10 and/or computer
server 30.  In the case of computer server 30, the functionalities of the various modules can be replicated as needed for a plurality of computer devices and authorized users of one or more computer devices, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary
skill in the art.  For example, computer server 30 can be one of a computer farm, such as may exist in a cloud computing setting, and enable productivity applications 164c and communications applications 166c to be performed via cloud computing
technologies.  As such appropriate replications can be included within the scope of the present application.
<br/><br/> As shown, FIG. 3a includes a social network library 302, authorized user library 304, anomalous activity library 306 and cryptographic library 308.
<br/><br/> Social network library 302 can be configured to store interactions between authorized users and other entities.  For example, one or more social networks could include Facebook.TM.  and/or Twitter.TM..  Social network library 302 can be
configured to store messages from one or more social networks such that behavioral fingerprint module 106/106a can determine if action needs to be taken based on the messages.  For example, an authorized user of computing device 10 and/or another device
via computer server 30, or over network 50 could post a message via a social network that computing device 10 is no longer under his/her control.  Computing device 10 could automatically receive such a post over a network connection, from computer server
30 via network interface 112/112c, to social network library 302, which would create a low level of authentication to first user 20, possibly before first user 20 attempts to use computing device 10.  A higher level of authentication would need to be
reestablished by an authorized user of computing device 10 after return of possession of the computing device 10 for an authorized user to have full functionality of computing device 10 or to restore a prior level of authentication or the like.
<br/><br/> Social network library 302 can identify any messages with indicative aspects relative to authentication.  Network library 302 can be configured to identify key words, such as "stolen" or "lost" and pass on a warning notification to behavioral
fingerprint module and/or level of authentication module for further processing.  In one embodiment, network library 302 can apply a search algorithm to identify key words to assist in determining behaviors that are both authentication positive and
authentication negative.  For example, "stolen", "lost" are authentication negative key words.  Conversely, a current message from a current "friend" on Facebook.TM.  and a response using computing device 10 would be authentication positive.  Any
indications that an authorized user of computing device 10 is interacting with previously verified and identified "friends" on Facebook.TM.  would be authentication positive.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3a also includes authorized user library 304, which can include a library of authorized users of computing device 10.  Computing device 10 and computer server 30 can be associated with one or more authorized users.  The authorized users can
include an owner or several owners, co-owners, and users with varying degree of permission for using computing device 10 or other computer devices.  Authorized user library 304 can include profiles for each authorized user, including passwords.  Behavior
fingerprint module 106/106a/106c and level of authentication module 102/102a/102c can be associated with one or more authorized users, or associated with just one authorized user, in accordance with system requirements.  For example, each authorized user
can have a designated behavioral fingerprint.  When first user 20 is identified as one of a plurality of authorized users, the behavioral fingerprint for that authorized user would be associated with first user 20, and a level of authentication can be
then determined.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3a further illustrates anomalous activity library 306.  Anomalous activity library 306 can include data stored that indicates an anomalous activity has taken place.  In one embodiment, an authorized user can store or log activities that the
user has predetermined to be anomalous.  For example, an authorized user may provide a list of area codes for which the computing device operated as a phone, would consider anomalous.  A list could include all foreign country phone numbers, specific area
codes or the like that the authorized user would not normally call from computing device 10.  An authorized user could further identify actions that would be anomalous for that authorized user.  Identified action could include time of day usage,
GPS-determined locations identified as locations of computing device 10 the authorized user considered anomalous, and application-specific actions identified as anomalous.  An example of application-specific actions could include deletion of significant
amounts of data, logging into a social network as a user that is not an authorized user of computing device 10, and the like.  In an embodiment, anomalous activity library 306 further logs activities that are received upon via a network that are
determined to be anomalous.  For example, a social networked entity can post a message that is monitored by computing device 10 and/or computer server 30 that includes a warning or other indication of unsafe conditions associated with computing device
10.  Anomalous activity library 306 could be configured to log the warning so that the behavioral fingerprint module can determine whether to associate the warning with an authorized user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3a further illustrates cryptographic library 308, which can include data such as passwords, public/private key pair data, cryptographic keys such as the types used in block ciphers such as Triple DES or substitution permutation algorithms
like AES.  As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, Triple DES data is encrypted with the first key, decrypted with the second key, and finally encrypted again with the third key, resulting in up to a 168 bit encryption.  AES encryption can
use variable key lengths.  For example, keys used in AES can have lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits to encrypt blocks with a length of 128, 192 or 256 bits (all nine combinations of key length and block length are possible).  As will be appreciated by
those of skill in the art with the benefit of the present application, key lengths can change over time as computing capabilities change and progress.  As such, the key lengths described herein are exemplary only and not intended to be limiting in any
way.  Cryptographic library 308 can receive data from social networks or designated sources to create a key pair or to regenerate a key or key pair.  For example, as part of an authorized user's behavioral fingerprint, the authorized user could assign
parts of a key, either asymmetric or symmetric, to several "friends" on a social network.  In the current state of the art, an asymmetric key could be a "public key" and would not need to be kept secret, and a symmetric key could be a "private key" or a
"secret" which would need to be protected.  For purposes of the present application, in embodiments presented herein, the terms "asymmetric key," "public key," and "private key" contemplate possible changes in cryptography algorithms for which different
types of asymmetric keys could require protection.  Furthermore, embodiments herein contemplate the re-emergence and/or generation of cryptography systems wherein cryptographic keys may be made public and the specific cryptographic algorithms used to
generate cryptographic keys may need to be kept secret.  For example, in an attempt to thwart piracy, some computer gaming software systems now execute certain security code(s) on a remote server instead of the local device.  In this case, the data may
be known, but the code implementing the algorithm is kept secret.  The use of the terms asymmetric, public, and private should not be interpreted as restricted to the current form of public/private key pair encryption, but rather to the general case of
establishing a means of secure communication with some aspect being kept secret.  For example, key encryption may be either symmetrical or asymmetrical, with some aspect being known.  If an anomalous event occurs which causes the authorized user's
behavioral fingerprint to be compromised, an authorized user can reestablish a behavioral fingerprint by notifying each designated "friend" in the social network to send a portion of the key, so that when the key is regenerated, the behavioral
fingerprint is rebuilt.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3b, behavioral fingerprint module 106/106a is shown in more detail.  Behavioral fingerprint module 106/106a receives data from behavioral fingerprint library 170.  Behavioral fingerprint module 106/106a is shown including
initialization module 312, fingerprint build/degradation module 314, and fingerprint generation module 316.
<br/><br/> Initialization module 312 may be configured to determine an initial behavioral fingerprint associated with an authorized user.  The initial behavioral fingerprint can be based on entered data by authorized user, and received data from behavioral
fingerprint library 170 and received data from sensor[s] 120.
<br/><br/> Fingerprint build/degradation module 314 may be configured to determine whether initial behavioral fingerprint should be altered due to received data from behavioral fingerprint library 170, or sensor[s] 120.
<br/><br/> Fingerprint generation module 316 may be configured to determine a current behavioral fingerprint for a first user 20 determined to be an authorized user attempting to operate computing device 10.  Fingerprint generation module 316 can also be
configured to determine a behavioral fingerprint for an established authorized user based on network received data while computing device 10 is connected to a network connection.  In the case of fingerprint generation module 316 existing in a cloud
computing setting or computer server 30, fingerprint generation module 316 may be configured to determine a network-based behavioral fingerprint for a plurality of users when first logging into network 50 or cloud computing logging to computer server 30.
<br/><br/> A behavioral fingerprint can be determined before first user 20 handles computing device 10.  In some embodiments, a manufacturer can set both a behavioral fingerprint and a level of authentication based on information received by first user 20
when ordering computing device 10 or first handling computing device 10.  For example, received passwords and the like.  In a computer server 30 environment, a behavioral fingerprint can be transferred from another device, such as devices 60.  Whether
the level of authentication or the behavioral fingerprint controls the accessibility and actions available to first user 20 depends on system requirements and can be adjusted.  For example, a behavioral fingerprint may indicate that computing device 20
has been stolen, and, in such a case, the behavioral fingerprint library 170 could be configured to notify level of authentication module 102 of exigent circumstances requiring a reduced access to computing device 10.  Likewise, computer server 30 could
hold the behavioral fingerprint library 170c and notify a level of authentication module 102 and 102c of exigent circumstances.
<br/><br/> Also, a behavioral fingerprint module 106/106a/106c may be configured to rebuild some type of asymmetric key pair or a Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard) or AES (Advanced Encryption System) type key after an anomalous event, and notify level
of authentication module that an authorized user should have a level of authentication that allows access.
<br/><br/> Behavioral fingerprint module 106/106a/106c can receive data related to various types of movements, actions and inputs related to computing device 10.  For example, an initial behavioral fingerprint generated by behavioral fingerprint module
106/106a/106c could be configured to communicate to level of authentication logic module 102/102a/102c predetermined inputs to computing device 10 and/or computer server 30 to provide access.
<br/><br/> Other examples of the type of movements, actions and inputs that may be tracked for purposes of determining a behavioral fingerprint may include, for example, individually or in combination, those tracked using one or more sensors 120 that may
be included with the computing device 10 as illustrated in FIG. 2d.  For example, in various embodiments, one or more movement sensors 202 can directly detect movements, and/or other types of sensors (e.g., image capturing devices 204, audio capturing
devices 206, etc.) that may be able to indirectly detect actions may be employed to confirm actions taken with respect to the computing device 10 as will be further described herein.  Another type of sensor can determine a particular way in which the
first user types on a keyboard of the computing device or uses pressure on the computing device.  For example, a first user may repetitively use particular keys with a particular pressure or the like.  The key pattern could be used in behavioral
fingerprint module 106/106a to build on a behavioral fingerprint as in fingerprint build/degradation module 314, for example.
<br/><br/> The type of access to be restricted in response to determining that the computing device 10 or computer server 30 has an altered level of authentication for first user 20 will depend on a number of factors including what types of actions are
requested.  For example, if the one or more items are one or more software applications (herein "applications"), then the access restriction may include restriction to one or more functionalities of the one or more applications.  Alternatively, access
restriction and disabling of the one or more applications in some cases may mean access to the one or more applications being completely blocked or hidden.  In contrast, if the one or more items are one or more electronic documents (e.g., productivity
documents, image or audio files, etc.), then the access restriction that may be applied to such items may relate to editorial access restrictions (e.g., restrictions to the modifications, deletion, addition, and so forth of the items) of the items as a
function of the level of authentication.  Likewise, automatic actions and tasks may be restricted or disabled as a function of the level of authentication and/or the behavioral fingerprint.
<br/><br/> In some cases, restricting access to the one or more items may mean restricting viewing access to the one or more items while in other cases it may mean restricting audio access to the one or more items.  In some cases, restricting access to the
one or more items may mean complete restriction to access of the one or more items and/or one or more actions, while in other cases, restricting access to the one or more items may mean only a partial restriction to access of the one or more items.  In
any event, a more detailed discussion related to the various types of access restrictions that may be applied to the one or more items will be provided below with respect to the operations and processes to be described herein.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the computing device 10 in response to restricting access to the one or more items and preventing one or more automatic actions, may be designed to generate an alert that indicates that the computing device 10 has been
reconfigured to restrict access to the one or more items and disable the one or more automatic actions.  Note that in some embodiments, the alert can go back and forth between computer server 30 and computing device 10, depending on the source of the
alert and the exigency of the alert.
<br/><br/> A more detailed discussion related to the computing device 10 of FIGS. 1-3 will now be provided with respect to the processes and operations to be described herein.  FIG. 4 illustrates an operational flow 400 representing example operations for,
among other things, restricting access via a computing device to one or more items (e.g., software applications, electronic documents including productivity documents, audio or image files, electronic messages including emails, passwords, and so forth). 
In FIG. 4 and in the following figures that include various examples of operational flows, discussions and explanations will be provided with respect to the exemplary environment 100 described above and as illustrated in FIG. 1 and/or with respect to
other examples (e.g., as provided in FIG. 2a) and contexts.  However, it should be understood that the operational flows may be executed in a number of other environments and contexts, and/or in modified versions of FIGS. 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, and FIGS. 3a and
3b.  Also, although the various operational flows are presented in the sequence(s) illustrated, it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders other than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently.
<br/><br/> Further, in FIG. 4 and in the figures to follow thereafter, various operations may be depicted in a box-within-a-box manner.  Such depictions may indicate that an operation in an internal box may comprise an optional example embodiment of the
operational step illustrated in one or more external boxes.  However, it should be understood that internal box operations may be viewed as independent operations separate from any associated external boxes and may be performed in any sequence with
respect to all other illustrated operations, or may be performed concurrently.  Still further, these operations illustrated in FIG. 4 as well as the other operations to be described herein are performed by at least one of a machine, an article of
manufacture, or a composition of matter unless indicated otherwise.
<br/><br/> In any event, after a start operation, the operational flow 400 of FIG. 4 may move to an association operation 402 for determining that a first user of a computing device is associated with the computing device.  For instance, and as an
illustration, the level of authentication module 102/102a of the computing device 10 of FIG. 1 determining that a computing device 10 used by a first user 20 (e.g., an unknown user having inferior access rights or an authorized user of the computing
device 10 of FIG. 1) has turned on and/or logged onto computing device 10.  Note that in various implementations, the first user 20 may use the computing device 10 by logging onto the computing device 10 and/or by employing the computing device 10 to
access one or more applications and/or content that may be accessible through the computing device 10.  In addition to the association operation 402, operational flow 400 may also include a level of authentication operation 404 for determining a level of
authentication associated with the first user via the computing device, the level of authentication at least partially based on a behavioral fingerprint as further illustrated in FIG. 4.  For instance, level of authentication module 102/102a determining
a level of authentication for first user 20.  The level of authentication can be configured to restrict access to the one or more items/actions as a function of the level of authentication assigned to first user 20.  If first user 20 is identified as an
authorized user, level of authentication module 102/102a can be configured to take into account a behavioral fingerprint associated with that authorized user.
<br/><br/> In addition to level of authentication operation 404, operational flow 400 includes operation 406, determining via the computing device that the first user has made a request for performance of a task, for example, computing device 10 user
interface 110 receiving an input from first user 10 to access an application 160 or the like.  Operation 406 is followed by operation 408, performing the task automatically without interference by the first user as a function of the level of
authentication of the first user.  For instance, the level of authentication module 102/102a of the computing device 10 of FIG. 1 determining automatically without interference (e.g., without prompting) that first user 20 is an authorized user and
activating one of applications 160 to perform a task automatically.
<br/><br/> As will be further described herein, the level of authentication operation 404 of FIG. 4 may be executed in a variety of different ways in various alternative implementations.  FIGS. 5a, 5b, 5c, for example, illustrate at least some of the
alternative ways that operation 404 of FIG. 4 may be executed in various alternative implementations.  For example, in various implementations, operation 404 of FIG. 4 may include an operation 502 for determining the behavioral fingerprint via
establishing a statistical predictability of one or more future actions of an authorized user of the computing device as depicted in FIG. 5a.  For instance, behavioral fingerprint module 106/106a determining a behavioral fingerprint of first user 20 by
establishing that first user 20 is an authorized user of computing device 10, and generating a behavioral fingerprint via fingerprint build/degradation module 314 and fingerprint generation module 316, which can include statistical calculations based on
prior actions to predict future actions of an authorized user.
<br/><br/> As further illustrated in FIG. 5a, in some implementations, the level of authentication operation 502 may additionally or alternatively include an operation 503 for sensing the one or more actions of the authorized user.  For instance, sensors
120 and level of authentication module 102/102a of the computing device 10 of FIG. 1 determining that first user 20 is an authorized user based, at least in part, on data provided by one or more sensors 120.
<br/><br/> Data from various types of sensors 120 may be used in order to determine a level of authentication of the computing device 10.  For example, and as further illustrated in FIG. 5a, operation 503 may be followed by an operation 504 applying a
statistical value to the sensed one or more actions of the authorized user to establish the statistical predictability of one or more future actions of the authorized user.  For instance, the level of authentication module 102/102a of the computing
device 10 of FIG. 1 applying statistical level determination module 218 to actions taken by an authorized user with a behavioral fingerprint via sensors 120, and behavioral fingerprint library 170.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, operation 504 may include an operation 505 for storing the sensed one or more actions of the authorized user as further depicted in FIG. 5a.  For instance, memory 114, including library of behavioral fingerprints 170 of
the computing device 10 of FIG. 1 storing one or more actions sensed by sensors 120 and actions over a network, such as social network interactions.
<br/><br/> In the same or different implementations, operation 505 may include an operation 506 for detecting the one or more actions of the authorized user wherein the one or more actions of the authorized user include logging into one or more social
networks.  For instance, the level of authentication module 102/102a of the computing device 10 of FIG. 1 determining that first user 20 is operating computing device 10 as an authorized user and communication application 166 running a social network
application with data being stored in behavioral fingerprint library 170.
<br/><br/> In the same or alternative implementations, operation 503 may include an operation 507 for detecting one or more keystrokes on the computing device to determine a pattern of use associated with the authorized user.  For instance, the level of
authentication module 102/102a of the computing device 10 of FIG. 1 detecting via movement sensors 202 one or more keystrokes on computing device 10 to determine a pattern of use associated with an authorized user.
<br/><br/> Operations 503 may also include an operation 508 for detecting one or more manners for swiping input on the computing device to determine a pattern of use associated with the authorized user as depicted in FIG. 5a.  For instance, the level of
authentication module 102/102a of the computing device 10 of FIG. 1 detecting via movement sensors 202 manners of swiping an input on computing device 10 to determine a pattern of use associated with an authorized user.
<br/><br/> Operations 503 may also include an operation 509 for detecting one or more contacts frequently visited by the authorized user on the computing device to determine a visitation pattern associated with the authorized user as depicted in FIG. 5a. 
For instance, level of authentication module 102/102a of the computing device 10 of FIG. 1 detecting via social network library 302 a visitation pattern associated with an authorized user.
<br/><br/> In some cases, operation 503 may, in turn, include an operation 510, which provides for comparing a stored image of the authorized user to a detected image of the first user via a camera connected to the computing device.  For instance,
computing device 10 using behavioral fingerprint library 170, authorized user library 304 to store an image of an authorized user, and level of authentication module 102/102a and/or behavior fingerprint module 106/106a comparing the stored image of the
authorized user with a received image of first user 20 via sensors 120, such as image capturing device 204.
<br/><br/> Referring to operation 504, operation 504 can include operation 511 altering the level of authentication of the first user as a function of the statistical predictability of the one or more future actions of the authorized user.  For instance,
computing device 10 altering a level of authentication using level of authentication module 102/102a as a function of a statistical probability determined via statistical level determination module 218 to determine one or more future actions of the
authorize user.
<br/><br/> In the same or different implementations, operation 511 may include an operation 512 for lowering the level of authentication of the first user when the one or more actions of the first user includes a detected anomalous action as further
depicted in FIG. 5a.  For instance, the anomalous action detecting module 212 of the computing device 10 detecting an anomalous action with respect to computing device 10 during use of the computing device 10 by the first user 20, and causing level of
authentication module 102/102a to lower the level of authentication with respect to first user 20.
<br/><br/> In various implementations, the operation 512 for lowering the level of authentication of the first user when the one or more actions of the first user includes a detected anomalous action may include operation 513 for detecting that the first
user has performed an action uncharacteristic of the authorized user and/or that the first user has performed an action previously identified by the authorized user as being an action to cause lowering of the level of authentication.  For instance,
computing device 10, behavioral fingerprint library 170, anomalous activity library 306 alerting level of authentication module 102/102a and behavioral fingerprint library 106/106a of an action anomalous to a stored activity of anomalous activity library
306.
<br/><br/> Operation 511 can further include operation 514 alerting a predetermined set of contacts if the statistical predictability of the one or more future actions of the authorized user causes a predetermined level of authentication of the first user. For instance, computing device 10 alerting a predetermined set of contacts via social network library 302 and network interface 112 after statistical level determination module 218 determines that the statistical predictability of one or more future
actions of an authorized user causes a predetermined level of authentication of the first user 20.  The predetermined level of authentication determined for first user 20 could be a determination that first user has stolen computing device 10, that first
user 20 is on a list of users that are unauthorized, that first user 20 has entered several incorrect passwords or the like, which would cause a lowered level of authentication.
<br/><br/> Operation 511 can further include operation 515 disabling one or more devices of the authorized user if the level of authentication is lowered to a predetermined level.  For instance, computing device 10 disabling one or more devices for which
computing device 10 has control when a level of authentication determined by level of authentication module 102/102a is altered to a lower predetermined level.  The one or more devices can be configured to be automatically disabled without interference
by first user 20 or the authorized user.
<br/><br/> Operation 511 can further include operation 516 disabling a mobile device of the authorized user if the level of authentication is lowered to a predetermined level.  For instance, computing device 10 disabling a mobile device when a level of
authentication determined by level of authentication module 102/102a is altered to a lower predetermined level.  The mobile device can be configured to be automatically disabled without interference by first user 20 or the authorized user.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 5b operation 404, determining a level of authentication associated with the first user via the computing device, the level of authentication at least partially based on a behavioral fingerprint, can include operation 517
determining the level of authentication of the first user at least partially via a reconstructed key formed via gathered data from at least one social network.  For instance, computing device 10, behavioral fingerprint library 170, cryptographic library
308 receiving key data from at least one social network, such as social networks stored in social network library 302 to rebuild an asymmetric key pair, such as a public/private key pair, a Triple DES or AES type cryptographic key.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, operation 517 may further include an operation 518 for generating a security certificate associated with the authorized user based on an encryption key.  For instance, cryptographic library 308 of computing device 10
generating a security certificate associated with the authorized user based on an encryption key such as a triple DES, AES or an asymmetric key pair, such as a private/public key pair.  In doing so, the computing device 10 may store either a private or a
public portion of the public/private key pair, or a combination thereof.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments operation 518 may be followed by an operation 519 altering the encryption key to enable distribution of one or more altered forms of the encryption key to enable rebuilding of the encryption key via the gathered data from the
at least one social network.  For instance, an encryption key based on a public/private key pair could have the private key altered such that portions of the encryption key can be distributed to users/members/friends on at least one social network such
as social networks stored via social network library 302 and the portions can later be gathered from the users/members/friends of the social network.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, operation 517 for determining the level of authentication of the first user at least partially via a reconstructed key formed via gathered data from at least one social network includes operation 525 determining a
private/public key pair including a private key and a public key.  For instance, cryptographic library 308 determining a private/public key pair with a private key and a public key.
<br/><br/> Operation 525 can be followed by operation 526 altering the private key to enable distribution of one or more components of the private key, each of the one or more components of the private key required for the regenerated key.  For instance,
an encryption key based on a public/private key pair could have the private key separated into components of the encryption key for distribution of the one or more components so that the one or more components, or a combination thereof are required for
the regenerated key.
<br/><br/> Operation 526 can be followed by operation 527 distributing the one or more components of the private key to one or more members of a trusted group.  For instance, cryptographic library 308 distributing via network interface 112 one or more
components of the private key to one or members of a trusted group, such as members of a group on one or more social networks stored on social network library 302.
<br/><br/> In one implementation, operation 517 for determining the level of authentication of the first user at least partially via a reconstructed key formed via gathered data from at least one social network, can further include operation 528
determining the gathered data from the at least one social network via retrieving one or more components of the private key required for the regenerated key from one or more members of a trusted group via the at least one social network.  For instance,
cryptographic library 308 gathering data via network interface 112 one or more components of the private key from one or members of a trusted group, such as members of a group of at least one social network stored on social network library 302.
<br/><br/> In one implementation, operation 517 can further include operation 529 requesting each of the one or more members of the trusted group for the one or more components of the private key, each of the one or more members having a level of
authentication previously granted by the authorized user.  For instance, computing device 10 requesting via network interface 112 each of one or more members of a trusted group holding one or more components of the private key generated by cryptographic
library 308, and each of the one or more members stored in social network library 302, having a level of authentication previously granted by authorized user and stored in social network library 302.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, operation 517 can further include operation 530 determining one or more members of a trusted group from which to gather the gathered data, the one or more members of the trusted group belonging to the at least one social
network, each of the one or more members capable of storing a component to enable forming the reconstructed key.  For instance, computing device 10 determining one or more members of a trusted group via social network library 302, each of the one or more
members being a member of a social network, and each of the one or more members capable of storing a component of a cryptographic key created via cryptographic library 308 such that the component can be gathered as gathered data to reconstruct the
cryptographic key via cryptographic library 308.
<br/><br/> As further illustrated in FIG. 5c, in some implementations, operation 404 may further include an operation 531 for restricting access via the computing device to one or more applications in response to the determining as depicted in FIG. 5c. 
For instance, the access restriction module 104/104a of the computing device 10 restricting access via the computing device 10 to one or more items (e.g., electronic documents including electronic messages and/or productivity documents such as word
processing documents, image or audio files, applications, passwords, and so forth) in response to the determining by at least restricting access to the one or more items that were accessible by an authorized user (e.g., was visible, editable, and/or
usable by the authorized user) when the authorized user was using the computing device 10.  For instance, the application access restriction module 264 (see FIG. 2c) of the computing device 10 restricting access via the computing device 10 to one or more
applications 160 (e.g., a productivity application such as a word processing application, a communication application such as an IM application, a gaming application, and so forth) in response to the determining.  In some cases, such restrictions to one
or more applications 160 may be related to restricting use of one or more functionalities of the one or more applications 160.  In some embodiments, access can be complete, for instance, the access restricting module 104/104a including the no access
module 234 (see FIG. 2c) of the computing device 10 restricting access to the one or more items that would be accessible by the first user 20 when the first user 20 is an authorized user of computing device 10 by having the no access module 234 provide
no access (e.g., completely hiding or erasing any indications of the existence of the one or more items) to the one or more items that were accessible by an authorized user was using the computing device 10.
<br/><br/> As further illustrated in FIG. 5c, operation 531 may include one or more additional operations in various alternative implementations.  For example, in some implementations, operation 531 may include an operation 532 for restricting access via
the computing device to one or more productivity applications in response to the determining.  For instance, the access restricting module 104/104a including the document access restricting module 254 (see FIG. 2c) of the computing device 10 restricting
access to the one or more items that would be accessible by the first user 20 if first user 20 is determined to be an authorized user of the computing device 10 by having the productivity document access restricting module 255 provide restricted access
(e.g., read-only access or limited functional access if the one or more items includes one or more applications 160) to the one or more items that were accessible by an authorized user using the computing device 10.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, operation 532 may include an operation 533 for restricting access via the computing device to one or more communication applications in response to the determining.  For instance, the communication application access
restriction module 266 (see FIG. 2c) of the computing device 10 restricting access via the computing device 10 to one or more communication applications (e.g., email application, instant messaging or IM application, text messaging application, and so
forth) in response to the determining.
<br/><br/> In some cases, the access restricting operation 531 restricting access via the computing device to one or more applications in response to the determining may include an operation 534 for restricting access via the computing device to one or
more personal information manager applications in response to the determining.  For instance, the personal information manager application access restriction module 267 (see FIG. 2c) of the computing device 10 restricting access via the computing device
10 to one or more personal information manager applications (e.g., Microsoft.RTM.  Outlook.TM.) in response to the determining.
<br/><br/> As further illustrated in FIG. 5c, operation 531 may include operation 535 restricting access via the computing device to automatic tasks that are associated with a predetermined level of authentication of an authorized user in response to the
determining.  For instance, the no automatic task functionality module 235 (see FIG. 2c) of the computing device 10 preventing, via the computing device 10 and in response at least in part to the determining a level of authentication, the one or more
automatic tasks (e.g., door opening, car starting) can be prevented from being performed.
<br/><br/> A more detailed discussion related to the computer server 30 of FIGS. 1-3 will now be provided with respect to the processes and operations to be described herein.  Referring now to FIG. 6, a detailed discussion related to the computing device
10 of FIGS. 1-3 will now be provided with respect to alternative processes and operations to be described herein.  FIG. 6 illustrates an operational flow 600 representing example operations for, among other things, developing a behavioral fingerprint. 
In FIG. 6 and in the following figures that include various examples of operational flows, discussions and explanations will be provided with respect to the exemplary environment 100 described above and as illustrated in FIG. 1 and/or with respect to
other examples (e.g., as provided in FIG. 2a) and contexts.  However, it should be understood that the operational flows may be executed in a number of other environments and contexts, and/or in modified versions of FIGS. 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, and FIGS. 3a and
3b.  Also, although the various operational flows are presented in the sequence(s) illustrated, it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders other than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently.
<br/><br/> Further, in FIG. 6 and in the figures to follow thereafter, various operations may be depicted in a box-within-a-box manner.  Such depictions may indicate that an operation in an internal box may comprise an optional example embodiment of the
operational step illustrated in one or more external boxes.  However, it should be understood that internal box operations may be viewed as independent operations separate from any associated external boxes and may be performed in any sequence with
respect to all other illustrated operations, or may be performed concurrently.  Still further, these operations illustrated in FIG. 6 as well as the other operations to be described herein are performed by at least one of a machine, an article of
manufacture, or a composition of matter unless indicated otherwise.
<br/><br/> In any event, after a start operation, the operational flow 600 of FIG. 6 includes an identification operation 602 for identifying a network connection via a computer server to a computing device.  For instance, and as an illustration, the
computer server 30 connecting via network 50 to the computing device 10 of FIG. 1.  In addition to the identification operation 602, operational flow 600 may also include an operation 604 for transmitting, via the network connection, a behavioral
fingerprint associated with an authorized user of the computing device, the behavioral fingerprint providing a current status of the authorized user with respect to the computing device as further illustrated in FIG. 6.  For instance, transmitting via
network interface 112c determining a level of authentication for first user 20.  The level of authentication can be configured to restrict access to the one or more items/actions as a function of the level of authentication assigned to first user 20.  If
first user 20 is identified as an authorized user, level of authentication module 102/102a can be configured to take into account a behavioral fingerprint associated with that authorized user.  FIG. 6 further shows operation 606 for transmitting, via the
network connection, a level of authentication for network-accessible functions associated with the behavioral fingerprint to the computing device.  For instance, computer server 30 transmitting via network interface 112c a level of authentication for any
network-accessible functions shown in FIG. 2e associated with a behavioral fingerprint of computing device 20.  FIG. 6 further shows operation 608 for enabling one or more tasks to be performed automatically as a function of the level of authentication
of the authorized user.  For instance, computer server 30 enabling tasks associated with functions shown in FIG. 2e, such as communication applications 166c and productivity applications 164c to be performed automatically.
<br/><br/> As will be further described herein, the behavioral fingerprint operation 604 of FIG. 6 may be executed in a variety of different ways in various alternative implementations.  FIGS. 7a and 7b for example, illustrate at least some of the
alternative ways that operation 604 of FIG. 6 may be executed in various alternative implementations.  For example, in various implementations, operation 604 of FIG. 6 may include an operation 702 for determining the behavioral fingerprint via confirming
an internet presence of the authorized user of the computing device as depicted in FIG. 7a.  For instance, behavioral fingerprint module 106/106a/106c determining a behavioral fingerprint of first user 20 by establishing that first user 20 is an
authorized user of computing device 10, and generating a behavioral fingerprint via fingerprint build/degradation module 314 and fingerprint generation module 316, which can include statistical calculations based on prior actions to predict future
actions of an authorized user.
<br/><br/> As further illustrated in FIG. 7a, in some implementations, the behavioral fingerprint operation 702 may additionally or alternatively include an operation 703 for sensing one or more actions of the authorized user and two or more designated
internet available entities.  For instance, sensors 120 and level of authentication module 102/102a of the computing device 10 of FIG. 1 determining that first user 20 is an authorized user based, at least in part, on data provided by one or more sensors
120 and sensing activities of two or more designated internet available entities, such as via a cloud computing network, network 50, and/or device 60 shown in FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> Data from various types of sensors 120 may be used in order to determine a behavioral fingerprint to be stored on computer server 30 and computing device 10.  For example, and as further illustrated in FIG. 7a, operation 703 may be followed by
an operation 704 applying reliability criteria to the sensed one or more actions of the authorized user and the two or more designated internet available entities to generate the behavioral fingerprint of the authorized user.  For instance, the actions
of the authorized user and two or more designated internet available entities can be judged via statistical probabilities or other criteria to determine if the actions are consistent with available data and used to generate or to regenerate or amend a
behavioral fingerprint of the authorized user.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, operation 703 may include an operation 706 for storing the sensed one or more actions of the authorized user and the two or more designated internet available entities as further depicted in FIG. 7a.  For instance,
memory 114/114c, including library of behavioral fingerprints 170/170c in computing device 10/computer server 30 of FIG. 1, including storing one or more actions sensed by sensors 120 and actions over a network, such as social network interactions.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, operation 703 may include an operation 707 for detecting the one or more actions of the authorized user wherein the one or more actions of the authorized user include logging into one or more social networks as further
depicted in FIG. 7a.  For instance, memory 114c, including library of behavioral fingerprints 170c of the computer server 30 of FIG. 1 detecting one or more actions over a network, such as social network interactions.  Also, detecting one or more actions
can include an authorized user and communication application 166c running a social network application with data being stored in behavioral fingerprint library 170c.
<br/><br/> In the same or different implementations, operation 703 may include an operation 708 for mapping one or more locations of the authorized user and the two or more designated internet available entities.  For instance, the level of authentication
module 102/102a/102c of the computing device 10/computer server 30 of FIG. 1 determining that first user 20 is operating computing device 10 via a network connection and using GPS-enabled applications, such as GPS 208 shown on FIG. 2d of computing device
10 to locate the authorized user.  Additionally, any designated internet available entities can be located via social network functionalities such as a "check in" function on a smart phone application running on devices 60 or the like.
<br/><br/> In the same or alternative implementations, operation 703 may include an operation 709 for detecting contact pattern between the authorized user and the two or more designated internet available entities.  For instance, the applications 160c
applications running on a computer server/cloud computer servers 30 of FIG. 1 detecting how often an authorized user of computing device 10 contacts other internet available entities and devices 60 to determine a pattern of use associated with an
authorized user.
<br/><br/> Operations 703 may also include an operation 710 for detecting one or more contacts frequently visited by the authorized user via one or more social networks to determine a visitation pattern associated with the authorized user as depicted in
FIG. 7a.  For instance, the level of authentication module 102/102a/102c of the computing device 10 and computer server 30 of FIG. 1 detecting contacts frequently visited via Facebook.TM.  and/or Twitter.TM.  and social network library 302 by an
authorized user of device 10 to determine a pattern of visitation or frequently contacted persons associated with an authorized user.
<br/><br/> Operations 703 may also include an operation 711 for storing, via the computer sever, one or more locations visited by the authorized user, the one or more locations including one or more of physical locations and internet address-based
locations as depicted in FIG. 7a.  For instance, level of authentication module 102/102a/102c of the computing device 10 and computer server 30 of FIG. 1 via social network library 302 and GPS enabled applications 308 and the like any physical locations
and/or internet address-based locations visited by and/or associated with an authorized user.
<br/><br/> Referring to operation 704, operation 704 can include operation 712 altering the behavioral fingerprint of the authorized user as a function of the sensed one or more actions of the authorized user and the two or more designated internet
available entities.  For instance, computer server 30 and/or computing device 10 altering a level of authentication using level of authentication module 102/102a/102c as a function of the sensed one or more actions of the authorized user and the two or
more designated internet available entities.
<br/><br/> In the same or different implementations, operation 712 may include an operation 713 for generating an alert as part of the behavioral fingerprint when the sensed one or more actions of the authorized user includes a detected anomalous action as
further depicted in FIG. 7a.  For instance, alert generating module 108c interacting with the anomalous action detecting module 212 of the computing device 10 and/or computer server 30 detecting an anomalous action with respect to computing device 10 or
with respect to sensed one or more actions of an authorized user of computing device 10 during use of the computing device 10 or by using another computing device.  For example, an authorized user can borrow or use a public computer to send an alert or
create an anomalous action which indicates that any actions by the first user 20, could cause level of authentication module 102/102a to lower the level of authentication with respect to first user 20.
<br/><br/> In various implementations, the operation 713 for generating an alert may include operation 714 for transmitting the alert to the computing device.  For instance, computer server 30 sending to computing device 10 via network interface 112c an
alert to behavioral fingerprint library 170, anomalous activity library 306 alerting level of authentication module 102/102a and behavioral fingerprint library 106/106a of an action anomalous to a stored activity of anomalous activity library 306.
<br/><br/> In various implementations, the operation 713 for generating an alert may include operation 715 for transmitting the alert to one or more applications running on a cloud computing system.  For instance computer server 30 operating in a cloud
computing environment receiving the alert via network interface 112c.
<br/><br/> In various implementations, operation 715 may include operation 716 for transmitting an alert to the two or more internet available entities via the cloud computing system.  For instance, alerting a predetermined set of contacts via computer
server 30 operating in a cloud environment if the statistical predictability of the one or more future actions of the authorized user causes an alert.  For instance, computing device 10 or computer server 30 alerting a predetermined set of contacts via
social network library 302 and network interface 112/112c after statistical level determination module 218 determines that the statistical predictability of one or more future actions of an authorized user detects an anomaly.
<br/><br/> Operation 712 can further include operation 717 for notifying a predetermined set of contacts if the alert is generated by the authorized user.  For instance, computer server 30 notifying one or more devices 60 when alert is generated by an
authorized user.  The one or more devices can be configured to be automatically notified without interference by first user 20 or the authorized user.
<br/><br/> Operation 712 can further include operation 718 for disabling one or more devices of the authorized user if the behavioral fingerprint alteration indicates that the one or more devices of the authorized user have been compromised with respect to
authentication.  For instance, computing device 10 disabling a mobile device when a behavioral fingerprint determined via library of behavioral fingerprints 170 and behavioral fingerprint module 106/106a is altered to an untrustworthy level.  The devices
60 can be configured to be automatically disabled without interference by first user 20 or the authorized user.
<br/><br/> Operation 712 can further include operation 719 for disabling, via the server, a mobile device of the authorized user if the behavioral fingerprint indicates that a level of authentication for the mobile device should be lowered to a
predetermined level.  For instance, computer server 30 disabling a mobile device or any device 60 when a behavioral fingerprint determined via library of behavioral fingerprints 170c and behavioral fingerprint module 106c is altered to an untrustworthy
level.  The mobile device can be configured to be automatically disabled without interference by first user 20 or the authorized user.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 7b operation 604 transmitting, via the network connection, a behavioral fingerprint associated with an authorized user of the computing device, the behavioral fingerprint providing a current status of the authorized user
with respect to the computing device, can include operation 720 reconstructing the behavioral fingerprint of authorized user at least partially via a reconstructed key at least partially formed via data gathered from at least one social network.  For
instance, computer server 30 using behavioral fingerprint library 170c, and cryptographic library 308 receiving key data from at least one social network, such as social networks stored in social network library 302 to rebuild a public/private key pair,
a Triple DES or AES type cryptographic key.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, operation 720 may further include an operation 721 for generating a security certificate associated with the authorized user based on an encryption key.  For instance, cryptographic library 308 of computing device 10
generating a security certificate associated with the authorized user based on an encryption key such as a triple DES, AES or an asymmetrical key pair such as a private/public key pair.  In doing so, the computer server 30 may store a private portion of
the public/private key pair.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments operation 721 may be followed by an operation 722 altering the encryption key to enable distribution of one or more altered forms of the encryption key to enable rebuilding of the encryption key via the gathered data from the
at least one social network.  For instance, within computer server 30, an encryption key based on a public/private key pair could have the private key altered such that portions of the encryption key can be distributed to users/members/friends on at
least one social network such as social networks stored via social network library 302 and the portions can later be gathered from the users/members/friends of the social network.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, operation 720 includes operation 728 for determining a private/public key pair including a private key and a public key.  For instance, cryptographic library 308 determining a private/public key pair with a private key
and a public key.
<br/><br/> Operation 728 can be followed by operation 729 for altering the private key to enable distribution of one or more components of the private key, each of the one or more components of the private key required for the regenerated key.  For
instance, an encryption key based on a public/private key pair could have the private key separated into components of the encryption key for distribution of the one or more components so that the one or more components are required for the regenerated
key.
<br/><br/> Operation 729 can be followed by operation 730 distributing the one or more components of the private key to one or more members of a trusted group.  For instance, cryptographic library 308 distributing via computer server 30 network interface
112c one or more components of the private key to one or members of a trusted group, such as members of a group on one or more social networks stored on social network library 302.
<br/><br/> In one implementation, operation 720 for reconstructing the behavioral fingerprint of authorized user at least partially via a reconstructed key at least partially formed via data gathered from at least one social network, can further include
operation 731 determining the gathered data from the at least one social network via retrieving one or more components of the private key required for the regenerated key from one or more members of a trusted group via the at least one social network. 
For instance, cryptographic library 308 gathering data via network interface 112c of computer server 30 one or more components of the private key from one or members of a trusted group, such as members of a group of at least one social network stored on
social network library 302.
<br/><br/> In one implementation, operation 731 can further include operation 732 for requesting each of the one or more members of the trusted group for the one or more components of the private key, each of the one or more members previously identified
by the authorized user.  For instance, computer server 30 requesting via network interface 112c each of one or members of a trusted group holding one or more components of the private key generated by cryptographic library 308, and each of the one or
more members stored in social network library 302, having a level of authentication previously granted by authorized user and stored in social network library 302.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, operation 720 can further include operation 733 determining one or more members of a trusted group from which to gather the gathered data, the one or more members of the trusted group belonging to the at least one social
network, each of the one or more members capable of storing a component to enable forming the reconstructed key.  For instance, computer server 30 determining one or more members of a trusted group via social network library 302, each of the one or more
members being a member of a social network, and each of the one or more member members capable of storing a component of a cryptographic key created via cryptographic library 308 such that the component can be gathered as gathered data to reconstruct the
cryptographic key via cryptographic library 308.
<br/><br/> A more detailed discussion related to the computer server 30 of FIGS. 1-3 will now be provided with respect to alternate processes and operations to be described herein.  Referring now to FIG. 8, a detailed discussion related to the computing
device 10 of FIGS. 1-3 will now be provided with respect to alternative processes and operations to be described herein.  FIG. 8 illustrates an operational flow 800 representing example operations for, among other things, developing a behavioral
fingerprint.  In FIG. 8 and in the following figures that include various examples of operational flows, discussions and explanations will be provided with respect to the exemplary environment 100 described above and as illustrated in FIG. 1 and/or with
respect to other examples (e.g., as provided in FIG. 2a) and contexts.  However, it should be understood that the operational flows may be executed in a number of other environments and contexts, and/or in modified versions of FIGS. 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d,
and FIGS. 3a and 3b.  Also, although the various operational flows are presented in the sequence(s) illustrated, it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders other than those which are illustrated, or may be
performed concurrently.
<br/><br/> Further, in FIG. 8 and in the figures to follow thereafter, various operations may be depicted in a box-within-a-box manner.  Such depictions may indicate that an operation in an internal box may comprise an optional example embodiment of the
operational step illustrated in one or more external boxes.  However, it should be understood that internal box operations may be viewed as independent operations separate from any associated external boxes and may be performed in any sequence with
respect to all other illustrated operations, or may be performed concurrently.  Still further, these operations illustrated in FIG. 8 as well as the other operations to be described herein are performed by at least one of a machine, an article of
manufacture, or a composition of matter unless indicated otherwise.
<br/><br/> In any event, after a start operation, the operational flow 800 of FIG. 8 includes an association operation 802 for determining a behavioral fingerprint associated with a network accessible user, the behavioral fingerprint providing a current
status of the network-accessible user.  For instance, and as an illustration, the computer server 30 connecting via network 50 to the computing device 10 of FIG. 1 can establish and/or determine a behavioral fingerprint associated with a network
accessible user, which could be first user 20 of computing device 10 and the device or a network can provide a current status of the network-accessible user.  In addition to the association operation 802, operational flow 800 may also include a
controlling operation 804 for controlling one or more devices automatically as a function of the determined behavioral fingerprint and a direction received from the network-accessible user as further illustrated in FIG. 8.  For instance, controlling via
network interface 112c one or more devices such as computing device 10.  The behavioral fingerprint and a direction from the network-accessible user can be configured to control devices as a function of the behavioral fingerprint of a network-accessible
user.  If first user 20 is identified as the network-accessible user, level of authentication module 102/102a can be configured to take into account a behavioral fingerprint associated with that user.  FIG. 8 further shows operation 806 for transmitting,
via a network connection, a level of authentication for network-accessible functions associated with the behavioral fingerprint to the one or more devices.  For instance, computer server 30 transmitting via network interface 112c a level of
authentication for any network-accessible functions shown in FIG. 2e associated with a behavioral fingerprint of a network-accessible user.  FIG. 8 further shows operation 808 for enabling one or more tasks to be performed automatically as a function of
the level of authentication of the network-accessible user.  For instance, computer server 30 enabling tasks associated with functions shown in FIG. 2e, such as communication applications 166c and productivity applications 164c to be performed
automatically.
<br/><br/> As will be further described herein, the behavioral fingerprint operation 804 of FIG. 8 may be executed in a variety of different ways in various alternative implementations.  FIGS. 9a, 9b, 9c, for example, illustrate at least some of the
alternative ways that operation 802 or 804 of FIG. 8 may be executed in various alternative implementations.  For example, in various implementations, operation 802 of FIG. 8 may include an operation 902 for sensing one or more actions of the
network-accessible user and two or more user-designated internet available entities as depicted in FIG. 9a.  For instance, behavioral fingerprint module 106/106a/106c determining a behavioral fingerprint of a network-accessible user by establishing that
first user 20 is the network-accessible user and sensing one or more actions of the network accessible user via sensors 120 and level of authentication module 102/102a of the computing device 10 of FIG. 1.  Data provided by one or more sensors 120 and
sensing activities of two or more designated internet available entities, such as via a cloud computing network, network 50, and/or device 60 shown in FIG. 1.  In various implementations, operation 802 of FIG. 8 may also include an operation 907 for
applying reliability criteria to the sensed one or more actions of the network-accessible user and the two or more user-designated internet available entities to generate the behavioral fingerprint of the network-accessible user as depicted in FIG. 9a.
<br/><br/> Operation 902 can include operation 903 for detecting contact pattern between the network-accessible user and the two or more user-designated internet available entities.  For instance, detecting a contact between first user 20 and two or more
user-designated internet available entities, such as entities available through network 50 to internet available entities 60.
<br/><br/> Operation 902 can further include operation 904 for storing the sensed one or more actions of the network-accessible user and the two or more user-designated internet available entities in a network-accessible location.  For instance, storing
via either cloud servers 30 or computing device 10 the one or more actions of the network-accessible user and the two or more user-designated internet available entities in a network-accessible location.  For example, servers 30 and/or computing device
10 can have memory 114 and 114c capable of storing the one or more actions.
<br/><br/> Operation 902 can further include operation 905 for detecting one or more contacts frequently visited by the network-accessible user via one or more social networks to determine a visitation pattern associated with the network-accessible user. 
For instance, detecting via sensors disposed within computing device 10 and stored in memory 114 and/or 114c, and/or detecting contacts recorded via one or more social networks such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b> and Twitter or the like to establish a visitation pattern by
first user 20 as network accessible user.
<br/><br/> Operation 902 can further include operation 906 for sensing one or more locations visited by the network-accessible user, the one or more locations including one or more of physical locations or internet address-based locations.  For instance,
sensors 120 located in computing device 10 and/or software disposed in computing device 10 logging locations visited by first user 20, such as locations including physical locations and internet based locations entered on computing device 10.
<br/><br/> Operation 907 can further include operation 908 for altering the behavioral fingerprint of the network-accessible user as a function of the sensed one or more actions of the network-accessible user and the two or more designated internet
available entities.  For instance, altering via behavioral fingerprint module 106a/106c as a function of the sensed one or more actions of first user 20 and the two more designated internet available entities 60.
<br/><br/> Operation 908 can include operation 909 for generating an alert as part of the behavioral fingerprint when the sensed one or more actions of the network-accessible user includes a detected anomalous action.  For instance, promulgating a network
alert as part of the behavioral fingerprint module 106/106c functions when the sensors 120 sense one or more actions of first user 20 that include detected anomalous actions.  For example a network-accessible user posing as an authorized user of
computing device 10.
<br/><br/> Operation 909 can include operation 910 for transmitting the alert to the computing device.  For instance, in one embodiment, servers 30, and behavioral fingerprint module 160c transmitting an alert over a network to computing device 10 or to
internet available entities 60.
<br/><br/> Operation 910 can be followed by operation 911 for transmitting the alert to one or more applications running on a cloud computing system.  For instance, servers 30 as cloud servers 30, and behavioral fingerprint module 160c transmitting an
alert over a cloud network of servers 30 to computing device 10 or to internet available entities 60.
<br/><br/> Operation 911 can include operation 912 for transmitting an alert to the two or more internet available entities via the cloud computing system.  For instance, servers 30 as cloud servers 30, and behavioral fingerprint module 160c transmitting
an alert over a cloud network of servers 30 to internet available entities 60.
<br/><br/> Operation 908 can further include operation 913 for notifying a predetermined set of contacts if the alert is generated by the network-accessible user.  For instance, memory 114/114c can include a set of contacts that can be contacted if an
alert is to be promulgated over network 50 by first user 20 as a network accessible user.
<br/><br/> Operation 908 can further include operation 914 for disabling one or more devices of the network-accessible user if the behavioral fingerprint alteration indicates that the one or more devices of the network-accessible user have been compromised
with respect to authentication.  For instance, alert generating module 108/108c generating a disabling signal capable of disabling one or more devices, such as computing device 10 if an alterations via behavioral fingerprint modules 106/106c indicate
that a computing device has been compromised.  For example, an alteration that indicates that a network accessible user is performing anomalous actions such as emptying bank accounts or other actions predetermined to be anomalous or logged as being
highly unlike an expected action by a user associated with the behavioral fingerprint, a disabling signal can be generated.
<br/><br/> Operation 908 can further include operation 918 for disabling, via a server, a mobile device of the network-accessible user if the behavioral fingerprint indicates that a level of authentication for the mobile device should be lowered to a
predetermined level.  For instance, disabling signal capable of disabling one or more devices, such as computing device 10 if an alteration via behavioral fingerprint module 106/106c indicates that a computing device has been compromised.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 9b, operations continue with operation 804 which provides for controlling one or more devices automatically as a function of the determined behavioral fingerprint and a direction received from the network-accessible user. 
Disposed within operation 804 is operation 919 for determining the direction received from the network-accessible user via a network connected user interface.  For instance, determining via one of computing device 10 or server 30 a received direction
from a network accessible user, over a network connected user interface such as first user 20 or the like, via an input/output such as user interface 110 or network interface 112c on server 30 over network 50.
<br/><br/> Disposed within operation 919 is operation 920 for sensing the direction of the network-accessible user via the network connected user interface or for applying reliability criteria to the sensed direction of the network-accessible user to
generate and/or alter the behavioral fingerprint of the network-accessible user.  For instance, sensing via sensors 120, or the like, a direction from first user 20 over user interface 110.
<br/><br/> Also disposed within operation 919 is operation 921 for mapping one or more locations of the network-accessible user to confirm the behavioral fingerprint.  For instance, mapping via GPS module 280 shown in FIG. 2b a location of first user 20 or
another network accessible user to confirm a behavioral fingerprint such as a behavioral fingerprint created via module 106/106a/106c.  Also disposed within operation 919 is operation 922 for detecting the direction of the network-accessible user wherein
the direction of the network-accessible user is received via one or more social networks.
<br/><br/> Following operation 919 is operation 923 for controlling the one or more devices wherein the one or more devices include a locking device.  For instance, responsive to a direction received from a network accessible user, controlling one or more
devices having a locking device, such as locking devices 70 shown in FIG. 1.  The controlling can be via network interface 112c or one or more devices such as computing device 10.  The behavioral fingerprint and a direction from the network-accessible
user can be configured to control devices as a function of the behavioral fingerprint of a network-accessible user.  If first user 20 is identified as the network-accessible user, level of authentication module 102/102a can be configured to take into
account a behavioral fingerprint associated with that user.
<br/><br/> Following operation 923 is operation 924 for controlling the one or more devices wherein the one or more devices include a locking device, including one or more of a key fob, a door lock device, an entry gate, a safe, and a cage.  For instance,
responsive to a direction received from a network accessible user, controlling one or more devices with a locking device, such as locking devices 70 shown in FIG. 1.  including gate 71, safe 72, cage 73, key fob 74 and car 75.
<br/><br/> Following operation 924 is operation 925 for controlling the one or more devices wherein the controlling the one or more devices includes controlling access to an application running on a computing device, the direction received including an
identification of the application running on the computing device.  For instance, controlling access to computer device 10 via access restricting module 104/104a to control access to productivity applications 164 or the like.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 9C, operation 802 continues with operation 927 for reconstructing the behavioral fingerprint of network-accessible user at least partially via a reconstructed key formed via gathered data from at least one social network. 
For instance, computer server 30 using behavioral fingerprint library 170c, and cryptographic library 308 receiving key data from at least one social network, such as social networks stored in social network library 302 to rebuild a public/private key
pair, a Triple DES or AES type cryptographic key.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, operation 927 may further include an operation 928 for generating a security certificate associated with the network-accessible user based on an encryption key.  For instance, cryptographic library 308 of computing
device 10 generating a security certificate associated with the authorized user based on an encryption key such as a triple DES, AES or private/public key pair.  In doing so, the computer server 30 may store either a private or a public portion of the
public/private key pair.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments operation 928 may be followed by an operation 929 altering the encryption key to enable distribution of one or more altered forms of the encryption key to enable rebuilding of the encryption key via the gathered data from the
at least one social network.  For instance, within computer server 30, an encryption key based on a public/private key pair could have a e.g. private key altered such that portions of the encryption key can be distributed to users/members/friends on at
least one social network such as social networks stored via social network library 302 and the portions can later be gathered from the users/members/friends of the social network.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, operation 927 includes operation 930 for determining a private/public key pair including a private key and a public key.  For instance, cryptographic library 308 determining a private/public key pair with a private key
and a public key.
<br/><br/> In one implementation, operation 927 can include operation 931 for altering the private key to enable distribution of one or more components of the private key, each of the one or more components of the private key required for the reconstructed
key.  For instance, an encryption key based on a public/private key pair could have the private key separated into components of the encryption key for distribution of the one or more components so that the one or more components are required for the
reconstructed key.
<br/><br/> Operation 931 can be followed by operation 932 for distributing the one or more components of the private key to one or more members of a trusted group.  For instance, cryptographic library 308 distributing via computer server 30 network
interface 112c one or more components of the private key to one or members of a trusted group, such as members of a group on one or more social networks stored on social network library 302.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, operation 932 can be followed by operation 933 for determining the gathered data from the at least one social network via retrieving one or more components of a private key required for the reconstructed key from one or
more members of a trusted group via the at least one social network.  For instance, cryptographic library 308 gathering data via network interface 112c of computer server 30 one or more components of the private key from one or members of a trusted
group, such as members of a group of at least one social network stored on social network library 302.
<br/><br/> In one implementation, operation 933 can further include operation 934 for requesting each of the one or more members of the trusted group for the one or more components of the private key, each of the one or more members previously identified
by the network-accessible user.  For instance, computer server 30 requesting via network interface 112c each of one or more members of a trusted group holding one or more components of the private key generated by cryptographic library 308, and each of
the one or more members stored in social network library 302, having a level of authentication previously granted by authorized user and stored in social network library 302.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, operation 927 can further include operation 935 for determining one or more members of a trusted group from which to gather the gathered data, the one or more members of the trusted group belonging to the at least one social
network, each of the one or more members capable of storing a component to enable forming the reconstructed key.  For instance, computer server 30 determining one or more members of a trusted group via social network library 302, each of the one or more
members being a member of a social network, and each of the one or more members capable of storing a component of a cryptographic key created via cryptographic library 308 such that the component can be gathered as gathered data to reconstruct the
cryptographic key via cryptographic library 308.
<br/><br/> Those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between hardware and software implementations of aspects of systems; the use of hardware or software is
generally (but not always, in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant) a design choice representing cost vs.  efficiency tradeoffs.  Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there are various
vehicles by which processes and/or systems and/or other technologies described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and/or firmware in one or more machines or articles of manufacture), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the
context in which the processes and/or systems and/or other technologies are deployed.  For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and/or firmware vehicle; alternatively,
if flexibility is paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation that is implemented in one or more machines or articles of manufacture; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware,
software, and/or firmware in one or more machines or articles of manufacture.  Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes and/or devices and/or other technologies described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently
superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary. 
Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will typically employ optically-oriented hardware, software, and or firmware in one or more machines or articles of manufacture.
<br/><br/> The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and/or processes via the use of block diagrams, flowcharts, and/or examples.  Insofar as such block diagrams, flowcharts, and/or examples contain one or more
functions and/or operations, it will be understood by those within the art that each function and/or operation within such block diagrams, flowcharts, or examples can be implemented, individually and/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware,
software, firmware, or virtually any combination thereof.  In one embodiment, several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuitry (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs),
digital signal processors (DSPs), or other integrated formats.  However, those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein, in whole or in part, can be equivalently implemented in integrated circuitry, as one
or more computer programs running on one or more computers (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems), as one or more programs running on one or more processors (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more
microprocessors), as firmware, or as virtually any combination thereof, and that designing the circuitry and/or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure.  In
addition, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described
herein applies regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution.  Examples of a signal bearing medium include, but are not limited to, the following: a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk, a
hard disk drive, a Compact Disc (CD), a Digital Video Disk (DVD), a digital tape, a computer memory, etc.; and a transmission type medium such as a digital and/or an analog communication medium (e.g., a fiber optic cable, a waveguide, a wired
communications link, a wireless communication link, etc.).
<br/><br/> In a general sense, those skilled in the art will recognize that the various aspects described herein which can be implemented, individually and/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof can be
viewed as being composed of various types of "electrical circuitry." Consequently, as used herein "electrical circuitry" includes, but is not limited to, electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having at
least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific integrated circuit, one or more instructions forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer
configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices described herein), one or
more instructions forming a memory device (e.g., forms of random access memory), and/or one or more instructions forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, or optical-electrical equipment).  Those having skill in the art will
recognize that the subject matter described herein may be implemented in an analog or digital fashion or some combination thereof.
<br/><br/> Those having skill in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to describe devices and/or processes in the fashion set forth herein, and thereafter use engineering practices to integrate such described devices and/or processes
into data processing systems.  That is, at least a portion of the devices and/or processes described herein can be integrated into a data processing system via a reasonable amount of experimentation.  Those having skill in the art will recognize that a
typical data processing system generally includes one or more of a system unit housing, a video display device, a memory such as volatile and non-volatile memory, processors such as microprocessors and digital signal processors, computational entities
such as operating systems, drivers, graphical user interfaces, and applications programs, one or more interaction devices, such as a touch pad or screen, and/or control systems including feedback loops and control motors (e.g., feedback for sensing
position and/or velocity; control motors for moving and/or adjusting components and/or quantities).  A typical data processing system may be implemented utilizing any suitable commercially available components, such as those typically found in data
computing/communication and/or network computing/communication systems.
<br/><br/> The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components.  It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many
other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality.  In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively "associated" such that the desired functionality is achieved.  Hence, any
two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as "associated with" each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components.  Likewise, any two components so
associated can also be viewed as being "operably connected", or "operably coupled", to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being "operably couplable", to each other
to achieve the desired functionality.  Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and/or physically interacting components and/or wirelessly interactable and/or wirelessly interacting components and/or
logically interacting and/or logically interactable components.
<br/><br/> While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing
from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. 
Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is defined by the appended claims.
<br/><br/> It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as "open" terms (e.g., the term "including" should be
interpreted as "including but not limited to," the term "having" should be interpreted as "having at least," the term "includes" should be interpreted as "includes but is not limited to," etc.).  It will be further understood by those within the art that
if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present.  For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended
claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases at least one and one or more to introduce claim recitations.  However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles
"a" or an limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such
as "a" or "an" (e.g., "a" and/or "an" should typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.
<br/><br/> In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare
recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations).  Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, and C, etc." is used, in general such
a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, and C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A
and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.).
<br/><br/> In those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, or C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least
one of A, B, or C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.).  It will be further understood by those within the art that
virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both
terms.  For example, the phrase "A or B" will be understood to include the possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B."
