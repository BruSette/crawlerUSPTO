       <p> Methods and apparatuses for filtering electronic communications in a
     communication system. The method includes receiving a message report from
     a user in response to an electronic message received by the user, and
     identifying a confidence value associated with the user from whom the
     message report is received. The method also includes adding, if the
     confidence value exceeds a predetermined confidence value threshold, the
     confidence value to a signature value associated with the electronic
     message, and determining if the signature value exceeds a signature value
     threshold. The method further includes filtering the electronic message
     if the signature value exceeds the signature value threshold.

<br/><br/> This application, is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No.
     12/458,076, filed on Jun. 30, 2009 (now allowed), which claims the
     benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/129,494, filed
     Jun. 30, 2008. The disclosures of the above-referenced applications are
     expressly incorporated herein by reference to their entireties.
         <hr/>
<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method for determining a level of confidence to associate with a user report, the method comprising the following operations performed by one or more processors:
receiving a message report in response to an electronic message received by a user, the electronic message having an electronic signature;  identifying a pre-existing confidence value associated with the user;  associating the pre-existing confidence
value with the received message report;  calculating a response delay time corresponding to a first message report associated with the electronic signature;  calculating a new confidence value using the calculated response delay time, the pre-existing
confidence value, and a predetermined moderating value;  associating the new confidence value with the user;  and storing, in memory, the new confidence value.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining if the confidence value exceeds a predetermined confidence value threshold.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 2, further comprising: adding, if the confidence value exceeds a predetermined confidence value threshold, the confidence value to a signature value associated with the electronic message.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 3, further comprising: determining if the signature value exceeds a signature value threshold;  and filtering the electronic message if the signature value exceeds the signature value threshold.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 4, wherein the signature value threshold includes a plurality of signature value thresholds, and determining if the signature value exceeds the signature value threshold further comprises: determining if the signature
value exceeds at least one of the plurality of signature value thresholds;  determining the at least one of the plurality of signature value thresholds exceeded by the signature value;  determining a category of message type to associate with the
electronic message based on the at least one of the plurality of signature value thresholds exceeded by the signature value;  and filtering the electronic message based on the category of message type.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 5, wherein the category of message type is at least one of spam to be deleted, spam not to be deleted, and not spam.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 1, wherein the electronic message is at least one of an electronic mail (email) message, a Short Message Service (SMS) message, a Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) message, and an Instant Message (IM).
<br/><br/> 8.  A system for determining a level of confidence to associate with a user report, the system comprising: at least one memory to store data and instructions;  and at least one processor configured to access the at least one memory and, when
executing the instructions, to: receive, by the at least one processor, a message report in response to an electronic message received by a user, the electronic message having an electronic signature;  identify, by the at least one processor, a
pre-existing confidence value associated with the user;  associate, by the at least one processor, the pre-existing confidence value with the received message report;  calculate, by the at least one processor, a response delay time corresponding to a
first message report associated with the electronic signature;  calculate, by the at least one processor, a new confidence value using the calculated response delay time, the pre-existing confidence value, and a predetermined moderating value;  associate
the new confidence value with the user;  and store, in the at least one memory, the new confidence value.
<br/><br/> 9.  The system of claim 8, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to: determine if the confidence value exceeds a predetermined confidence value threshold.
<br/><br/> 10.  The system of claim 9, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to: add, if the confidence value exceeds a predetermined confidence value threshold, the confidence value to a signature value associated with the electronic
message.
<br/><br/> 11.  The system of claim 10, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to: determine if the signature value exceeds a signature value threshold;  and filter the electronic message if the signature value exceeds the signature value
threshold.
<br/><br/> 12.  The system of claim 11, wherein the signature value threshold includes a plurality of signature value thresholds, and when the at least one processor is configured to determine if the signature value exceeds the signature value threshold,
and wherein the at least one processor is further configured to: determine if the signature value exceeds at least one of the plurality of signature value thresholds;  determine the at least one of the plurality of signature value thresholds exceeded by
the signature value;  determine a category of message type to associate with the electronic message based on the at least one of the plurality of signature value thresholds exceeded by the signature value;  and filter the electronic message based on the

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> The present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for filtering of electronic communications and messages and, more particularly, to systems and methods for reporter-based filtering of electronic messages.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Email spam is a growing problem for the internet community.  Spam interferes with valid email, and it burdens both email users and email service providers (ESPs).  Not only is it a source of annoyance, it also adversely affects productivity and
translates to significant monetary costs for the email industry (e.g., reduced bandwidth, increased storage requirements, and the cost of supporting filtering infrastructures).  Also, for some categories of spam, such as phish scams, the financial costs
for users may be even greater due to fraud and theft.
<br/><br/> Generally, spam-filtering techniques can be divided into three broad categories: spam-filtering based, on sender-based, reputation, spam-filtering based on email-header analysis, and spam-filtering based on an analysis of message content.  In
the first category, a sender-based reputation framework, senders are classified as either "spammers" or "good senders," based on criteria such as the sender's identity, the sender's domain, or the sender's IP address.  The second category, email-header
spam filtering, is based on detecting forgery in the email header and distinguishing the forgery from malformatting and other legitimate explanations, such as those resulting from forwarding activity.
<br/><br/> The third category, analysis of message content, has been of particular interest to the machine learning community.  Machine learning environments using a classifier, and which apply spam detection, use both batch-mode and online update models. 
Training a classifier in batch mode allows the use of a wide range of algorithms and optimization of performance over a large quantity of training data.  Conversely, unless the classifier is frequently retrained, the system may quickly fall prey to
adversarial attacks.  Online learning approaches, on the other hand, allow for immediate incorporation of user feedback into the filtering function, but tend to be more difficult to tune, and the number of efficient algorithms is limited.  In either
approach, changes to the classification function may require a significant number of new examples, especially if the amount of data used to derive the current models was already very large.  The diversity of messages within a spam campaign may be too low
to effectively adjust the filtering function quickly enough.  It is therefore convenient to consider augmenting the operation of a conventional spam filter with one that tracks high-volume spam campaigns and attempts to eliminate those mailings only.
<br/><br/> Another problem in automating spam classification is the lack of a consensus definition for spam.  What some people consider spam may be considered solicited mail by others.  Some email-service providers allow users to mark emails they consider
spam and report them to their ESP. In some cases, users can also report opposite errors, i.e., when legitimate email is mistakenly classified as spam.  However, because user reports rely upon personalized definitions of spam, the cost of a large ESP to
incorporate each individual's judgments into the filtering system may outweigh the benefits.  Nevertheless, spam reports provided by users, as well as other forms of data acquisition have been used to build and validate spam detection systems.
<br/><br/> Of particular interest is the use of such data, to track spam campaigns sent in volume over defined periods of time, with a spam campaign assumed to consist of highly similar and often near-duplicate messages.  In that context, when, many users
report nearly identical emails as spam, one can reasonably label a campaign as spam based on the volume of user reports received.  A key requirement to the success of such a scheme is the ability to identify emails belonging to the same campaign, despite
small or irrelevant differences (some tactically inserted by the spammer to complicate detection).  The problem can be otherwise described as near-duplicate message detection, which has received considerable attention in the held of information retrieval
and as near-replica (and sometimes exact-replica) message detection in the email domain.
<br/><br/> In summary, a duplicate-based spam detector decomposes cash message into one or more fingerprints or signatures, and uses them for indexing, as well as for computing message similarity.  Operationally, a few signature-based bash-table lookups
are used to determine whether highly similar messages have beers labeled spam and.  to act.  on an incoming message accordingly (i.e., signature-based deduplication).  Fingerprinting algorithms differ in the attributes they rise for signature computation
(e.g., direct message content, message blocks, and subsets of text features), and the number of signatures per message (i.e., number of different fingerprinting algorithms applied).  Using message signatures, clustering techniques can be used to verify
cluster membership.  That is, once a cluster signature becomes known (e.g., via user reports), it is easy to determine whether an arbitrary message fells into the same cluster.  Signature-based deduplication is a form of clustering in which the stream of
all incoming emails is clustered to identify high-density spikes m the content distribution, which are likely to correspond to spam campaigns.
<br/><br/> The prior art methods may not adequately reduce the response time of spam filtering systems by recognizing a spam campaign at an earlier stage, and may not adequately incorporate user feedback.  Moreover, the prior art methods may not perform
automatic maintenance of a reliable user set.  Therefore, the prior art systems may not satisfactorily reduce the costs that users and systems incur.
<br/><br/> The disclosed embodiments axe directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above.

operate user device 120, such as, for example, security applications, authentication systems, dedicated communication system, etc. The hardware and/or software may be interconnected and accessed, as required by authorized users.
<br/><br/> As discussed above in connection with FIG. 1, electronic messages may be decomposed into one or more signatures or fingerprints which may be used for identifying similar message (e.g., spam campaigns).  Communication system 100 may be configured
to process electronic messages baaed on a determination of similarity between a group of electronic messages (i.e., a signature) and a confidence value associated with a message report received from a user.
<br/><br/> The similarity between members of a group of electronic messages may be calculated using any combination of techniques and/or algorithms.  For example, the I-Match algorithm, a signature-based approach, may be used to cluster near-duplicate
electronic messages by computing a single signature that is invariant, over small changes in message content between a plurality of electronic messages.  The I-Match algorithm computes a hash representation of an.  electronic message obtained based on a
determination of an overlap between the electronic message contents and a specially constructed I-Match lexicon.  Based on the results of the overlap determination, the I-Match algorithm assigns a signature to the electronic message.  The I-Match
algorithm is discussed in "Collection Statistics for Fast Duplicate Document Detection" (A. Chowdhury, O. Frieder, D. Grossman, and M. C. McCabe, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 20(2):171-191, 2002).
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the I-Match algorithm may be enhanced by combining the results from K random perturbations of the I-Match lexicon, where K is a whole number, to increase the robustness of the signature-based approach.  In some
embodiments, further clusters of electronic messages may be generated by grouping messages that were assigned different signatures but have very similar content.  For example, electronic messages that, have a cosine similarity above some threshold may be
grouped together to identify a spam campaign Generally speaking, cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors of n dimensions obtained by finding the cosine of the angle between them.  Cosine similarity is known in the art and will,
not be discussed herein further.
<br/><br/> Using signature values, communication system 100 may be configured to perform the functions of FilterSpam( ), to perform, message processing, and UpgradeConfidence( ) and DowngradeConfidence( ), to determine a confidence value to associate with
a message report.
<br/><br/> Table 1 is pseudocode illustrating one exemplary embodiment in which communication system 100 performs the methods of the disclosed embodiments, including the methods of FilterSpam( ), UpgradeConfidence( ), and DowngradeConfidence( ), using a
signature-based Approach.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 Reporter-Based Reputation System for Spam Filtering 1: for each time period t do 2: Set of signatures S = 0 3: Set of users U = 0 4: for each incoming TIS report {m, u} do 5: FilterSpam(m, u) 6: end for 7: for each
incoming TINS report {m, u} do 8: DowngradeConfidence(t, m, u) 9: end for 10: UpgradeConfidence(t, S, U) 11: end for
<br/><br/> In Table 1, t is a predetermined time period, S is a set of signatures associated with electronic messages observed during time period t, and U is a set of users from, whom message reports are received during time period t. As used in Table 1,
electronic messages may be email messages, and the message report may be a "this is spam" (TIS) report or a "this is not spam" (TINS) report.  Thus, for example, when a user reports an email initially placed by the system in a legitimate-email folder
(e.g., inbox folder) as spam, server 110 may receive the user report as a TIS report.  Similarly, when a user reports an e-mail, the system, initially placed in the spam folder as non-spam, server 110 may receive the user report as a TINS report.  Each
message report (e.g., TIS report, TINS report, etc.) is identified by its receipt time, electronic message body/text m, and reporting user id u.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating a method 400 of filtering electronic messages, i.e., FilterSpam( ), in communication system 100, consistent with certain disclosed embodiments.  Server 110 may be configured to receive a message report sent
from a user in response to an electronic message received by the user (step 410).  The electronic message may be, for example, an electronic mail (email) message, a Short Message System (SMS) message, a Multimedia Message System (MMS) message, an Instant
Message (IM), etc. The message report may be an electronic message report initiated by a user via user device 120.  In one exemplary embodiment, the electronic message may be an email message, and the message report initiated by the user may be a "this
is spam" (TIS) report, or a "this is not spam" (TINS) report, etc.
<br/><br/> Server 110 may be configured to identify a confidence value associated with the user from whom the message report is received (step 420).  In one exemplary embodiment, confidence values may range from 0 to 1, where a higher confidence value
indicates a higher reliability that the message report will coincide with the message reports of other users having higher confidence values.  Thus, for example, a user confidence value of 0 may indicate that either the user has not been recognized as
"trustworthy" (i.e., having a high confidence value) by communication system 100 or has been recognized as "untrustworthy" (i.e., having a low confidence value) by communication system 100.  Whereas a user confidence value of 1 may indicate that the user
has been recognized as "trustworthy."
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the confidence value may be stored in storage 114 or database 115, and server 110 may be configured to access storage 114 or database 115 to retrieve the confidence value.  In other embodiments, server 110 may calculate a
confidence value for the user from which a message report is received, and store the calculated confidence value in storage 114 or database 115.  In some embodiments, the confidence value may be recalculated upon receipt of each subsequent message report
from, the user.
<br/><br/> In one exemplary embodiment, a confidence value may be calculated for only a subset of users from winch message reports are received.  In some embodiments, server 110 may be configured to pick a random subset of a group including a first set of
reporters.  In. other exemplary embodiments, a confidence value may be calculated for a subset of users who have reported, the electronic message as spam within a specified time window after its first appearance.  Calculating a confidence value may
include calculating an upgraded confidence value, i.e., UpgradeConfidence( ), or calculating a downgraded confidence value, i.e., DowngradeConfidence( ).
<br/><br/> Equation 1 is an exemplary algorithm for calculating an upgraded confidence value, UpgradeConfidence( ), where the confidence value for a user u at time t is confidence(u, t).  As shown by Equation 1, the degree to which a positive experience
increased the confidence value of a user is described as .alpha.  which is a number between 0 to 1.  The number is large when communication system 100 is configured to build confidence in its users easily, and small otherwise.  In some embodiments, a
user can be rewarded only once in a given time period.  confidence(u, t)=confidence(u, t-1).alpha.(1-confidence(u, t-1)) Equation 1
<br/><br/> Equation 2 is an exemplary algorithm for calculating a downgraded confidence value, DowngradeConfidence( ).  The confidence value downgrade function may be used, for example, to calculate a new confidence value when a user reports an email as
non-spam but the community has identified if as spam, such that confidence in the user may diminish.  A user's confidence value may be downgraded as many times as the user submits such a report to ensure that communication system 100 is able to make a
timely response to users who begin behaving suspiciously.  The degree to which a negative experience (i.e., art incorrect report) lowers the confidence value of a user is described as .beta.  and is also a number between 0 and 1.  In contrast to the
confidence value upgrade function, in the confidence value downgrade function, in certain embodiments, a user may be penalized more than once in any given time period.  The confidence value downgrade function is: confidence(u, t)=confidence(u,
t-1).about..beta.(1-confidence(u, t-1)) Equation 2
<br/><br/> As used in Equations 1 and 2, the values of a and p may he optimized fey picking a validation set of report data, and running the system with different values of .alpha.  and .beta.  to see which values may allow the reliable user set to grow to
a desired size and maintain a steady spam coverage over time.  In some embodiments, the values of .alpha.  and .beta.  may be set to the values resulting from the validation set.  In other embodiments, the values of .alpha.  and .beta.  may be changed
over time to reflect changing user-pool dynamics.
<br/><br/> In alternative embodiments, the confidence value may be calculated by giving greater weight to more recent experiences.  That is, only the most recent confidence value is taken into account, and the previous confidence values are considered only
implicitly.  Thus, in the confidence value upgrade function, there may he no reference to the results of previous steps and no indication as to whether the user has been continuously upgraded or downgraded until time t. The confidence value calculation
gives weight only to the most recent experience.
<br/><br/> Equation 3 is another exemplary algorithm for calculating an upgraded confidence value, UpgradeConfidence( ).  In Equation 3, equal weight is given to k number of most recent experiences.  The confidence value upgrade function is:
<br/><br/> .function..function..times..function..times..times.  ##EQU00001##
<br/><br/> Equation 4 is an exemplary algorithm for calculating a downgraded confidence value, DowngradeConfidence( ).  In Equation 4, equal weight is given to k number of most recent experiences.  The confidence value downgrade function is:
<br/><br/> .function..function..beta..times..function..times..times.  ##EQU00002##
<br/><br/> Depending on the desired characteristics of the change m a user's confidence value over time, alternative confidence value functions may be used, such as, for example, upgrading the confidence value and downgrading the confidence value by a
constant, or by functions that give different weights to a certain number of recent experiences, etc.
<br/><br/> Once a confidence value associated with the user is determined, server 110 may determine if the identified confidence value exceeds a predetermined confidence value threshold .theta..sub.confidence ) (step 430).  The confidence value threshold
.theta..sub.confidence may be, for example, a constant value, an algorithm.  etc. In one exemplary embodiment, users with scores above the confidence value threshold .theta..sub.confidence are considered trustworthy users.
<br/><br/> In some exemplary embodiments, the confidence value threshold .theta..sub.confidence may be derived from the values of user .alpha.  and user .beta., and a system vulnerability value X. For example, using the confidence upgrade function,
Equation 1, the confidence value calculated for a user who is upgraded every day for X days (and has not been downgraded) is shown in Equation 5:
<br/><br/> .function..times..alpha..alpha..alpha..function..times..times.  ##EQU00003##
<br/><br/> If the user is new to the system, the initial confidence value confidence(u,0) is equal to 0.  Thus, as shown in Equation 6, if the set of trustworthy users has a minimum confidence value threshold of .theta..sub.confidence, then the minimum,
number of days X needed, to join, the set of trustworthy users, and the least number of days until a user can affect the system, is: X.gtoreq.log(1-.alpha.).sup.t-.theta.confidence Equation 6
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, there may be a plurality of confidence value thresholds .theta..sub.confidence, and different actions may be taken when the user confidence value exceeds any one or more of the plurality of confidence value thresholds
.theta..sub.confidence.  For example, as a user's confidence value
<br/><br/> increases, a greater weight may be given to the user's confidence value, and this greater weight may be calculated based on a number of confidence value thresholds .theta..sub.confidence exceeded, or a relative value, of confidence value
thresholds .theta..sub.confidence exceeded.  Thus, the higher the confidence value threshold .theta..sub.confidence, the greater the weight given to the user's confidence value,
<br/><br/> If it is determined that the confidence value exceeds the predetermined confidence value threshold, i.e., the message report was received from a trustworthy user, the confidence value is added to a signature value associated with the electronic
message (step 440).  The signature value may be a value that is maintained for electronic messages having a same signature to track and identify spam campaigns.  That is, for electronic message having a same or highly similar signature, a signature value
may be maintained and used to signal that electronic messages with that signature are either spam or not spam.  Thus, an incoming electronic message m may be labeled as "spam" or "non-spam", based on the reports of trustworthy users.
<br/><br/> Equation 7 is an exemplary equation for calculating a signature value.  As shown in Equation 7, assuming a fixed time window t for an electronic message m, sig(m) may be used to denote the signature of the electronic message, where
confidence(u.sub.t) is the current confidence value associated with trusted user u.sub.t, i.e., a user with a confidence value higher than an established threshold.  For any set M of messages with the same signature, i.e., .alpha.m.sub.i, m.sub.t
.epsilon.M ,sig(m.sub.i)=sig(m.sub.j), reporters(sig(m) may be used to denote the set of users who have reported any message m .epsilon.  M as spam.  Thus, the signature value, score(sig(m))s for an electronic message m .epsilon.  M may be computed as
shown in Equation 7.
<br/><br/> .function..function..di-elect cons..function..function..times..function..times..times.  ##EQU00004##
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, messages m may be labeled as "spam" if score(sig(m)) is above a signature value threshold .theta..sub.spam.  The signature value threshold may be selected in different ways.  For example, the signature value threshold may be
a fixed number, based on a minimum number of reporters, i.e., users sending message reports, having a minimum confidence value.  Alternatively, the signature value threshold may vary as a percentage of the number of trustworthy users N, where trustworthy
means a user with a confidence value above a. designated confidence value threshold .theta..sub.confidence.
<br/><br/> In one exemplary embodiment, the signature value threshold .theta..sub.spam may be calculated based on the confidence value threshold .theta..sub.confidence and a value corresponding to the least number of user accounts Y a malicious user needs
to affect the decision of communication system 100 regarding a particular message signature.  As shown in Equation 8, if a malicious user wants to affect communication system 100 after the malicious user joins the trustworthy user set, then the user
needs to report a message from Y accounts such that the spam score of the message rises above the spam threshold .theta..sub.spam: .SIGMA..sub.i-1.sup.m confidence(i,t).gtoreq.Y*.theta..sub.confidence.gtoreq..theta..sub.spam.  Equation 8 Therefore, as
shown in Equation 9, the signature value threshold .theta..sub.spam can be derived based on the confidence value threshold .theta..sub.confidence and a determination of the least number of accounts Y:
<br/><br/> .gtoreq..theta..theta..times..times.  ##EQU00005##
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, there may be a plurality of signature value thresholds .theta..sub.spam, and different actions may be taken when the signature value exceeds any one or more of the plurality of signature value thresholds .theta..sub.spam. 
For example, as a signature value increases, a greater weight may be given to the signature value, and this greater weight may be calculated based on a number of signature value thresholds .theta..sub.spam exceeded, or a relative value of signature value
thresholds .theta..sub.spam exceeded, Thus, the higher the signature value threshold .theta..sub.spam, the greater the weight given to the signature value.  In another embodiment, electronic messages may be categorized into different categories of
message types based on a number of signature value thresholds .theta..sub.spam exceeded, or a relative value of signature value thresholds .theta..sub.spam exceeded.  For example, when a first signature value threshold .theta..sub.spam is exceeded,
server 110 may categorize an.  electronic message as "spam.about.not to be deleted;" but when a second signature value threshold .theta..sub.spam is exceeded, server 110 may categorize The electronic message as "spam.about.to be deleted." Similarly, when
the signature value remains below the signature value threshold .theta..sub.spam, server 110 may categorize an electronic message as "not spam."
<br/><br/> If the signature value exceeds the signature value threshold, server 110 may filter the electronic message (step 460).  Table 2 is pseudocode illustrating one exemplary embodiment of spam filtering.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 Reporter-based Reputation System Spam-Filtering Algorithm FilterSpam(m, u) 1: if (u U ) then 2: U = U .orgate.  u 3: end if 4: s = sig(m) 5: if (confidence(u) &gt; .theta..sub.confidence ) then 6: if (s S) then 7: S = S
.orgate.  s 8: spam(s) = false 9: score(s) = 0 10: reporters(s) = N 11: end if 12: if (spam(s) == false) then 13: reporters(s) = reporters(s) X u 14: score(s)+ = confidence(u) 15: if (score(s) &gt; .theta..sub.spam ) then 16: spam(s) = true 17: end if
18: end if 19: end if
<br/><br/> As shown in Table 2, each message report is identified by its receipt time t, electronic message body/text m, and reporting user id u. U is a set of users reporting during a specified time period, and S is a set of signatures observed during
that time period.  The time window t in the confidence-maintenance algorithm is to ensure that a user is not rewarded more than once in the given time window, so that a high confidence value is not assigned in a too-short period of time.  The time window
does not need to correspond to the time window in the spam, filtering algorithm.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating the method 500 of filtering electronic messages in communication system 100, consistent with certain disclosed embodiments.  Similarly to step 410 of FIG. 4, server 110 may be configured to receive a message
report from a user in response to an electronic message received by the user (step 510).  The message report may be an electronic message report initiated by a user via user device 120.
<br/><br/> After receiving the message report, server 110 may identify a pre-existing confidence value associated with the user from whom the message report is received (step 520).  In some embodiments, the pre-existing confidence value maybe a confidence
value which was previously calculated for the user, and stored in storage 114 or database 115.  As discussed above in step 420, in one exemplary embodiment, confidence values may range from 0 to 1, where a higher confidence value indicates a higher
reliability that the message report will coincide with the message reports of the users having highest confidence values.  Thus, for example, a user confidence value of 0 may indicate that either the user has not been recognized as "trustworthy," i.e.,
having a high confidence value, by system 100 or has been recognized as "untrustworthy," i.e., having a low confidence value, by system 100.
<br/><br/> Server 110 may be configured to associate the pre-existing confidence value with the received message report (step 530).  In some embodiments, server 110 may access storage 114 or database 115 to retrieve a previously stored confidence value,
and may associate the stored confidence value with the received message report.  In some exemplary embodiments, the pre-existing confidence value may have been calculated according to any of the method or equations disclosed in connection with FIG. 4,
including Equations 1-7.
<br/><br/> Server 110 may be configured to calculate a response delay time corresponding to a first message report associated, with the electronic signature (step 540).  As discussed above, an electronic message signature may be a numerical representation
of an electronic message, where a large number of electronic messages having the same or highly similar message signatures may be considered to be a spam campaign.  Communication system 100 may provide an indication of the tune when a first message
report associated with an electronic message signature is received by server 110.  The first message report time may be, for example, the time when a first user indicates that an electronic message having a particular electronic signature may be spam, or
the time server 110 receives the message report indicating that an electronic message having a particular electronic signature may be spam, etc. The first message report time may be a time set by communication system 100, server 110, or user device 120. 
In one exemplary embodiment, the first message report time is the time at which server 110 receives the message report indicating that an electronic message having a particular electronic signature is spam, and the response delay time is the difference
between the first message report, time and the time at which server 110 receives the message report from the user, as discussed above in connection with, step 510.
<br/><br/> Once a response delay time has been calculated, server 110 may calculate a new confidence value using the calculated response delay time, the pre-existing confidence value, and a predetermined moderating value (step 550).  Similarly to step 420
of FIG. 4, calculating a confidence value may include calculating an upgraded confidence value, UpgradeConfidence( ), or calculating a downgraded confidence value, DowngradeConfidence( ).  In some embodiments, the new confidence value may be calculated
according to any of the methods or equations disclosed above in connection with FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> Server 110 may associate the new confidence value with the user (step 500), and server 110 may store the new confidence value in storage 114 or database 115 (step 570).  In some embodiments, an index or the like may be used to associate the new
confidence value with the user.  The new confidence value may be used by communication system 100 to perform the method disclosed in FIG. 4 or FIG. 5.
<br/><br/> In this manner, the apparatuses and methods disclosed may be configured to perform filtering of electronic messages to reduce spam and/or spam campaigns.  In addition, the apparatuses and methods disclosed herein may be configured to determine a
level of confidence to associate with a user report to improve the reliability of a spam filtering system, which, in turn, improves performance and reduces costs.
<br/><br/> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications-and variations can be made in the system and method tor reception in communication networks.  It is intended that the standard and examples be considered as exemplary
only, with a true scope of the disclosed embodiments being indicated by the following claims and their equivalents.
