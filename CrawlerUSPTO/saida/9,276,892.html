<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> FIG. 1A is a block diagram of online social media including linked and unlinked messaging, online forums, and blogs content listening, analytics and engagement (SLAE) architecture 10 comprising an application user system 60, a SLAE system 50,
and online social dialogue or linked and unlinked messaging, online forums, and blogs content provider or enabler (SMP) or database systems 40A, 40B according to various embodiments.  An application user system 60 may communicate with the SLAE system 50
via a network 16 where the network may be a local wired or wireless network or a network of networks such as the Internet.  The SLAE system 50 may communicate with a SMP system 40A, 40B via a network 16 or directly.  In an embodiment a SMP system 40A,
40B may be part of the SLAE system 50, such a micro-site campaign as discussed with reference to FIG. 35.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment a SMP system 40A, 40B may be any system that includes information or content for one or more social media providers including linked and unlinked messaging, online forums, and blogs content provider such as Facebook.RTM.,
Twitter.RTM., Google+.RTM., where the blog information may be provided by RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds.  In an embodiment linked messages may also include E-mail messages where an application user may employ the SLAE system
locally to analyze their E-mail activity.  In another embodiment an E-mail enabler such as Google.RTM., Yahoo.RTM., Hotmail.RTM., and others may provide select E-mail communications for analysis by the SLAE system 50.  In an embodiment a SMP may provide
data source adapter modules (70 in FIG. 4) to enable a SLAE 50 to retrieve/capture communications, messages, threads, and participant information including geographical and demographical participant information.  The SMP systems 40A, 40B may provide the
data on an anonymous basis, assign avatars for participant, or provide the participant SM avatar along with noted information.  A SLAE 50 system may mask the actual SM avatar to protect SM participant's privacy.
<br/><br/> A SLAE system 50 may continuously scrape SMP systems 40A, 40B to locate SM including linked and unlinked messaging, online forums, and blogs content that meet one or more criteria or factors as delineated by an application user system 60 or
formulated by the SLAE system 50 as shown in FIG. 6.  A SLAE 50 may store located or scraped SM data from SMP systems 40A, 40B to provide past demographical, biographical, and geographical information for the selected or formulated criteria and SM
participants and to aid in the analysis of SM data and related participants.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment a SLAE 50 may use an application programming interface (API) or adapter (70) to request data from or communicate data with a SMP system 40A, 40B.  A SMP system 40A, 40B may employ a search protocol based on a SLAE 50 request and
provide SM data in a predetermined format or an un-determined format.  A SMP system 40A, 40B may also provide a raw data stream to the SLAE system 50 that the SLAE system 50 may parse based on various application user's criteria and SLAE system 50
formulated criteria.  A SLAE 50 may employ semantic language and heuristics searches and natural language processing to develop queries for the SMP systems 40A, 40B and to analyze data provided by SMP systems 40A, 40B as described below with reference to
FIG. 6.  An application user via a system 60 may provide one or more terms where a SLAE 50 may to expand the user supplied criteria.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment the SLAE system 50 may include a web-server 54 where the web-server 54 may be configured to communicate messages, graphical user interfaces, and other content with a user system 60.  The web-server 54 may also be configured to
communicate messages and content with a SMP system 40A, 40B.  In an embodiment, a user system 60 may host a web browser application 42 such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Netscape, Chrome, Firefox, or Opera 34 that may be configured to communicate
messages and content with the SLAE system 50.  In an embodiment a SMP system 40A, 40B and application user system 60 may be any computer device capable of hosting an interface that can communicate with the SLAE system 50 including a web browser
application 42 including a personal computer, personal data assistant, or web enabled cellular phone or web enabled tablet computer.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment the SLAE system may employ a Ruby on Rails architecture to provide web pages or wire frames to an application user system 60.  The SLAE system may also employ Software as a Service (SaaS) to provide data and executable
instructions to application user system 60 and the SLAE system 50 webpages may be built using on a Rudy on Rails framework or other web frameworks.  In an embodiment an application user system 60 may host an application operating natively where the
application communicates data with the SLAE system 50 (such as application downloaded from an application provider or provided by the SLAE system 50).  An application user system 60 may use various operating systems including Microsoft operating systems
(Windows), Linux, Mac OS X, Android, WEB OS, and others to run a SLAE interface program or web browser.  In an embodiment a SLAE system 50 or a SMP system 40A, 40B may provide an interface application to run natively on an application user system 60.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1B is a block diagram of a social media including linked and unlinked messaging, online forums, and blogs content communication dynamics 140 according to various embodiments.  In FIG. 1B communication dynamics between various SM
participants is presented graphically with nodes 142A-E. A participant A1 at a time and date T1 may generate social media content via a SMP including posting picture, video, text, via a SMP.  One or more SMP participants that may or may not be using the
same SMP that A1 employed to post may receive a notification or observe the post (participants A11 to A1X where the nomenclature A11 to A1X is a SMP participant that has seen the A1 participant post).
<br/><br/> It is noted that X could be thousands as a function of A1 participant and the SMP, e.g., a political leader posting their intention to switch political parties.  The participants A11 to A1X may note the A1 post at various times/dates T2-T6. 
Some participants A11, A13, A1X may comment, forward, or otherwise propagate the initial A1 post, denoted as read/post at time Tx (RP:Tx), other participants may not propagate or respond in any manner to the A1 post (at least not electronically), denoted
as R:Tx (A12, A14 in FIG. 1B).  As shown in FIG. 1B the effect of the initial post by participant A1 may reach a massive group of SMP participants (become viral) and in some cases fail to propagate after a certain time and date P:T31.  The SLAE system 50
may analyze the growth of dialogue between SMP participants related to certain SM sets and subsets.  The SLAE system 50 may attempt to predict when a peek response may occur (such as 146 in FIG. 1B) and note that some participants are more active or
influential (A1 142A, A11 142B, A11X 142C) while other SMP participants follow (A14 142E, A11X2 142D).
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a diagram of communications 300 between a SLAE system 50 and an application user system 60 according to various embodiments.  In an embodiment the SLAE system 50 may provide information about social media (SM) content or linked message
located, communicated, or scraped from SMP systems 40A, 40B or an internal SLAE database 74 (such as from a SLAE system 50 hosted micro-site (FIG. 35)).  The SLAE system 50 may also provide geographical and biographical information about SM content
generators, authors, or participants that are linked to SM content identified by the SLAE system 50.  A user via an application user system 60 may provide content timing requirements or windows including times, dates, biographical, demographical, and
geographical criteria or requirements.  An application user via an application user system 60 may provide user specific parameters as queried by the SLAE system 50 to limit SM content presentations.  Based on the user specific requirements and expansion
of same by the SLAE 50 (FIG. 6), a SLAE 50 may search or scrape data in or request data from a SMP system 40A, 40B to SM content meeting the application user's times, dates, biographical, and geographical criteria or requirements.
<br/><br/> The SLAE system 50 may enable an application user to view the retrieved content using graphical and chart based formats along with statistical information related to the content and the effective content providers (SM authors or participants). 
The SLAE system 50 may enable an application user via a system 60 to engage one or participants of a SMP via one or more media or communications inserted in the respective SMP including across multiple SMP platforms (one to many--one application user to
many SMP participants across many SMP platforms).  A SLAE system 50 may also engage one or participants of a SMP by becoming an effective SMP.  In an embodiment a SLAE system 50 may host a micro-site and invite participants located via SMP content
searches meeting various user criteria.  An application user may moderate and accelerate participant activity via one or more reward programs including coupons or rewards for various goods and services including goods and services provided by the
application user.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment an application user via a user system 60 interface or web browser 62 may generate or populate a login request 302 that is processed by the SLAE system 50 such as invoking an application that links with the SLAE 50 and requesting
a login web page via a web browser.  A SLAE system 50 may receive a login request or application start and generate a login page 304 (FIG. 40 120AH).  An application user via an application user system 60 may complete the login page 304 (FIG. 40, Email
122AH, Password 124AH, login button 126AH) and forward a completed login request 306.  In an embodiment an application user of the SLAE system 50 may be required to login to provide security between the application users and the SLAE system 50.  In an
embodiment an application user via an application user system 60 may be automatically login based on their system 60 and data stored in an application system 60 (application data, web browser cookies, and other stored data).
<br/><br/> In an embodiment the SLAE system 50 may provide a social media listening and analysis (SLA) sets/subsets dashboard graphical user interface (GUI) display for viewing SLA sets/subsets status and navigating to a SLA set/subsets via an application
user system 60 (120I, FIG. 14).  An application user may request to create a SLA set (group of data from a SMP based on user provided and system 50 expanded criteria) page.  In an embodiment a user via system 60 may select the navigation tab (124L in
FIG. 17), and select "create new swarm" from the navigation tab menu (124L in FIG. 18A) to generate a create SLA page or display request 312.  In an embodiment, the SLAE system 50 may automatically provide or create a new SLA set display or page (120A in
FIG. 7) when a user via an application user system 60 logs into the SLAE system 50 and the user currently has no active SLA sets.
<br/><br/> In response to the selection or request 312, a SLAE system 50 may provide an initial create new SLA set page or display (120A, FIG. 7) 314.  A user via an application user system 60 may enter SLA set creation criteria via one or more displays
(120A, 120B, 120C, 120D, 120E, 120F in FIGS. 7 to 12) 316.  The SLAE system 50 may provide a SLA set completion or results page or display 318 (120F, FIG. 13).  In an embodiment the SLAE system 50 display or page 318 (120F, FIG. 13) may enable a user via
an application user system 60 to view results by selecting "Swarm" or SLA Set dashboard (122G in FIG. 13) where a SLA Set or Swarm dashboard 120I is shown in FIG. 14.  The dashboard 120I shows one or more SLA sets or Swarms that the SLAE system 50 is
watching or "listening to" based on selected or expanded user criteria provided during a SLA set or Swarm creation (FIGS. 7 to 12).
<br/><br/> As noted a SLAE system 50 may expand a SLA set creation request to create subsets or themes.  A user via an application system 60 may request a display listing any SLA subsets created by the SLAE system 50.  In an embodiment a user may select a
SLA subset request 322 by selecting a SLAE set 138I in FIG. 14 of a Swarm Dashboard 120I in FIG. 14.  The SLAE system 50 may generate a SLA subsets or themes dashboard GUI display for viewing SLA subsets of a SLA set (SLA Subset results page 324) shown
as such in FIG. 16, 120K.  An application user may want to engage one or more participants of SLA set or SLA subset.  A user via an application user system 60 may request engagement (326) for a SLA set or SLA subset by selecting engage on various
displays of the SLAE system 50 including 120L of FIG. 17, 120O of FIG. 21, 120P of FIG. 22, 120Q of FIG. 23, 120R of FIG. 24, 120S of FIG. 25, 120T of FIG. 26, 120U of FIG. 27, 120V of FIG. 28, 120W of FIG. 29, 120X of FIG. 30, 120Y of FIG. 31, 120Z of
FIGS. 32, and 120AA of FIG. 33, in an embodiment.
<br/><br/> In response to the engage request 326, a SLAE system 50 via an application user system 60 may display an engage request parameter page 328 such as display 120Y of FIG. 31.  A user may elect various engagement campaigns in an embodiment including
a conversation campaign 122Y and a branded micro-site campaign 124Y, and elect to engage an existing campaign 126Y.  A SLAE system 50 may provide a conversation campaign display or page 120Z of FIG. 32 when a new or existing conversation campaign is
selected.  The SLAE system 50 may provide a micro-site campaign display or page 120AC of FIG. 35B when a new or existing micro-site campaign is selected.  A SLAE system 50 may also provide a status or completed engage request page 332 showing the status
of the engagement campaign.  FIG. 36 depicts an engagement campaign status page or display 120AD for a micro-site campaign for a SLA subset (Swarm theme) 122AD.  An example of SLA set campaign dashboard is shown in FIG. 37.  FIG. 37 depicts an engagement

120AD, 120AF of FIG. 35B, FIG. 35A, FIG. 36, and FIG. 38.
<br/><br/> The administration panel module 82C may generate displays for creating, maintaining, and viewing application users of the SLAE system 50 including the display 120AG of FIG. 39.  The data visualization module 82C may generate displays including
graphs and plots such as the displays 120L (FIG. 17), 120O (FIG. 21), 120P (FIG. 22), 120R (FIG. 24), 120S (FIG. 25), 120T (FIG. 26), 120V (FIG. 28), 120W (FIG. 29), 120X (FIG. 30).  In each of the modules 82B to 82D of web application module 80, data
included in the webpages generated by the modules 82B to 82D may be provided by a storage module 74 and external database 78 via the API module 82A.
<br/><br/> The external database 78 may be one or more databases that may include SMP content or data.  The external database 78 may be shared by the SLAE system 50 with other data analytic systems in an embodiment.  The external database 78 may also be
distributed over many databases including cloud storage provided by a 3.sup.rd party.  In an embodiment the external database 78 or a portion thereof may include a PostgreSQL database, which is an open-source Object-Relational database management system
(DBMS) supporting SQL constructs.
<br/><br/> The data source adapter modules 70 may couple to a SMP to request and receive SMP data including conversations, streams, or SM data.  Various social media providers or enablers (SMP) may provide specific data source adapters such as, but not
limited to, Facebook.RTM.  72C, Google+.RTM.  72A, Twitter.RTM.  72D, and LinkedIn.RTM.  72B.  A SMP via a data source adapter module 70A, 72A-D may provide conversations, streams, or SM data and geographical and demographical information for SM data
posters, authors, or participants.  The SMP provided data may be limited by one or more key-terms and other criteria (including date range, time range, authors, geographic, and demographic) where the SLAE system 50 provides these limitations to the SMP
via a data source adapter module 70A, 72A-D. In another embodiment the SLAE system 50 may provide these limitations to a SMP via another pathway including a HTTP based request.  The SMP may provide the data via HTTP.
<br/><br/> The storage module 74 may include a database 76A and a HTTP file server (HFS) 76B.  The database 76A may store accumulated, received, or scraped SMP data (including conversations, streams, or SM data and geographical and demographical
information for SM data posters, authors, or participants).  The database 76A may also store administrative information for application users of the SLAE system 50, micro-site data, SM set, and subset data, and other conversation campaign data.  The HFS
76B may store web application module data including webpage frames or displays.
<br/><br/> The background job manager module 86 is coupled to the keyword analysis module 89, the service adapter module 90, the web application module 80, and the driver manager module 88.  The background job manager 86 may receive job requests from the
web application module and direct the operation of the driver manager module 88, the keyword analysis module 89, the service adapter module 90, and the data collectors module 84 based on the received job request.  The job requests may include create a
new SM set with one or more keywords and criteria, engage a SM set or subset with campaign selection and criteria, and generate SM set or subset status and other information and statistics related to the SM set or subset.
<br/><br/> The driver manager module 88 may be coupled to the background job manager module 86 and the data analysis module 94.  The driver manager module 88 may direct the activities of the data analysis module 94 based on requests from the background job
manager module 86.  The driver manager module 88 may direct the data analysis module 94 to analyze data stored in the database 76A based on various criteria where the data may be SM content and related information (such as geographical and demographical
information).  The driver manager module 88 may direct the data analysis module 94 to operate on collected SM set or subset data when data is collected.
<br/><br/> The service adapter module 90 may be coupled to the storage module 74 and the background job manager module 86.  The service adapter module 90 may include a first and a second service adapter module 92A, 92B.  A service adapter module 90, 92A,
92B may conduct specific analysis of SM data and related content (stored in database 76A) based on background job manager module requests 86.  In an embodiment the first service adapter module 92A may be a third party module such as a Cognition.RTM. 
(www.cognition.com) module and the second service adapter module 92A may be a third party module such as a Klout.RTM.  (www.klout.com) module.  The service adapter modules 90, 92A, 92B may determine author, poster, or participant effects or influence on
a SLA set (conversations, streams, and other SM data).  A cognition adapter module 72A may employ English (or other language as function of conversation or stream) natural language processing (NLP), semantic and heuristic analysis to evaluate a SMP
conversation or stream.
<br/><br/> Based on the analysis the service adapter module 90 may generate additional search terms that are provided to the keyword analysis module 89 via the background job manager module 86.  Such additional search terms may cause the data collectors
module 84 to capture or request more SM data for analysis where the additional data may be stored in the database 76A and subsequently analyzed by the service adapter module 90.  Accordingly this feedback cycle of the service adapter module 90 providing
more search terms for additional SM data capture may continue until the service adapter module 90 does not generate any additional search terms.  This iteration or feedback process may expand the initial search terms provided by application users to
generate a SLA set and produce SLA subsets.  In an embodiment the iteration or feedback process may also generate the SLA set or subset topics as described below.
<br/><br/> The data analysis module 94 may be coupled to the storage module 74 and the driver manager module 88.  The data analysis module may analysis collected SM data and related content stored in the storage module 74 when directed to execute by the
driver manager module 88.  The data analysis module 94 may use the search terms and related criteria to analyze the collected SM data and related content for a SM set or Swarm.  The data analysis module 94 may develop SM subsets or Swarm themes based on
the expanded search terms as determined by the keyword analysis module 88 and service adapter module 90 as noted above via the feedback cycle.  The data analysis module 94 may further determine subsets or themes as part of its analysis.  In an embodiment
the data analysis module 94 may include a sub-analysis module 96.  The data analysis module 94 or the sub-analysis module 96 may employ a Hadoop MapReduce) (http://hadoop.apache.org/mapreduce) algorithm to conduct a portion of the SM data and related
content analysis.
<br/><br/> The keyword analysis module 89 may be coupled to the background job manager module 86 and the data collectors module 84.  The keyword analysis module 89 may receive one or more key search terms from the background job manager 86 and expand the
potential key search terms using dictionaries, semantic and heuristic analysis of the provided search terms.  The keyword analysis module 89 may provide the expanded search terms and search criteria to the data collectors module 84.  The keyword analysis
module 89 operation may be iterative and the search terms may evolve with each iteration of the feedback cycle as described above.
<br/><br/> The data collectors module 84 may be coupled to the keyword analysis module 89, the data source adapter modules 70 and the collectors storage adapter module 82.  The data collectors module 84 may receive one or more search terms and other search
criteria from the keyword analysis module 89.  The data collectors module 84 may direct one or more data source adapter modules 70 to provide SM data and related content meeting the search terms and other search criteria provided by the keyword analysis
module 89.  The data collectors module 84 may also receive unfiltered SM data and related data from one or more SMP via data source adapter modules 70 and filter the received SM data and related data based on the search terms and other search criteria. 
The data collectors module 84 may forward the searched or filtered SM data and related content to the collectors storage adapter module 82.
<br/><br/> The collections storage adapter module 82 may be coupled to the data collectors module 84 and the storage module 74.  The collections storage adapter module 82 may receive SM data and related content in various formats as a function of the SMP. 
The collections storage adapter module 82 may reformat to a standard format for storage in the database 76A.  The collections storage adapter module 82 may use translation tables to reformat received SM data and related content as a function of the SMP
that provided the SM data and related content.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of a create new SM set method 100 according to various embodiments.  When the SLAE system 50 receives a create new SM set (termed a Swarm or Super Swarm in an embodiment) (activity 102A), the SLAE system 50 via the web
application module 80 may invoke the background job manager 102B.  In order to complete a create new SM set (Swarm or Super Swarm), the web application module 80 may provide the displays (120A-G of FIGS. 7-13) to an application user.  The resultant
search terms and related criteria as entered by an application user via the displays (120A-G of FIGS. 7-13) and received by the web application module 80 may be forwarded to the background job manager module 86 (activity 102B).
<br/><br/> The background job manager module 86 may forward the search terms and related data to the keyword analysis module 88 to conduct keyword analysis on the provided search terms and related search criteria (activity 102C).  The keyword analysis
module 88 may expand the original search terms using selected dictionaries, semantic and heuristic analysis.  As noted the service adapter module 90 may expand the search terms by using NLP and semantic and heuristic analysis of collected data.  The data
collectors module 84 may be invoked and supplied with the expanded search terms and criteria generated by the keyword analysis module 88a and service adapter module 90 (activity 102D).  As noted the data collectors module 84 may collect SM data and
related content from one or more SMP via data source adapter modules 70.
<br/><br/> When SM data and related content is collected (via the collectors storage adapter module 82 and the storage module 74 in an embodiment) (activity 102E) or retrieved from historical collections, data analysis of the collected/retrieved SM data
and related content for the new SM set or Swarm may be started (activity 102F).  The data analysis module 94 and the service adapter module 90 may be employed to conduct data analysis on the collected SM data and related content.  The resultant SM sets
and subsets and topics (Swarms and themes) and analysis may be stored in the storage module 74 (activity 102G).  The newly formed SM sets and subsets may be presented to an application user via a display (activity 102H), such as display 102I of FIG. 14.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a flow diagram 110 for creating SM subsets or themes based on one or more keywords provided by an application user to form a SM set or Swarm, SM subset or themes, and topics according to various embodiments.  A SLAE system 50 may start
searching SM data or related content for conversations or streams based on one or more keywords (activity 112A) that may be provided by an application user 61.  A SLAE system 50 via keyword analysis module 88 (in an embodiment) may determine or expand
the initial keywords (activity 112B).  As noted the key words or terms may be expanded by referencing one or more dictionaries and employing semantic, heuristics, and other analysis tools.  When the expanded words or terms are similar (activity 112C), a
Cognition algorithm may be employed to expand the keywords or terms (activity 112D) (via a service adapter module 90 in an embodiment) and start the feedback process of activities 112D, 112G, 112F, 112E, and 112C.
<br/><br/> Based on the expanded terms additional SM data and related content may be collected and analyzed (activity 112G) (via the data analysis module 94 where the module 94 may employ a Hadoop MapReduce algorithm to analyze the SM data).  The analyzed
data may form Swarm Themes or SM subsets and topics that may be stored (activity 112H) (in the storage module 74, a Greenplum database in an embodiment).  When use learning may be employed (activity 112F), the algorithm 110 may develop learning keywords
(activity 112E) and repeat activities 112C, 112D, 112G, 112F, 112H, and 112E until use learning does not yield additional search terms or words to develop additional SM subsets or Swarm themes.  As noted the NLP and other analysis of collected SM data
may generate new search terms where the new search terms may enable the SLAE system 50 to collect additional SM data and repeat this process until no new search terms are generated from the additional SM data.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment the SLAE system 50 may provide an application user 61a plurality of graphical user interface (GUI) screens or displays including the displays shown in FIG. 7 to 13 as part of a process to create a new SLA set.  The SLAE system
50 may employ the web application module 80 and web server module 83 to generate and process SLA set creation displays where the web server module 83 may communicate the pages or displays 120A-120G (shown in FIG. 7 to 13) to the application user 61 via a
user system 60.  In an embodiment a new SLA set creation process may include enabling an application user 61 to: A. select SMP data sources (FIG. 7, display 120A); B. select dictionaries (FIG. 8, display 120B); select dictionary topics (FIG. 9, display
120C); add dictionaries to be used in a SLA set creation process (FIG. 10, display 120D), enter search terms directly or via a file upload to be used in a SLA set creation process (FIG. 11, display 120E); add one or more filters or parameters to be used
in a SLA set creation process (FIG. 12, display 120F); and select the next activity after the SLA set creation process is started (FIG. 13, display 120G).
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 illustrates a SLA set creation graphical user interface (GUI) display 120A for selecting social media sources according to various embodiments.  As shown in FIG. 7 an application user may select one or more SMP data sources 122A to be
searched or reviewed (past posts) during a SLA set creation.  It is noted that the selected SMP sources 122A may lead to posts on other SMP sources.  It is noted that the GUI display 120A also includes a user selectable navigation tab 124A.  When an
application user 61 selects the navigation tab 124A a pop out window 124L shown in FIG. 18A may be displayed over the page or display where the tab 124A is selected including display 120A.  An application user may select the next tab of display 120A to
cause the user application user system 60 to generate a response message, link, or HTML file, or other data file including the user SMP source selections 122A.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 illustrates a SLA set creation GUI display 120B for selecting dictionaries or resources for keyword expansion according to various embodiments.  A SLAE system 50 may provide the display 120B to an application user 61 via a user system 60
as part of a SLA set creation request or process.  The SLAE system 50 may generate or provide the display 120B after user 61 completion of SMP source query page or display 120A of FIG. 7.  As shown in FIG. 8 an application user 61 may provide a name 122B
for SLA set to be created or formulated.  An application user 61 may also select one or more dictionaries 124B or its related topics 126B (display 120C, FIG. 9 may be invoked when selected) where the selected dictionaries 124B and topics 126B may be
searched, incorporated, or analyzed as the part of the SLA set creation request or process.  A user 61 may also add dictionaries 128B (display 120D, FIG. 10 may be invoked when selected) to be included or considered in a SLA set creation request or
process.  In particular the dictionaries 124B and topics 126B may be employed to expand search terms (display 120E, FIG. 11) a user selects or provides as part of the set creation request or process.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 illustrates a SLA set creation GUI display 120C for selecting dictionaries or resources specific topics according to various embodiments.  As shown in FIG. 9, one or more dictionary 122C topics 124C may be selectable by an application
user 61.  The display 120C may be generated or provided by a SLAE system 50 when a user 61 selects a number of topics 126B in display 120B of FIG. 8.  The number of topics may include a hyperlink that forwards the request for topic list to the SLAE 50. 
FIG. 9 may be displayed when a user 61 selects the WebMD number of topics 126B in an embodiment.  After a user 61 selects or deselects a dictionary topic(s) the user selections may be forwarded to the SLAE 50 system via the selection of the OK button or
link on display 120C of FIG. 9.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 illustrates a SLA set creation GUI display 120D for selecting additional dictionaries or resources 124D according to various embodiments.  A SLAE system 50 may generate the display 120D when an application user 61 selects the add
dictionary link or button 128B of FIG. 8.  As shown in FIG. 10 an application user 61 may select one or more dictionaries 124D to be reviewed, evaluated, considered, or analyzed during a SLA set creation including the expansion of any search terms
provided by a user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 illustrates a SLA set creation GUI display 120E for entering or loading search terms according to various embodiments.  As shown in FIG. 11 the GUI display 120E may enable an application user 61 to enter one or more search terms 122E and
upload a file including one or more search terms 124E.  The file may have a predetermined format including a MS.RTM.  Excel.RTM.  XLS file or a text delimited file.  The SLAE 50 may employ the process 100 and 110 shown in FIGS. 5 and 6 to expand the
search terms via a feedback loop where additional SMP data is retrieved based on the additional, expanded search terms and the process is repeated until use learning (based on new SMP data) does not yield additional terms.  The SLAE system 50 may also
consider or apply one or more parameters or filters that an application user 61 may have set or specified via the GUI display 120F shown in FIG. 12 during the employment of the process(es) 100 and 110 in an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 12 the GUI display 120F may enable an application user 61 to specify or elect SMP data sources 122F, the conversation sentiment 124F, the conversation posting date range 126F, the conversation relevance to the search terms 128F,
the acceptable age range of conversation posters or authors 132F, the acceptable gender of conversation posters or authors 134F, one or more consumers brands mentioned in the captured conversation(s) 136F, and the election of one or more topics related
to the user provided search terms 138F.  In an embodiment the topics may be generated by a natural language process (NLP) analysis and categorization of the SM data that comprises the SLA set or subset.
<br/><br/> A SM conversation sentiment positive, neutral, and negative may be determined by natural language processing of captured SMP data and searching for common terms related positive, neutral, and negative sentiment or expression.  The sentiment
analysis may correlate the sentiment terms and the user provided search terms based on modifiers and word distance between the terms.  An application user 61 via display 120F may limit captured conversations to have a particular sentiment 124F based on
the sentiment determination.  The SLAE system 50 may determine a SM conversation or post's relevance based on natural language processing of the conversation or post in relation to the user provided search terms including the frequency and context of the
search terms in the conversation or posts.
<br/><br/> A user may provide a list of one or more brands 136F whose mention they may want noted or present in captured SM streams, conversations, or posts.  The brand list 136F may be populated by the SLAE 50 based on the user provided search terms.  In
addition a SLAE 50 may be customized for the application user 61 based on the desired industry or market area the application user 61 wants to engage or analyze.  The display 120F and other displays 120A-120AF may be optimized or customized for an
application user 61 interested in engaging or analyzing SM data of interest or related SM data.  The SLAE system 50 may also populate the selectable related topics 138F based on the user provided terms and the selected dictionaries and a natural language
process (NLP) analysis and categorization of the SM data that comprises the SLA set or subset.
<br/><br/> Upon entry of the filter terms of display 120F of FIG. 12 (via the next button or link in an embodiment), the SLAE 50 may employ the process 100 and 110 shown in FIGS. 5 and 6 to expand the search terms via a feedback loop where additional SMP
data is retrieved based on the additional, expanded search terms and the process is repeated until use learning (based on new SMP data) does not yield additional terms.  The SLAE system 50 may also consider or apply one or more parameters or filters that
an application user 61 may have set or specified via the GUI display 120F shown in FIG. 12 during the employment of the process(es) 100 and 110 in an embodiment to start generating SLA sets and subsets.
<br/><br/> The SLAE system 50 may generate or provide a SLA set creation GUI completion display 120G for selecting next actions to note the SLA set creation process to an application user system 60 has started in an embodiment.  As shown in FIG. 13 an
application user 61 may elect to visit a main menu or SLA set dashboard 122G (such as display 120I shown in FIG. 14), create another SLA set 124G (return to display 120A shown in FIG. 7), or perform other functions.  The SLAE system 50 may provide or
generate multiple SLA set dashboards based a user selected view type (122I, FIG. 14) including a dashboard display 120I (FIG. 14) by SLA set and a 120J by SLA subset or theme, where the themes or subsets may be generated by the SLAE system 50 during the
main SLA set creation process.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 illustrates a SLA sets dashboard GUI display 120I for viewing SLA sets status and navigating to a SLA set according to various embodiments.  As shown in FIG. 14 the SLAE system 50 may show panels 124I for one or more SLA sets created by
an application user 61.  An application user 61 may also be able review de-activated swarms by selecting the link or button 142I.  In an embodiment a user 61 may elect to deactivate a SLA set.  The SLAE system 50 may store deactivated SLA sets and
subsets and enable a user 61 to re-activate such sets or subsets.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 14 a SLA set panel 124I may include an index 126I, a sentiment direction indication or arrow 128I, a user (or poster) count by gender 132I, a conversation volume tend graph 134I, a SLA set manager listing 136I, and a go to SLA
set details button or link 138I where the SLAE system 50 may generate or provide the display 120K in FIG. 16 when selected in an embodiment.  In an embodiment the index 126I may be the sum of combination of activity indicators.  The sentiment direction
128I may indicate that bias of the captured posts that comprise the SLA set, i.e., when positive (up arrow), majority within a tolerance or percentage of captured posts or conversations are positive, negative (down arrow), majority negative with the
tolerance, and neutral (dash) where the captured posts or conversations are approximately neutral (between positive and negative in the tolerance range).
<br/><br/> A SLA set panel 124I may further include a user or poster count by gender for the captured conversations, posts, or blogs that comprise the SLA set.  The panel 124I may also include a time based graph showing the number of posts in a time window
where each bar may represent the conversation capture amount for a particular time interval, e.g., by day in an embodiment.  The panel 124I may also indicate the manager 136I of the SLA set when assigned or selected by an application user 61.
<br/><br/> FIG. 15 illustrates a SLA sets/subsets dashboard chart GUI display 120J for viewing SLA sets/subsets status and information and for navigating to a SLA set/subset according to various embodiments.  As shown in FIG. 15 the SLA set/subset display
120J may include SLA subsets in row format.  Each display 120J row may include the SLA subset or theme 144J, the SLA set 124J, an active campaign number 146J, manager name 136J, sentiment graphical indication 128J, combined index 126J, user count by
gender 132J, and SLA subset drill down or go to button or link 138J.
<br/><br/> A SLA subset name 144J may include the search terms that created the SM data capture or set.  An application user 61 may engage a group of poster, authors (or users) of captured conversations by starting an engagement campaign including a
conversation campaign and a micro-site campaign.  The field or column "number of campaigns" 146J may indicate the number of active engagement campaigns for the SLA subset 144J.  In an embodiment when an application user 61 via a user system 60 points to
a SLA subset campaign number a pop-up window 148J may be generated.  The campaign pop-up window 148J may list the active campaigns 152J, 154J and include a hyper-text link to a campaign display (such as display 120AA of FIG. 33).  The campaign pop-up
dashboard 148J may also include a graphical indication of the campaign type: a text bubble for a conversation campaign and stacked pages for a micro-site campaign in an embodiment.
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 illustrates a SLA subsets or themes dashboard GUI display 120K for viewing SLA subsets status and information, and for navigating to a SLA subset details according to various embodiments.  As shown in FIG. 16 the display 120K may include
a panel 124K for each SLA subset or theme.  Each SLA subset panel 124K may include the SLA subset name or theme 124K, combined index 126K, graphical sentiment indicator 128K, liveliness index 135K, activity index 136K, member information with gender
percentages 132K, posting activity graph by time 134K, SLA subset formation or creation date 138K, number of SMP sources that comprise the captured SM data 142K, a link to detail statistics for SLA subset 144K, and a link 146K to view a graphical chart
of the SLA subset 146K.
<br/><br/> The liveliness index 135K may reflect the captured data interaction between posters with and without sentiment considerations in an embodiment.  The activity index 136K may indicate the percentage activity of the SLA subset relative to the sum
of all related SLA subset (of the same set) in an embodiment.  The members 132K may list the number of unique posters of captured SM data and include a gender breakdown by percentage in an embodiment.  The date created 138K may indicate the date the SLA
subset was created by the SLAE system 50.
<br/><br/> FIG. 17 illustrates a SLA set/subset node based GUI display 158L for viewing SLA sets/subsets graphically according to various embodiments.  FIG. 17 includes a node-type graph 140L that depicts SLA subset information via nodes plotted by
frequency of subset mentioned (in posts or conversations) 138L (y-axis) versus number of people mentioning the subset 142L (x-axis).  The frequency of subsets mentions may indicate the number of times one or more search terms appears in SM captured data
representing a SLA subset.  The number of people mentioned SLA subset may represent may indicate the unique number of posters or authors associated with the SM captured data that includes the one or more search terms appears where the SM captured data
represents the SLA subset.  Each node 144L may represent a SLA subset.
<br/><br/> The node's radius may be reflective of the number of posts or conversations that comprise the corresponding SLA subset.  The dashed other circle 145L about each node 144L may represent the projected maximum number of posts or conversation that
comprise the corresponding SLA subset in an embodiment.  The node color (dark, medium, light or varying colors) may represent the sentiment of the conversations that comprise the corresponding SLA subset.  When an application user 61 via a user system 60
points to a node 144L a pop-up SLA subset control window 146L may appear.  The SLA subset control window 146L may list the SLA subset combined index 146L, a projected peak date 148L, and have several more information options including viewing a
amplification peak date display (120P, FIG. 22), a conversation topics display, a social media source display (120S, FIG. 25), a location display (120V, FIG. 28), and a people display (120R, FIG. 24) (in an embodiment).
<br/><br/> A SLAE system 50 may generate the pop-up window 122O show in FIG. 21 when the export button or link 134L is selected by an application user 61.  The window 1220 of FIG. 21 may enable a user to download the display 120L information in a PDF chart

<br/><br/> FIG. 20 is a block diagram of GUI displays that a SLA application user can evoke based on filter and data selections according to various embodiments.  The available GUI displays 120N may be based on a SLA set 122N, SLA subset 124N, SM data
source 126N, SM data poster or author location 128N, the SM data poster or author 132N, and SLA topics 134N where each an application user may be able to drill into further displays as shown in FIG. 20.
<br/><br/> FIG. 22 illustrates a SLA subset projected amplification peak graph GUI display 120P for viewing potential subset activity peaks and selecting dates or events based on the graph according to various embodiments.  As noted with reference to FIG.
1B, a single SM conversation or stream may expand into thousands of related down-stream conversations 142C, 142E, 142D, and reach a peak or maximum number of related conversations 146 and then dwindle to a minimum or nominal number of conversations.  It
may be desirable to predict the potential peak date of a conversation set or subset (SLA set or subset)--such as the peak shown in display 120P of FIG. 22.  It may be further desirable to predict an the up slope of the curve 122P as an entry point to
engage one or more participants of the SLA set or subset via an engagement campaign before the SLA set or SLA subset reaches a peak and starts to subside.
<br/><br/> The SLAE 50 system may monitor or analyze a SLA set or subset by time and extrapolate the time/date of the potential up-slope and potential peek.  The SLAE 50 system may use multiple SM data characteristics 126P to extrapolate the potential up
slope 122P and potential peek.  The SLAE system 50 may use historical data from other SLA data subsets and sets to determine patterns and use these patterns to map or model a similar curve for the current SM data comprising the SLA set or subset.  As
shown in FIG. 22 a SLAE system 50 may generate a pop-up panel 124P for a SLA set or subset.  The panel 124P may include a combined index, a project peak date, and several selectable links for topics/keywords, social media source, location, and people. 
An application user 61 may also select an add event button or link 128P.  In response to the selection the SLAE system 50 may generate an Add Event window 122Q shown in FIG. 23, display 120Q.

store the event time/dates and show the events as diamonds on the x-axis as shown in 120P, FIG. 22.
<br/><br/> FIG. 24 illustrates a SLA subset of people or participants graph based GUI display 120R for graphically displaying participant information for a SLA subset according to various embodiments.  The SLAE system 50 may generate display 120R of FIG.
24 when an application user 61 selects a people, participant, or user button or link such as button or link 125P of pop-up window 124P of display 120P, FIG. 22.  As shown in FIG. 24 the display 120R may provide a graphical representation of the people,
participants, or authors associated with captured data comprising the SLA subset.  As shown in FIG. 24 the display may separate the people into three categories, pollinators, connectors, and tail activity.  In an embodiment, people, participants, or
authors may be considered pollinators when they create and or transmit SM data or content of the SLA subset.  People, participants, or authors may be considered connectors when they share high volumes of SM data or content of the SLA subset and may be
considered long tail members when they share little or merely read SM data or content of a SLA subset.
<br/><br/> The SLAE system 50 may analyze the SM data comprising a SLA subset and categories the participants into the three categories.  The different participant categories may be represented in the graph of display 120R via different shading or
coloring.  As shown in FIG. 24, when an application user select an icon representing one of the three categories an information display panel 134R may provide details for the corresponding category including the number of people in the category and the
total number of participants in the SLA subset SM data, a sentiment direction indicator for the SLA subset, and links for different information view displays for the respective people category including social media source 138R, Users, Gender details,
Location, and Topics/Keywords 142R.
