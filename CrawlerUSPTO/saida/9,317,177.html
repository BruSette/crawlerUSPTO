captured photos and videos in the memory 112.  The camera application 130 may also cause the most recently captured photos and videos to be displayed and may provide options for the user to perform various actions in relation to the photos and videos. 
For example, the user may share the photos and videos via a choice of communication means.  Also, the user may select an option to view and/or edit a video or a set of photos using the viewing/editing module 133.
<br/><br/> The gallery application 131 may allow the user to organise and view photos (or other digital images) and videos stored in the memory 112.  Photos and videos may be sourced in any suitable way.  Photos and videos may be captured by the camera
105.  Alternatively, they may be received as files, for instance as an attachment or embedded within a message such as an email, an instant message, a multimedia message service (MMS) message or a message provided through a social network service
provider such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or LinkedIn.  Photos and videos may instead be hosted remotely.  For instance, photos and videos may be held within a user's gallery on a service such as Ovi, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or Flickr.
<br/><br/> A plurality of photos and/or videos may be organised into groups or sets.  For example, photos and videos may be associated with tags (`tagged`).  A tag is preferably a keyword or some other metadata associated with one or more photos or videos. A tag may include information about the geographical location or the date and time at which the photo or video was captured.  A tag may include information about the names) of person(s) in the photo or video.  Photos and videos may be tagged in any
suitable way.  Tagging may be performed by the user or by the terminal 100 or by another entity.  Alternatively or additionally, photos and/or videos may be grouped together by placing them in folders or subfolders.  The folders may be associated with
the file system used to store the photos and/or videos in the memory 112 or they may be virtual folders.  Alternatively or additionally, the terminal 100 may group together photos which have been captured by the camera 105 operating in a burst mode, e.g.
when several photos are captured in quick succession in response to a single input.
<br/><br/> The gallery application 131 may provide options for the user to select photos, videos and/or groups or sets thereof and perform various related actions.  For example, the user may share selected photos and/or video via a choice of communication
means.  Also, the user may select an option to view and/or edit a selected video or a selected set of photos using the viewing/editing module 133.
<br/><br/> The viewing/editing module 133 may provide a way for the user to view and/or edit content.  The content is preferably a video.  The content may also be a set of photos or images (referred to in the following as `images`).  The viewing/editing
module 133 preferably operates in conjunction with the camera application 130 or the gallery application 131.  The viewing/editing module 133 may also be accessible from one or more other software applications 132, such as a web browser or an email or
messaging application.  In such cases, the content to be viewed and/or edited is selected in or by the application 131, 132, 133.  The viewing/editing module 133 may also operate as a stand-alone application.  In such a case, the viewing/editing module
133 preferably provides a way for the user to select the content to be viewed and/or edited.
<br/><br/> As will be described in more detail below, the viewing/editing module 133 may be configured to divide the content into a number of parts, each of which is associated with, and represented on the display 102 by, a respective element, for example
a key frame/image 155 (see FIG. 5).  In the case of a video, the key frame 155 may include the first video frame of the associated part of the video.  In the case of a set of images, the key image 155 may include one or more of the images in the sub-set
of images.  Alternatively or additionally, the key frame/image 155 may comprise text.  The user may control the number of parts and hence the number of key frames/images 155 which are displayed by making a suitable input, such as dragging the icon 151
(see FIG. 5) across the display 102.  Various actions may then be performed.  These actions include, for example, editing the content or parts of it.  For instance, one or more of the displayed key frames/images 155 can be selected and a new video or a
new set of images produced including only the parts associated with the selected key frames/images 155.  Also, for instance, the part of the content associated with one of the displayed key frames/images 155, e.g. one or more video frames or images, can
be edited.
<br/><br/> A dividing module 134 preferably forms part of the viewing/editing module 133.  The dividing module 134 may be configured to analyse the content and to provide information about how the content is to be divided into parts and/or about the key
frames/images 155 (see FIG. 5) to be displayed.  This information may be used by the viewing/editing module 133 when displaying the key frames/images 155 and also when performing other operations.
<br/><br/> If the content is a video, then the dividing module 134 is preferably configured to divide the video into parts in such a way that the different parts correspond to different shots or scenes in the video, different periods during which
particular objects or peoples are in the shot, and so on.  In order to do so, the dividing module 134 may analyse the differences between the different frames of the video.  This analysis may be performed in any suitable way.
<br/><br/> For example, the dividing module 134 may determine one or more parameters associated with each frame and then compare these parameters for pairs of consecutive or nearby frames in order to determine a score representing the degree of difference
between each pair of frames.  If the video is encoded, for example using Moving Picture Experts Group-4 (MPEG-4) encoding, then the determination is preferably based upon one or more of the encoding parameters (rather than the decoded images).  Thus, the
determination may be performed relatively quickly.
<br/><br/> Each pair of frames may represent a potential dividing point for the video.  The importance or prominence of each potential dividing point may depend upon the associated score.  So that the video can be appropriately divided into a specified
number of parts, the pairs of frames may be ordered according to the associated scores.  Pairs of frames for which the associated scores do not reliably represent a potential dividing point, for example scores below a certain threshold value, may be
ignored.  This threshold value may be fixed or may be adapted to the video being divided.  Alternatively or additionally, there may be a maximum number of potential dividing points and hence a maximum number of parts into which the video can be divided. 
The maximum number of parts may be pre-set, for example at a number between 10 and 100 depending upon the capabilities of the terminal 100.  The number may also be changeable by the user.
<br/><br/> Information relating to the potential dividing points of the video may be stored in memory 112 or 114.  An image corresponding to the frame after the potential dividing point, e.g. the second of the pair of frames, may also be stored together
with the information.  This image may then be used as a key frame 155 (see FIG. 5).  Alternatively, the terminal 100 may generate such an image when it is needed.
<br/><br/> If the content is a set of images, then the dividing module 134 may divide the set of images in various different ways.
<br/><br/> For example, the set of images may be divided based upon the visual content of the images.  The set of images may be divided in such a way that each part or sub-set of images contains similar images, for example images having similar backgrounds
and/or foregrounds.  The dividing may be performed in any suitable way.  For example, the dividing module 134 may analyse the image data and determine one or more parameters associated with each image.  Cluster analysis may then be performed using a
suitable algorithm.  The cluster analysis may be performed in order to generate a series of `divisions`, wherein the set of images is divided into a different number of sub-sets in each division.  The first division may consist of two sub-sets, the
second division may consist of three sub-sets, and so on.
<br/><br/> Alternatively or additionally, the set of images may be divided based upon characteristics of the images other than their visual content.  For example, the set of images may be divided based upon one or more tags such as keywords, geographical
location, date, time and/or name.  Alternatively or additionally, the set of images may be divided based upon the folders into which the images have been placed.  The dividing may be performed in any suitable way.  For example, the set of images may be
ordered in dependence upon the characteristics being used to divide them.  If the characteristics comprise text, e.g. keywords, then the images may be ordered alphabetically by keyword.  If the characteristics comprise numbers or times and dates, then
they may be ordered numerically or temporally.  The ordered set of images may then be divided appropriately.  The dividing module 132 may generate a series of `divisions`, wherein the set of images is divided into a different number of sub-sets in each
division.  For example, a first division may consist of a first sub-set of images tagged with a keyword beginning with one of the letters `A` to `M` and a second sub-set of images tagged with a keyword beginning, with one of the letters `N` to `Z`.  A
second division may consist of three subsets corresponding respectively to `A to `I`, `J` to `R`, `S` to `Z`.  As another example, a first division may consist of two subsets corresponding respectively to images dated `today` and `earlier`, a second
division may consist of three subsets corresponding respectively to `today`, `this month` and `earlier`, and so on.
<br/><br/> In such cases, information relating to the divisions of the set of images may be stored in memory 112 or 114.  Images associated with each' of the sub-sets may also be stored together with the information.  These images may then be used as key
images 155 (see FIG. 5).  If the images are ordered in some way, then each key image 155 is preferably the first image in each sub-set.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the set of images may be divided based upon one characteristic and then another, e.g. based upon keyword and then time and date.
<br/><br/> If the set of images is to be divided based upon both their visual content and their time and/or date, then this may be performed in a similar manner to dividing a video, as described above.
<br/><br/> An example method of operation of the terminal 100 will now be described with reference to the flow chart of FIG. 4.  The steps of this figure may be performed by one or more of the software applications 128, 130, 131, 132 and modules 133, 134
shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.
<br/><br/> The operation of FIG. 4 will be described with some reference to FIGS. 5a to 5d, and afterwards FIGS. 5a to 5d will be described with reference to FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> At step S1, the operation starts.  As described above, this is preferably in response to the user having selected an option to edit a selected video or a selected set of images in the camera application 130, gallery application 131 or other
application(s) 132.  In the following, the selected content will be referred to as `the content`.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the terminal 100 may provide the user with an option to select a part of the content to be viewed and/or edited, for example to select a particular start and end time of the video.
<br/><br/> At step S2, an icon 151 associated with the content is displayed.  The icon 151 is included in the screenshot 150 shown in FIG. 5a.  The screenshot 150 also includes buttons labelled `exit` 152 and `options` 153, which will be described below.
<br/><br/> At step S3, the dividing module 134 optionally starts to analyse the content in order to determine the potential dividing points or divisions as described above.  Thus, this information may already be available for carrying out some of the
following steps.
<br/><br/> If the content is such that it can be divided in various different ways, then the terminal 100 may provide the user with an option to select a particular way in which the content is to be divided.  In this case, the dividing module 134 may
function accordingly.
<br/><br/> At step S4, the terminal 100 determines whether the user has started to perform an input in relation to the icon 151.  This input is preferably a touch input on the display 102 and, in particular, a sliding input beginning on the icon 151.  In
other words, the input is preferably an input to `drag` the icon 151 across the display 102.
<br/><br/> At step S5, in response to determining that the user has started to perform the input in relation to the icon 151, the terminal 100 causes the icon 151 to start to move across the display 102 in accordance with the input.
<br/><br/> The movement of the icon 151 is preferably constrained such that it can only occur along a specified path.  For example, the specified path may include a sequence of line segments, each of which is parallel to the top edge of the display 102
(e.g., `horizontal`) and is offset from a previous line segment in a direction perpendicular to the top edge of the display 102.  In order for the icon 151 to be moved from a line to a next line, the sliding input may need to be moved diagonally from the
end of the line to the beginning of the next line.  Therefore, the icon 151 can be moved along several of the lines by carrying out a continuous `zigzag` input.
<br/><br/> The specified path may instead take a different form.  For example, the specified path may include a series of `vertical` line segments.  Or, the specified path may include a looped and/or curved path.
<br/><br/> As will be described in more detail below, key frames/images 155 are preferably displayed along the same path as that along which the icon 151 moves.  For example, FIG. 5b shows a screenshot 154 in which a plurality of key frames/images 155 are
displayed along a line along which the icon 151 has been moved.
<br/><br/> The terminal 100 preferably continues to cause the icon 151 to move as long as the input in relation to the icon 151 continues.
<br/><br/> At step S6, the terminal 100 determines whether the icon 151 has been moved forwards along the specified path by a unit of length.  This unit of length preferably corresponds to the length required to accommodate an additional key frame/image
155 on the path.  Thus, the unit of length preferably corresponds to the width of the key frame/image 155 plus any spacing between consecutive key frames/images 155.
<br/><br/> At step S7, if it is determined that the icon 151 has been moved along the specified path by the unit of length, the terminal 100 determines the new key frame/image 155 to be displayed.
<br/><br/> The first key frame/image 155 to be displayed is preferably the one associated with the whole of the content.  For example, the first key frame/image 155 may include the first frame of the video or an image associated with the whole set of
images.
<br/><br/> Information provided by the dividing module 134 may be used to determine the second and subsequent key frames/images 155 to be displayed in one or more of the following ways.
<br/><br/> If the content is a video, then the dividing point with the highest associated `difference` score which is not already represented on the display 102 may be determined.  For instance, if four key frames 155 and so three dividing points are
already being displayed, then the new dividing point may be that with the fourth-highest associated score.  The new key frame 155 to be displayed may be the key frame 155 associated with the part of the video immediately after the new dividing point. 
The key frame 155 associated with the part of the video immediately before the new dividing point is preferably unchanged since it preferably comprises the first frame in the part and this first frame is unchanged.
<br/><br/> If the content is a set of images, then the division of the set of images having the appropriate number of sub-sets may be determined.  For instance, if four key images 155 and so four sub-sets are already being displayed, then the new division
may be the one having five sub-sets.  Preferably, sets of images are divided in such a way that the difference between successive divisions is merely that one sub-set is divided in two.  In this case, the new key image 155 to be displayed is the key
image 155 associated with one of the two new subsets.  If the images are ordered, then the new key image 155 to be displayed is preferably the key image 155 associated with the second of the two new subsets.
<br/><br/> At step S8, the terminal 100 determines whether the key frames/images 155 which are already being displayed need re-positioning in order to appropriately display the new key frame/image 155.  If the content is a video, then this may be the case
if the new dividing point is at an earlier point in time in the video than the start point of any of the parts of the video associated with the displayed key frames 155.  Similar considerations apply if the content is a set of images.
<br/><br/> At step S9, if needed, the displayed key frames/images 155 are re-positioned.  For example, the key frames 155 associated with parts of a video with later start points than the new dividing point are caused to shift along the path along which
the icon 151 has been moved so as to provide a space for the new key frame/image 155 to be displayed.  If necessary, the key frames/images 155 are caused to move from the end of a line to the beginning of a next line.
<br/><br/> At steps S8 and S9, the terminal 100 may also determine whether any of the key frames/images 155 which are already being displayed need to replaced by different key frames/images 155 and, if needed, may do so.  For example, if a part of the
content is to be divided in two as described above, then the associated key frame/image 155 may need to be replaced with a key frame/image 155 associated with the first of the two new parts.  This may be the case if, for example, the key frames/images
155 are not associated with the first frames or images of the parts of the content.  In some instances, the difference between successive divisions may be such that more than one displayed key frame/image 155 may need to be replaced.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the key frames/images 155 are made smaller as the number of key frames/images 155 being displayed increases (and vice versa).  For example, the size of the key frames/images 155 may decrease in a series of steps as the
number of key frames/images 155 exceeds a series of thresholds.  These thresholds may correspond to the number of key frames/images 155 of a particular size which can fit on the display 102.  At the same time, the spacings between the key frames/images
may also be decreased.  At a later stage, the user may be able to zoom into or out of the screen.
<br/><br/> At step S10, the terminal 100 causes the new key frame/image 155 to be displayed at the appropriate position on the path.  The new key frame/image 155 may be added to the end of the series of key frames/images 155 in the space created by the
movement of the icon 151.  Or, the new key frame/image may be added to the middle of the series of key frames/images 155 in the space created by the re-positioning performed at step S9.  In this way the terminal 100 can display a series of key
frames/images 155 wherein the positional order of the key frames/images 155 corresponds to an order of the associated parts in the content.
<br/><br/> The newly-added key frame/image 155 may be highlighted for a period of time and/or until a further key frame/image 155 is added.
<br/><br/> Steps S9 and S10 have been described as occurring after the icon 151 has been moved by the unit of length described above in relation to step S7.  However, the re-positioning and/or replacing of the key frames/images 155 (step S9) and/or the
display of the new key frame/image 155 (step S10) may occur progressively while the icon 151 is being moved.  For example, in the screenshot 154 shown in FIG. 5b, three key frames/images 155.sub.1, 155.sub.2, 155.sub.3 are fully displayed and a fourth
key frame/image 155.sub.4 is partially displayed.  Here, the fourth key frame/image 155.sub.4 is being revealed as the icon 151 is being moved.
<br/><br/> At step S11, the terminal 100 determines whether the input in relation to the icon 151 is still being performed.  For example, a touch input may be considered to continue until the user lifts a finger or a stylus from the screen 102.  If the
input is still being performed, then the operation returns to step S5, thereafter further new key frames/images 155 may be added to the display 102.
<br/><br/> Although not shown in the figures, while the input is being performed, the terminal 100 may determine whether the icon 151 has been moved backwards along the specified path by the above-described unit of length.  If so, then the terminal 100 may
remove the key frame/image 155 that was most recently added and, if needed, re-position and/or replace the other key frames/images 155.  Therefore, the user may be able to add or remove key frames/images 155 to or from the display 102 by, for example,
dragging the icon 151 forwards or backwards along the specified path.  In this way, the user can easily control the number of displayed key frames/images 155.  Moreover, the key frames/images 155 are always correctly ordered.
<br/><br/> After the user has finished performing the input in relation to the icon 151, he/she may be able to perform various inputs in order to perform various actions.
<br/><br/> For example, the user may be able to continue adding or removing key frames/images 155 in the same way as that described above.  At step S12, the terminal 100 determines whether the user has once again started to perform the input in relation to
the icon 151.  In other words, step S12 is similar to step S4 described above.  If the terminal 100 determines that the user has done so, then the operation returns to step S5.  In some embodiments, the icon 151 is no longer displayed after the user has
finished performing the input in relation to it.  In this case, the user may be provided with an option to re-display the icon 151 and hence continue adding or removing key frames/images 155.
<br/><br/> Alternatively or additionally, the user may be able to sub-divide a particular part of the content associated with a particular one of the displayed key frames/images 155.
<br/><br/> At step S13, the terminal 100 determines whether the user has started to perform an input in relation to one of the displayed key frames/images 155.  The input is preferably similar to the input which is used to move the icon 151 (see step S4). 
In other words, the input is preferably an input to drag the key frame/image 155 across the display 102.
<br/><br/> At step S14, in response to determining that the user has started to perform such an input, the terminal 100 starts to perform a series of operations in order to sub-divide the part of the content associated with the key frame/image 155.  This
series of operations may correspond to the operations described above in relation to steps S5 to S11.  However, in this case, the particular key frame/image 155 is moved instead of the icon 151.  The new key frames/images 155 to be displayed may be
determined as described above in relation to step S7 but, in this case, only potential dividing points or divisions which fall within the part of the content which is being sub-divided are considered.  The new key frames/images 155 thus displayed may be
different so as to distinguish them from the other key frames/images 155.  The user may be provided with an option to select a particular way of sub-dividing the part of the content which may be different from the way previously used to divide the
content.  Once the user has finished sub-dividing the key frame/image 155, the operation proceeds to step S15.
<br/><br/> Various actions can involve the user selecting one or more of the displayed key frames/images 155.
<br/><br/> At step S15, the terminal 100 determines whether the user has performed another type of input (a `selecting input`) in relation to one of the displayed key frames/images 155.  This other type of input may be any input which is different from the
input used to move the key frame/image 155 (see steps S13 and S14).  For example, it may involve a short touch on one of the displayed key frames/images 155.
<br/><br/> At step S16, in response to determining that the user has performed such an input, the key frame/image 155 is changed from an unselected state to a selected state or vice versa.  The key frame/image 155 may be highlighted so as to indicate that
it is in the selected state.  For example, in the screenshot 156 shown in FIG. 5c, four key frames/images 155.sub.1, 155.sub.4, 155.sub.7, 155.sub.10 have been selected and highlighted accordingly.
<br/><br/> At step S17, the terminal 100 determines whether the user has performed an input which indicates that an action is to be performed in relation to the selected one or more key frames/images 155.sub.1, 155.sub.4, 155.sub.7, 155.sub.10.  This input
may involve selecting the `options` icon 153 and then selecting from a displayed list of options.
<br/><br/> At step S18, in response to determining that the user has performed such an input, the terminal 100 performs the action.  For example, the user may have selected the option of generating a new video or set of images including only those parts
which are associated with the selected key frames/images 155.sub.1, 155.sub.4, 155.sub.7, 155.sub.10.
<br/><br/> In the screenshot 157 shown in FIG. 5d, a new video or set of images has been generated including only the parts associated with the four key frames/images 155.sub.1, 155.sub.4, 155.sub.7, 155.sub.1.
<br/><br/> The terminal 100 may also provide the user with various options in relation to the new video or set of images.  For example, the user may be able to edit the new video or set of images in a similar way to that described above in relation to the
original video.  The user may be able to add or edit transition effects between different parts of the video.  The user may be able to view the new video or set of images, save the new video or set of images to memory 112, or share the new video or set
of images via a choice of communication means.
<br/><br/> Alternatively or additionally, the user may be able to perform a different input at step S17 and a different action may be performed at step S18.
<br/><br/> For example, the user may be able to perform an input in response to which the terminal 100 causes the part of a video or the sub-set of the set of images associated with a particular key frame/image 155 to be played back or displayed as a slide
show.  This input may involve carrying out a long press in relation to the key frame/image 155 and then selecting from a displayed list of options.
<br/><br/> Other options may also be provided, for example, for deleting the part of the content associated with a particular key frame/image 155 or for deleting all other parts.  An option for re-ordering the parts of the content, for example by dragging
the associated key frames/images 155 across the display 102, may also be provided.  An option for editing a particular part of the content, e.g. a particular set of video frames or images, for example by adding text or other effects may also be provided.
<br/><br/> At step S19, the terminal 100 determines whether the `exit` icon 152 has been selected.  If not, then the operation returns to step S12.  If so, then the terminal 100 takes steps to stop operation of the viewing/editing module 133.  The terminal
100 may require the user to confirm that he/she wishes to exit and also prompt the user to save any unsaved changes to the content or to confirm that he/she do not wish to save the changes.
<br/><br/> At step S20, the operation ends.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 5a to 5d are example screenshots representing different stages of operation of the terminal 100.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5a shows a screenshot 150 which may be displayed at an early stage (see step S2 in FIG. 4) before the content has been divided, or at a later stage after any key frames/images 155 which have been added have been removed or after an option
to restart the editing has been selected.  The single icon 151 shown on the screen may be a generic icon accompanied by text related to the content, for example its file name.  The icon 151 is shown towards the top right corner of the display 102.  Thus,
there is space on the display 102 in which the icon 151 can be moved.  The display 102 is shown in a landscape orientation.  However, the operation described above is similar when the display 102 is in a portrait orientation.  In this case, the number of
key frames/images 155 per line and the number of lines on the display 102 may be different.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5b shows a screenshot 154 in which the user is performing the input in relation to the icon 151 (see steps S4 to S10 of FIG. 4).  Three key frames/images 155.sub.1, 155.sub.2, 155.sub.3 are fully displayed and a fourth key frame/image
155.sub.4 next to the icon 151 is partially displayed.  Although not shown in the figure, each of the key frames/images 155 preferably includes an image.  The key frames/images 155 are shown as touching each other.  However, the key frames/images 155 may
also be displayed with spaces between them.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5c shows a screenshot 156 after the user has finished dividing the content (see steps S15 to S18 in FIG. 4).  The content has been divided into twelve parts and the associated twelve key frames/images 155 are displayed on the screen.  In
this example, the maximum number of key frames/images 155 per line is five.  However, this maximum number may be higher or lower than five.  The user has selected four of the key frames/images 155.sub.1, 155.sub.4, 155.sub.7, 155.sub.10 and these have
been highlighted accordingly.
<br/><br/> In FIGS. 5b and 5c, the key frames/images 155 are labelled with an index that represents their relative position in the series of key frames/images 155.  However, as described above, new key frames/images 155 may be added to the middle of the
series of key frames/images 155.  Thus, for example, the key frame/image labelled 155.sub.3 in FIG. 5b may not be the same as the key frame/image labelled 155.sub.3 in FIG. 5c.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5d shows a screenshot after the user has generated new content, e.g. a new video or set of images, including only the four key frames/images 155.sub.1, 155.sub.4, 155.sub.7, 155.sub.10 that were shown as being selected in FIG. 5c.
<br/><br/> Thus, the above-described embodiments may have the benefit that content such as a video or a set of images can be easily and highly-controllably divided into a plurality of parts.  These parts can then be viewed and/or edited, for example.  The
above benefits are particularly pronounced when the invention is implemented on an electronic device such as a mobile telephone, smart phone, personal digital assistant or tablet, although the principles may be applied to larger devices such laptop
computers, desktop computers and suchlike.
<br/><br/> Numerous alternative embodiments will be apparent to the skilled person, and all such embodiments that fall within the scope of the claims are within the scope of this invention.  Some alternative embodiments will now be described.
<br/><br/> The above-described embodiments may involve a single icon 151.  Instead, in some embodiments, two or more icons, each of which is associated with different content, may be displayed and moved in order to display the key frames/images associated
with parts of the different content.  Thus, for example, the user may be able to generate a new video including a mix of parts from two videos.
<br/><br/> Although in the above videos may be divided into parts based upon a `difference` score and sets of images may be divided into parts based upon their visual content or other characteristics, these are just examples.  The videos or sets of images
may instead be divided into parts using any other suitable method.  In some embodiments, videos may be divided into parts having particular durations dependent upon the total length of the video and the number of key frames 155 to be displayed.  In some
embodiments, sets of images may be divided into parts having particular numbers of images therein.
<br/><br/> In the above-described embodiments, the terminal 100 may cause the icon 151 to move in response to the input in relation to it.  However, the icon 151 does not need to move nor indeed to be displayed at all.  Instead, in some embodiments, new
key frames/images 155 may be displayed in direct response to an input such as a sliding input across the screen.
<br/><br/> Although in the above the inputs for dividing the content and sub-dividing the parts of the content are described as being preferably continuous sliding inputs, this is just an example.  The inputs may instead be performed in any other suitable
way.  For instance, the input may involve selecting a destination point on the display 102 for the icon 151 or the key frame/image 155.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, in some embodiments, the inputs may be performed without using the touch sensitive display 102.  For example, the inputs may be performed using the hardware keys 104.  In some embodiments, the terminal 100 may not even have a touch
sensitive display 102.
<br/><br/> Although in the above the screenshots are described as being provided on the display 102, this is just an example.  The screenshots may instead be projected by a projector (not shown) forming part of the terminal 100 or provided as part of a
peripheral device to the terminal 100.  With the use of such projection, the display 102 may be temporarily disabled, or images may be provided on the display 102 and be projected simultaneously.
<br/><br/> Any two or more of the parts of the functional components may be combined, in which case operations said to be performed by the separate parts are performed by the combined parts.
<br/><br/> It will be appreciated that the above described embodiments are purely illustrative and are not limiting on the scope of the invention.  Other'variations and modifications will be apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reading the present
application.
<br/><br/> For instance, although the above relates to images or video content, similar operations could be performed in relation to other content, such as audio.
<br/><br/> Moreover, the disclosure of the present application should be understood to include any novel features or any novel combination of features either explicitly or implicitly disclosed herein or any generalization thereof and during the prosecution
of the present application or of any application derived therefrom, new claims may be formulated to cover any such features and/or combination of such features.
