<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> 1.  Field of the Invention
<br/><br/> The present invention generally relates to identification and authentication of mobile devices and/or users.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of the Related Art
<br/><br/> When a customer calls a service provider, that customer is often required to enter, to a voice response system or into a touchtone system, identifying information such as a phone number, account number, part of his or her social security number,
etc. before speaking to a representative.  More often than not, the customer is asked to provide this information again when connected with the representative.  This is frustrating to customers and results in a bad customer service experience.
<br/><br/> The same may hold true for employees communicating with other employees who are located remotely.  Due to security concerns, the initiating employee may need to provide identification, such as an employee identification number, to the receiving
employee before discussions can begin.  If such identification is oral, there is a risk of being overheard.

embodiment, the first party may provide the indicia to the second party in an email, webpage, text message, etc.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the indicia may be exchanged by "bumping." For example, if the indicia is received on a first mobile device, it can be "bumped" to a second device (mobile or otherwise) so the second device can provide that indicia to the
other party.
<br/><br/> In step 280, the indicia may be verified.  In one embodiment, the second party may verify that the indicia received from the first party is the same as the indicia that is provided to the second party.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the second party may verify that the indicia match by comparing the indicia displayed versus the indicia that is received.  In another embodiment, the second party may enter the indicia that is received, and the server may
inform the second party whether or not the indicia matches.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, if the second party manually verifies the indicia, the second party may inform the program of such.
<br/><br/> In step 290, the communication may commence.  In one embodiment, a time limit may be placed on the communication, and the parties may be required to be authenticated again if they wish to proceed.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the method may be used by a first party to authenticate a third party to a second party.  For example, a third party, such as a customer of a bank, may visit a branch office to conduct business.  Before conducting business, or
during the process of conducting business, the third party may authenticate himself to the first party by, for example, presenting a photo identification.
<br/><br/> If the first party (e.g., the branch employee), needs assistance from a second party (e.g., a specialist, supervisor, management member, etc.) who is not co-located with the first party in order to assist the third party, the first party may
authenticate himself or herself to the second party as described above.  The first party may then inform the second party that he or she authenticated the third party, and may therefore pass the communication so the second party and the third party can
converse.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3, an example of a code generation and entry interface is provided.  Interface 300 includes button 310 to generate a code, and box 320 to enter a code, along with submit button 330.  In one embodiment, both the first party and

<br/><br/> It is appreciated that in order to practice the method of the invention as described above, it is not necessary that the processors and/or the memories of the processing machine be physically located in the same geographical place.  That is,
each of the processors and the memories used by the processing machine may be located in geographically distinct locations and connected so as to communicate in any suitable manner.  Additionally, it is appreciated that each of the processor and/or the
memory may be composed of different physical pieces of equipment.  Accordingly, it is not necessary that the processor be one single piece of equipment in one location and that the memory be another single piece of equipment in another location.  That
is, it is contemplated that the processor may be two pieces of equipment in two different physical locations.  The two distinct pieces of equipment may be connected in any suitable manner.  Additionally, the memory may include two or more portions of
memory in two or more physical locations.
<br/><br/> To explain further, processing, as described above, is performed by various components and various memories.  However, it is appreciated that the processing performed by two distinct components as described above may, in accordance with a
further embodiment of the invention, be performed by a single component.  Further, the processing performed by one distinct component as described above may be performed by two distinct components.  In a similar manner, the memory storage performed by
two distinct memory portions as described above may, in accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, be performed by a single memory portion.  Further, the memory storage performed by one distinct memory portion as described above may be
performed by two memory portions.
<br/><br/> Further, various technologies may be used to provide communication between the various processors and/or memories, as well as to allow the processors and/or the memories of the invention to communicate with any other entity; i.e., so as to
obtain further instructions or to access and use remote memory stores, for example.  Such technologies used to provide such communication might include a network, the Internet, Intranet, Extranet, LAN, an Ethernet, wireless communication via cell tower
or satellite, or any client server system that provides communication, for example.  Such communications technologies may use any suitable protocol such as TCP/IP, UDP, or OSI, for example.
<br/><br/> As described above, a set of instructions may be used in the processing of the invention.  The set of instructions may be in the form of a program or software.  The software may be in the form of system software or application software, for
example.  The software might also be in the form of a collection of separate programs, a program module within a larger program, or a portion of a program module, for example.  The software used might also include modular programming in the form of
object oriented programming.  The software tells the processing machine what to do with the data being processed.
<br/><br/> Further, it is appreciated that the instructions or set of instructions used in the implementation and operation of the invention may be in a suitable form such that the processing machine may read the instructions.  For example, the
instructions that form a program may be in the form of a suitable programming language, which is converted to machine language or object code to allow the processor or processors to read the instructions.  That is, written lines of programming code or
source code, in a particular programming language, are converted to machine language using a compiler, assembler or interpreter.  The machine language is binary coded machine instructions that are specific to a particular type of processing machine,
i.e., to a particular type of computer, for example.  The computer understands the machine language.
<br/><br/> Any suitable programming language may be used in accordance with the various embodiments of the invention.  Illustratively, the programming language used may include assembly language, Ada, APL, Basic, C, C++, COBOL, dBase, Forth, Fortran, Java,
Modula-2, Pascal, Prolog, REXX, Visual Basic, and/or JavaScript, for example.  Further, it is not necessary that a single type of instruction or single programming language be utilized in conjunction with the operation of the system and method of the
invention.  Rather, any number of different programming languages may be utilized as is necessary and/or desirable.
<br/><br/> Also, the instructions and/or data used in the practice of the invention may utilize any compression or encryption technique or algorithm, as may be desired.  An encryption module might be used to encrypt data.  Further, files or other data may
be decrypted using a suitable decryption module, for example.
<br/><br/> As described above, the invention may illustratively be embodied in the form of a processing machine, including a computer or computer system, for example, that includes at least one memory.  It is to be appreciated that the set of instructions,
i.e., the software for example, that enables the computer operating system to perform the operations described above may be contained on any of a wide variety of media or medium, as desired.  Further, the data that is processed by the set of instructions
might also be contained on any of a wide variety of media or medium.  That is, the particular medium, i.e., the memory in the processing machine, utilized to hold the set of instructions and/or the data used in the invention may take on any of a variety
of physical forms or transmissions, for example.  Illustratively, the medium may be in the form of paper, paper transparencies, a compact disk, a DVD, an integrated circuit, a hard disk, a floppy disk, an optical disk, a magnetic tape, a RAM, a ROM, a
PROM, an EPROM, a wire, a cable, a fiber, a communications channel, a satellite transmission, a memory card, a SIM card, or other remote transmission, as well as any other medium or source of data that may be read by the processors of the invention.
<br/><br/> Further, the memory or memories used in the processing machine that implements the invention may be in any of a wide variety of forms to allow the memory to hold instructions, data, or other information, as is desired.  Thus, the memory might be
in the form of a database to hold data.  The database might use any desired arrangement of files such as a flat file arrangement or a relational database arrangement, for example.
<br/><br/> In the system and method of the invention, a variety of "user interfaces" may be utilized to allow a user to interface with the processing machine or machines that are used to implement the invention.  As used herein, a user interface includes
any hardware, software, or combination of hardware and software used by the processing machine that allows a user to interact with the processing machine.  A user interface may be in the form of a dialogue screen for example.  A user interface may also
include any of a mouse, touch screen, keyboard, keypad, voice reader, voice recognizer, dialogue screen, menu box, list, checkbox, toggle switch, a pushbutton or any other device that allows a user to receive information regarding the operation of the
processing machine as it processes a set of instructions and/or provides the processing machine with information.  Accordingly, the user interface is any device that provides communication between a user and a processing machine.  The information
provided by the user to the processing machine through the user interface may be in the form of a command, a selection of data, or some other input, for example.
<br/><br/> As discussed above, a user interface is utilized by the processing machine that performs a set of instructions such that the processing machine processes data for a user.  The user interface is typically used by the processing machine for
interacting with a user either to convey information or receive information from the user.  However, it should be appreciated that in accordance with some embodiments of the system and method of the invention, it is not necessary that a human user
actually interact with a user interface used by the processing machine of the invention.  Rather, it is also contemplated that the user interface of the invention might interact, i.e., convey and receive information, with another processing machine,
rather than a human user.  Accordingly, the other processing machine might be characterized as a user.  Further, it is contemplated that a user interface utilized in the system and method of the invention may interact partially with another processing
machine or processing machines, while also interacting partially with a human user.
<br/><br/> It will be readily understood by those persons skilled in the art that the present invention is susceptible to broad utility and application.  Many embodiments and adaptations of the present invention other than those herein described, as well
as many variations, modifications and equivalent arrangements, will be apparent from or reasonably suggested by the present invention and foregoing description thereof, without departing from the substance or scope of the invention.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, while the present invention has been described here in detail in relation to its exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that this disclosure is only illustrative and exemplary of the present invention and is made to provide
an enabling disclosure of the invention.  Accordingly, the foregoing disclosure is not intended to be construed or to limit the present invention or otherwise to exclude any other such embodiments, adaptations, variations, modifications or equivalent
arrangements.
