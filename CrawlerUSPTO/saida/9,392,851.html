<br/><br/> In the past 15 years, the mobile telephone industry has grown by leaps and bounds.  The market demand for mobile phone accessories such as faceplates, cases, chargers, and Bluetooth.RTM.  headsets has also proliferated rapidly.
<br/><br/> Since the explosion of Apple's iPhone.RTM.  and its contribution to the phenomenon of app culture, companies large and small are trying to produce devices that facilitate and maximize the use and functionality for consumers and their
smartphones.  For example, one company has recently introduced a "Smartwatch" that connects to a smartphone and can display Twitter feeds, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> updates, SMS, among other things pulled from a smartphone.  Other companies have produced devices that
measure the energy you exert on a daily basis and send it to a smartphone, while also telling the time.  Other devices may track user's daily activity and send the information to a smartphone application.  Other devices that can play music and display
text, the weather and other information from a phone have also been introduced.
<br/><br/> These smart watches primarily serve as a complement to smartphones; for example, they display information such as incoming calls and can control smartphone applications.  As a result, the growth of the smartphone market directly influences
growth of the smart watch market.  The smartphone installed base hence serves as the total available market for smart watches.
<br/><br/> However, many of these fitness and health focused accessories are single purpose.  Further, even though watch-like devices have attempted to bridge the mobile phone and consumer's informational needs but they are more or less "geek-like"
gadgets.  Therefore style-conscious consumers, particularly females, do not take advantages of these unfashionable looking smart watches, Bluetooth headsets, etc.
<br/><br/> Similarly, in the past decade, Bluetooth headsets have transformed to more than just transmitting voice conversation.  In addition to advancing digital signal processing and sound quality, many brands have also attempted to increase battery
life, form factor, and design of its wireless headsets.  Some headsets come with a mini display (usually one or two liner) integrated for displaying caller ID, SMS, phonebook, song title, etc.
<br/><br/> It is also true that most fashion houses and jewelry makers do not have the technical know-how to efficiently integrate their fashion jewelry with digital accessories.  If they try to do it at all, they must outsource or partner with engineering
service firms and/or Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to produce such a combination.  Thus, none has been able to integrate Bluetooth headsets and wireless communication devices with jewelry and fashion accessories consumers enjoy wearing.  It is
believed that (1) the capability and technologies to miniaturize electronic and circuitry is possible today but keeping sufficient battery life increases the physical size of device proportionally and (2) other than the battery, the earbud and related
components take up most of the real estate of the headset casing and industrial design.  Nonetheless, it is a fact that most women and style conscious consumers do not like and want to wear today's Bluetooth headsets and wireless communications devices
in the market today are appealing to primarily to geeks, gadget-lovers, and/or fitness fanatics.
<br/><br/> Further, these smart watches and headsets are all individually engineered from scratch.  This negatively impacts their cost and limits expansion of a full `line` of accessories unless new devices are built in similar boxy form factors.
<br/><br/> What may be needed are ways to hide the earbud or listening device so a wireless headset can seamlessly integrate with fashion accessories and jewelry.  Furthermore, devices for wireless terminals may need to be integrated and incorporated in
jewelry and fashion accessory design, so consumer's daily digital communication needs is infused with such devices and part of their fashion.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY
<br/><br/> The embodiments described herein may relate to an easily interchangeable, versatile platform to enable the design and incorporation of digital communication functionality in fashion accessories &amp; jewelry, without the need to reinvent the wheel
with each new design or develop extensive in-house technical know-how by fashion accessory and jewelry designers.  For example, embodiments of the present application may include an interchangeable, versatile electronics package or platform compatible
with the design and incorporation of wireless digital communication functionality in a wide variety of fashion accessories and jewelry.  This might allow fashion accessory and jewelry designers to not be required to constantly re-design their
form-factors or possess extensive technical know-how to participate in the next wave of the wearable mobile communication market.
<br/><br/> Additionally, some embodiments may include coupling the device platform with an add-on accessory to transform the combined units into a fully functional wireless terminal device, where users can access and control the interlinked wireless

degrees.  In some embodiments, the connector receptacle 230 can rotate up to 180 or 360 degree depending on the form factor and profile of device 100.  This embodiment is advantageous when other add-on devices are better suited or needed for coupling on
the sides rather than top or vice versa.  Unlike the restriction of housing the connector receptacle 230 on the top of devices 202 shown on FIG. 2A-D, integrating such unique design 355 on the four corners as shown on 358 provides the flexibility for
coupling another add-on device on any side, especially when add-on device comprises two male connectors for better stability.
<br/><br/> To avoid electrical contact or signal complications, only contacts of one connector receptacle will be active while the other connector receptacle will temporarily disabled should device 100 detects both connectors are from the same add-on
device unless contacts provides different signals or different use cases.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3L illustrates few embodiments of male &amp; female connectors.  Similar to the slider connector shown on FIG. 3F, it integrates with one or more sides of the device 100 and connectors 312a,313b.  The device or connector can provide one female
360 while the other side provides one male 362 (as shown on 364), or both sides provide females 360, or both males 362 as illustrated on 366 and 368, respectively.  This is advantageous for device 100 to couple with more than one connector, therefore
more add-on devices or battery packs are possible with this embodiment in accordance with the present application.  In some embodiments, such connectors 360, 362 can be incorporated to one or more sides, not restricted to a mandatory or maximum of two
sides.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 4A-4D illustrate different embodiments of earphone 400.  Shown in a perspective view, the earphones 400 on FIGS. 4A and 4B are very similar, both consisting of an earbud 402 and neck 404 connecting to the base 406a, 406b where FIG. 4A
shows a wheel 406a while the base for another embodiment in FIG. 4B is a spherule 406b.  Both bases 406a, 406b enable earbud 402 to be retraction with their rotating nature.  These retractable earphones are integrated with devices 100 in accordance with
embodiments of the present application.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4C provides a side view of an earphone 400 similar to that shown in FIG. 4A, yet with a different form factor of the neck 450, with an ear tip 452 for easier use and comfort with an angled or curved form factor in some embodiments.  Lengths
of the neck 450 may vary while it curves.
<br/><br/> To use the wireless headsets 100, the earphone 400 will be sprung out 454 when the release button 456 is pressed.  The release button 456 may be an integral part of the flip mechanism similar to many of today's automobile remote controller with

<br/><br/> FIG. 4D illustrates another embodiment of wireless headsets 100 where the entire headset 420 can be detached by twisting the base 428 counter-clockwise.  This unique headset design 420 comprises the same components of wireless headset described
on diagram 100 in FIG. 1A.  When headset 420 is not in use, a user can conveniently store it away by placing it back at the end of the inbuilt-battery circular pendant 430, then twisting the headset 420 clockwise to fasten.  While headset 420 is fastened
with the battery-integrated pendant 430, internal battery of the headset 420 can be charged through its electrical contacts 426a and 426b coupled, providing headset's battery source is less than 100% full.  Similarly, integrated battery of pendant 430 is
also charging when it's connected to connector 432 which in turn is connected to the battery-integrated necklace 434 only when both conditions applies: (1) battery source of inbuilt-battery on pendant 430 is less than 100% and (2) inbuilt-battery of
necklace is greater than 0%.  Otherwise, no charging activity occurs between batteries of pendant 430 and necklace 434.  If battery level of pendant 430 is 0% or near zero while headset 420 is coupled with device 430 which coupled to the
battery-integrated necklace 434, headset 420 will be charged via battery source of necklace 434.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5A-5D details various retractable earphone systems in a cross-sectional view in accordance with embodiment of the present application.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5A shows a retracted earphone 502 housed in the wireless headsets 500 which can be integrated to a fashion pendant, earrings, cufflink, and any other wearable fashion accessory.  Earphone 502 contains the speaker portion with transducer 504
and neck 506 where parts or all electronic circuitry and internal rechargeable battery are housed.  In some embodiments, the speaker portion with transducer 504 and/or parts or all electronic circuitry, microphone, and internal rechargeable battery are
housed in other sections 514 of the wireless headsets 500.  The cylindrical neck 506 contains an elastic tap 508 that latches to the lower slot 520 to keep the spring compressed 512a and earphone 502 remains retracted.
<br/><br/> To use the earphone, a user simply presses the release button 510 to allow earphone 502 to spring out from the wireless headsets 500.  Then earphone is pulled slightly outwards and twisted clockwise to fasten earphone 502, where the threads 526
that are convexly integrated around the bottom of the cylindrical neck 506 are interlocked with the outer threads 524 of the concaved wall that uniformly houses the cylindrical neck 504 so earphone 502 is in stable and locked position as shown on the
next Figure.  The speaker portion 504, includes a faceplate 503 with a pattern of apertures for allowing sound to pass through from transducer to the user's ear, placed into eardrum--users can use wireless headsets 500 for voice communication (hearing
and speaking) with connection to mobile telephone 150 or simply enjoy audio content that is transmitting 152 directly from mobile phone 150 to wireless headsets 500 be they a fashion pendant or earrings.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5B illustrates an earphone 502 is ejected and in a locked position where spring is reinstated 512b.  To retract and restore earphone 502 back inside the wireless headset 500, user must twist earphone 502 counterclockwise to unlock threads
526 that are interlocked with the threads 524 of the housing of the earphone 502, then push earphone 502 in until a `click` sound, whereas the elastic tap 508 is moved from upper slot 522 to lower slot 520 where earphone 502 is now in a locked and
retracted state.  When earphone 502 is ejected, a large circular orifice that houses the earphone 502 is visible and, with the neck extension, it creates sufficient space for earphone 502 to comfortably fit in one's ear canal with the outer wall of the
wireless headsets 500 being in the way.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 5C and 5D represent slightly different embodiments.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5C illustrates an embodiment with speaker portion 504 that includes a faceplate 503 with a pattern of apertures for allowing sound to pass through from transducer to the user's ear.  Faceplate 503 is used to direct sound from transducer
toward the user's eardrum, regardless of whether earphone is in user's right ear or left ear.  Speaker portion 504 is operably coupled to the neck 506 of earphone 502 where neck portion 506 can be cylindrical, squared, or in another shape.  This
embodiment does not have threads 526 on the earphone neck like the example shown on FIGS. 5A and 5B, but instead the neck 506 consists of a first elastic tap 508 and a second elastic tap 509.  The matching lower slot 620 is for locking first tap 508 so
earphone 502 can be retracted and in a locked position while storing earphone 502 on a large circular cavity 516 inside the wireless headsets 500.  When lower release button 510 is pressed, the compressed spring 512a causes the earphone 502 to be
ejected.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5D shows the earphone 502 in an ejected state with first elastic tap 608 is stopped by upper left slot 522 so earphone 502 is not ejected much further, which may cause earphone 502 to be departed from housing 514 of wireless headsets 500
while second elastic tap 509 secures the neck 506 via upper right slot 523.  Earphone 500 is ready for use when it's ejected.  To retract the earphone 502, user simply presses the upper release button 511, while simultaneously pushing the earphone 502 in
(downwards) until the second elastic tap 509 is latched with lower right slot 521 in time, when the "clicking" sound is present.
<br/><br/> A sensor or mechanism may be employed on this embodiment where an incoming phone call is automatically answered when lower release button 510 is pressed or spring is fully reinstated 512b, and an active phone call automatically disconnected if
upper release button 511 is pressed or spring is fully compressed 512a as part of the detection mechanism.
<br/><br/> Reduced profile form factor of wireless headsets 500 shown on FIG. 5A-5D may allow integration with jewelry and fashion accessories, where the ability to hide the earphone 502 or wireless headset 500 entirely is beneficial.
<br/><br/> It should be understood that the embodiments described here in accordance with the present application are not limited to a specific and any appropriate designs of earphone and engineering of retractable mechanism.  Examples shown on FIGS. 5A-5D

<br/><br/> Additional Embodiments and configurations are discussed below with respect to FIGS. 101A-108.  Aspects of these embodiments may be similar to aspects of the embodiments discussed above and aspects of any of the embodiments discussed in the
present application may be combined without departing from the scope of the present application.
<br/><br/> As discussed above, smartphone wrist accessories began the process of establishing the `wearable` trend.  The ideal wearable device--at least for consumers--is something sleek, stylish, and comfortable--with the electronic package
interchangeable where consumers can easily remove them and transfer them to another piece of jewelry or fashion accessory to maximize their investment in the digital communication apparatuses as with the embodiments described herein.  As a result,
benefits may be enjoyed by consumers as they are now able to maximize their investments and luxuriate in their digital jewelry and accessories, without having to purchase the electronics package separately for multiple accessory or jewelry items.
<br/><br/> In an exemplary embodiment, a "Device Platform" which includes all the components and circuitry necessary for wireless computing and connectivity, but excluding the battery and display may be provided.  Such components and circuitries may
include, but are not limited to, a printed circuit board, memory, communication interface (e.g., Bluetooth, NFC, etc.), GPS, accelerometer, vibration motor, and processor for executing software that drives a user display interface and content on a screen
(e.g., touch screen), and transmits data to and from interlinked wireless devices (e.g., smartphone) and/or the wireless network itself, when coupled with an add-on fashion accessory providing for a battery source.
<br/><br/> Add-on accessories are a companion apparatus to the device platform.  It can be, but not limited to, a digital pendant, necklet, bracelet, bangle, keychain tag, handbag decoration tag, etc. as discussed above.  Add-on accessories are fabricated
first for their design as a jewelry or fashion accessories--typically houses an internal rechargeable battery and receptacle connector to the device platform's connector and may or may not include a display.  Generally, add-on accessories are not
functional when not coupled with the device platform.  However, in some embodiments where e-paper display technology (e.g., E-Ink) is employed, users may be able to use the add-on accessory's display to show a graphic image/pattern as a wallpaper for
fashion or aesthetic reasons even with the device platform detached and/or without battery power.  The equivalent of a PC opening screen with interchangeable wallpaper backgrounds can become an inherent part of the jewelry or accessory item design or
look.  The wearer could select a color of denim to match different denim outfits or upscale the jewelry or accessory item by selecting different colors and patterns such as pattern of her dress, gold or silver mesh or any combination of one or more
precious or semi-precious stones in place of the denim wallpaper.
<br/><br/> When the device platform is coupled with an add-on accessory, the users will have a fully functional wireless terminal device and are empowered to access and control their mobile phone easily and quickly without ever removing it--even from their
pocket or handbag--whether it be a phone call, music playback, text messages, or social network alerts &amp; updates.  Embodiments may effectively allow a consumer to avoid missing a call or being the last to know about a <b><i>Facebook</i></b> update or important
Tweet--because their phone was in their handbag or pocket for the previous two hours.  Furthermore, in some embodiments of the present application, users may track calories burned, steps taken and other daily movements to monitor health activities--as
well as loss prevention and recovery of mobile phone, accessories, and any apparatuses that are interlinked.
<br/><br/> The device platform or electronics package is constructed in one or more segments or modules that are attached to a flexible strap.  One aspect of the exemplary embodiment consists of four segments (or sections or modules) where all the
components and circuitry for a fully functional computing capability are housed.  The edges of the strap include magnets for convenient and easy removal and then attaching it to various digital fashion accessories having electrical contacts at one or
more ends.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, straps may employ button-like, finger, or other methods for the device platform to adhere to an add-on accessory yet not restrict its use to only using magnets.  A further exemplary embodiment comprises more than one set
of electrical contacts (e.g., one connector on each end).
<br/><br/> The flexible or semi-flexible strap can be a `ribbon cable` shaped to any curvature (upward or downward; or any direction) or function as a straight/flat strap; therefore enabling the device platform to easily adapt and fit into or onto any
shaped cavity (any arc or flat surface) required by the fashion or jewelry design.
<br/><br/> The device platform itself is user interchangeable and adaptive, so that it may be easily removed and coupled with any companion digital fashion accessories (add-on accessories) in a manner referred to herein as "coupling".  Coupling is defined
herein to mean inserting or attaching the device platform to an add-on accessory (digital fashion accessory) so that the device platform is not visible--or at least partially covered by the fashion accessory for aesthetic reasons.  Coupling is defined
herein similar to "docking".
<br/><br/> "Add-on Accessories" defined herein include, but are not limited to, digital bracelets, bangles, pendants, earrings, bag decoration tags, and key chain tags, etc. --and can be any form factor, size, finish, color, material, etc. "Add-on
accessories" herein also may be referred to as "Fashion Accessories", "Digital Accessories", or "Companion Accessories"--and may include built-in display(s), battery, loud speakers, directional microphone, camera(s), sensors (e.g., touch, proximity,
etc.), antennas, memory card slot, etc.
<br/><br/> In accordance with an embodiment of the present application, digital fashion accessories such as bracelets, pendants, and tags may include a display and/or rechargeable battery.  In some embodiments, fashion accessories also house components and
mechanism for wireless charging and with additional antenna(s) integrated for enhanced wireless signals--and may employ more than one display (e.g., LCD, OLEO, e-paper, or combination of display technologies).  Add-on accessories house a receptacle
connector (electrical contacts) for mating with the device platform so power can be supplied from any add-on accessory's integrated rechargeable battery to the device platform as well as transmitting data to and from both coupled apparatuses (device
platform and add-on accessory).
<br/><br/> When a removable device platform is coupled with an add-on accessory, through electrical connections, the battery that is integrated with the add-on accessory powers its components (e.g., display, sensor, button, etc.) as well as the device
platform itself--in turn, full computing functionality is therefore available and operable.  Subsequently, information and user interface can be transmitted (through the same removable, coupled electrical contacts) to the display or displays of the
attached add-on accessory.  As a result, a fully functional `Wireless Terminal Device` is transformed by coupling the device platform with an add-on accessory.  In certain embodiments where one or more described components (e.g., display, camera(s),
etc.) may be omitted on the add-on accessories, these add-on accessories are still fully functional for dedicated use situations and value propositions when coupled with the device platform.
<br/><br/> The user interface may be controlled by a user interacting with the touch display, voice commands, or tactile surfaces of add-on accessories, as well as gestures (motion) control via accelerometer and/or other sensors should physical button(s)
or other mechanism for controlling or navigating the user interface be completely absent from both the device platform and the add-on accessory or due to user preference.
<br/><br/> The user can pair the wireless telephone and wireless terminal device by having them both in contact or close proximity physically.  This can be done using NFC or equivalent technology, and is only required to be performed for the first time
unless the wireless connection is broken or unpaired which then requires re-pairing.  Once paired, wireless connections (e.g., Bluetooth) between wireless telephone and wireless terminal device are active--and users can start using the wireless terminal
device to access and control their wireless telephone.  Alternatively, the `pairing` can be done via Bluetooth pairing or other means.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the wireless terminal device can transmit data to and from wireless telephone via a Wi-Fi network.
<br/><br/> It should be understood, the device platform can also include the cellular transceiver and SIM card integrated--therefore it is a fully-functional wireless communication device with the capability of today's smartphones.  Furthermore, in
addition to digital fashion bracelets, the methods described for building an interchangeable and adaptive device platform can also be used in developing a similar device platform for other companion fashion accessories such as earrings, pendants, key
chain tags, bag decoration tags, etc.) and not limited only to form factors of bracelets and bangles.
<br/><br/> The exemplary embodiments may provide a new and improved method of designing and manufacturing wireless terminal devices (companion terminal devices)--by providing an interchangeable, versatile platform to facilitate the design and incorporation
of digital communication functionality with fashion accessories and jewelry, without the need for extensive in-house technical know-how by fashion accessory and jewelry designers, even OEMs.  The benefits include, but are not limited to: speed to market,
reduced costs and technical risks, and digital accessories/jewelry can be designed with minimal or no technical expertise required.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, device platform may also be easily user interchangeable with any compatible add-on accessories.  No tools or cumbersome assembly and disassembly required to have a fully functional wireless terminal device.  Advantageously,
consumers can maximize their investment by leveraging the "same" interchangeable device platform for numerous bracelets, key chain tags, and bag decoration tags, with different form factor and designs.  The same is true with device platforms for pendants
and other add-on accessories.  In one embodiment, an interchangeable device platform that is designed for a pendant can be coupled and operated with a variety of different pendants as well as other companion fashion accessories such as a brooch, bracelet
or earrings.
<br/><br/> The device platform can be both an interchangeable hardware package that can be removed and coupled with other multi-function companion fashion accessories, or it can be integrated and housed inside certain add-on accessories.
<br/><br/> With reference to FIGS. 101A to 108, various embodiments will now be described in more detail.  Examples are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.  It is understood that the figures and the example embodiments to which they relate are not
intended to limit the systems and methods describe herein to only the described embodiments or visual representations.  To the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope
of the present application.
<br/><br/> FIG. 101A shows a high level electronics block diagram of a device platform in accordance with one embodiment.  This embodiment is designed to transmit digital data or a digital equivalent data language or format to and from wireless
communication or computing devices (e.g., wireless telephones, tablets, Wi-Fi networks, etc.) using their existing wireless air-interface protocol.  In another embodiment, the device platform may be equipped with a cellular transceiver and SIM card,
therefore capable of a fully functional smartphone and capable of transmitting data to and from various cellular networks (e.g., 4G mobile networks) directly or other wireless networks (e.g., Wi-Fi).
<br/><br/> In accordance with another embodiment, the device platform consists of, but is not limited to, a controller, memory (e.g., RAM and SSD/storage), video/audio processor, GPS, vibration motor, accelerometer, sensors (e.g., touch, etc.), various
communication interfaces (e.g., Bluetooth, etc.) as well as a connector (e.g., electrical contracts) to transmit data and electrical signals or pulses to and from receptacle connectors of companion fashion accessories--while in some embodiments, the
device platform may also include a rechargeable battery, power (ON/OFF) button or switch or a microphone for audible commands and instructions, memory card slot (for extra memory storage), and/or speech processor (for voice recognition, speech-to-text,
etc.).
<br/><br/> In addition to Bluetooth air-interface, the device platform also may consists of other wireless interfaces such as Near Field Communication (NFC), Wide Area Local Network IEEE 802.11 standards (e.g., Wi-Fi), Radio-frequency identification
(RFID), cellular network transceiver, and functionally similar future protocols and air-interfaces.
<br/><br/> FIG. 101B shows a high level block diagram of a typical add-on accessory (companion fashion accessory).  Unlike any existing Bluetooth devices in the market today, add-on accessories in accordance with the systems and methods described herein
may include a physical push-to-talk button, or a touch sensor to empower users to activate the integrated speech command function with device platform through the built-in speech processor.  Touch sensors (single point or multi touch) may allow users to
control the device platform without traditional buttons--and can be integrated to the fashion accessory itself, not limited to only on touch display (e.g., speech recognition).
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, add-on accessories such as digital bracelets and bag decoration tags may consist of a display or displays, whereas it can be a touch or non-touch LCD, OLED, or flexible e-paper, while some other embodiments may comprise
of a combination of these display technologies (e.g., part OLED and part e-paper) in accordance with the systems and methods described herein.
<br/><br/> Further in accordance with an embodiment, add-on accessories could house an internal rechargeable battery equipped with a connector for hardwired charging, and/or a mechanism for wireless charging.  Such charging circuitry is capable of
bi-directional charging &amp; discharging--simply put, when add-on accessories are connected to a charging connector or placed on a charging unit (through electrical contacts or wirelessly), it also charges device platform or any other hardware coupled with
add-on accessory, should a rechargeable battery not be present.
<br/><br/> Wireless ear sets (for example, Bluetooth headsets with or without microphone) for listening to audio content transmitted from user's wireless communication device and/or device platform, may be integrated with certain embodiments of companion
digital bracelets, pendants, keychain tags, bag decoration tags, earnings, etc.--as well as companion accessories may include but not limited to: one or more cameras, memory card reader/writer, loud speakers, directional microphone, plug (e.g., 3.5 mm
jack for wired headset with microphone or mini-USB) for audio, data, and/or charging, and sensors (e.g., touch, proximity, audible etc.).  Add-on accessories may also have an additional vibration motor and antenna integrated for stronger vibration and
enhanced wireless communication signals of the coupled device platform--in some embodiments, the vibration motor and antenna may be omitted in device platforms.
<br/><br/> In addition to fashion and new future form factors, companion fashion accessories are essentially digital peripherals that provide a user interface for the device platform and, in general, may not be able to operate independently when decoupled
from device platform therewith.  According to another embodiment, device platforms may be built-in and not detachable from add-on accessories.
<br/><br/> Although many details for the hardware design in accordance with the systems and methods may not been described herein in great detail (e.g., DSP, clock battery, etc.) on the attached high level block diagram, and some functional components may
be omitted here, persons of ordinary skill in the art will realize the minimum components and requirements for building a wireless computing device/computer as related to the systems and methods described herein.
<br/><br/> FIG. 102 Illustrates various views of the device platform.
<br/><br/> In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the device platform consists of computing components segmented into several sections; therefore each section comprises a printed circuit board (PCB) which may or may not itself be flexible and not
rigid, or fully integrated chips with a sheath casing adhered to a flexible strap which enables the device platform to be bent in various directions.  Straps can be made of silicone, polymer, other rubber-like or any materials that are heat-resistant and
may be bent more or less.  In a different embodiment, a rigid strap may be used for a particular form factor including a fixed curvature.
<br/><br/> It should be understood that the device platform can be segmented into various numbers of sections and not restricted to the four sections illustrated herein.  Furthermore, the size (length, height, width) of the device platform may also
vary--any variations would be within the spirit and scope of the present application.  "Section" is defined as a "Module" described above.
<br/><br/> On one end of the module mounted strap, a connector is built-in and is linked to the circuitry of the device platform.  Connectors may comprise eight, fourteen or any number of electrical contacts (pins) which are required to carry a variety of
data and sustainable by the supply power.  Connectors can be magnetized, plug-like, or take any other form-factor or mechanism used for easy and repeated coupling/docking With such a connector, a large amount of functionality can be achieved.
<br/><br/> In other embodiments, the connector may be integrated on both ends of the device platform or provided a different methods for insertion and removable of the electric contacts of the device platform, to and from receptacle electric contacts of
companion accessories.
<br/><br/> Along both sides of the device platform, the strap might consist of magnets so when it's placed near the orifice of a companion fashion accessory, the magnetized strap will snap onto or into the companion accessory.  Instantly the male connector
(electrical contracts) of the device platform is coupled with the receptacle (female) connector (electrical contacts) of the companion accessory, therefore data and electrical current transmission between the device platform and coupled companion
accessory is now possible.  It may be designed so that no tools are required for inserting or removing the device platform so that the device platform is easily interchangeable from one piece of accessory to another by the user.  Connectors of the device
platform and add-on accessories can be male &amp; female, female &amp; male, male &amp; male, female &amp; female, or any variation so long as they can be mated/coupled.
<br/><br/> The flexible strap with or without the magnets on it may allow for an easy snap coupling of the device platform with the companion fashion accessories for a snug fit.  In the case of a digital bracelet or bangle, the flexible strap may also
allow a concave shape for a comfortable and an uninterrupted experience when users are wearing it on their hands or body.  The various modules or packages can also be connected by a ribbon cable or comparable direct solder-to-trace technique.
<br/><br/> In addition to magnets, other methods and mechanisms may be used to secure the device platform inside or onto companion fashion accessories.
<br/><br/> FIG. 103A exemplifies various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein.  A fully functional fashion accessory, also referred to as a `Wireless Terminal Device`, requires a device platform coupling with a digital companion
accessory.
<br/><br/> For example, when the device platform is coupled with a circular open bangle, as shown in the top embodiment shown in FIG. 103A, a fully functional digital bangle is ready for use provided the bangle's internal battery is not fully discharged
and connector and receptacle connectors are in contact without any obstruction.
<br/><br/> The "same" device platform can be easily decoupled from the circular bangle (by pulling the device platform's strap away from a dimple of the inner side of companion accessory) and then insert it to the square bangle for another full function
fashion accessory, as shown in the middle embodiment of FIG. 103A.
<br/><br/> Digital bangles/bracelets can be any size, thickness, or form factor and not limited to only the square and circular open form factors shown here.  The body of the bangles/bracelets can be rigid or flexible.  It should also be noted that the
device platform can be interchanged from one companion accessory to another so long as the companion accessories have the compatible connector and orifice--even though companion devices have different curvature surfaces.  For instance, the "same" device
platform that was used in the square and circular open bangles can be inserted in compatible keychain tags and bag decoration tags, for another form of full functional fashion accessory, as shown in the lower embodiment of FIG. 103A.
<br/><br/> Such a versatile and interchangeable device platform may be an advantage for both jewelry and fashion accessory makers, as well as to consumers.
<br/><br/> FIG. 103B illustrates the similar device platform which can be employed with smaller fashion accessories like earrings and pendants.  The methods of building a smaller device platform is essentially the same as building the device platform shown
and used in FIG. 3A.
<br/><br/> One "small" device platform can be incorporated and used in numerous digital fashion accessories.  For example, the `same` small device platform can be used, for example, on a necklet, pendant A and pendant B--and can also be adapted to ear ring
A, B, and C, as illustrated.
<br/><br/> The "same" smaller device platform can also be incorporated to endless add-on accessories, so long as the add-on accessories provide a compatible connector and/or orifice for the smaller device platform to be inserted/housed--regardless of the
form factor, design style, with or without display, type of fashion accessories, etc.
<br/><br/> All pendants and earrings house a retractable ear set and when coupled with the small device platform, they transform to fully functional wireless headsets--yet still look like elegantly designed fashion jewelry or accessory.  In some
embodiments, pendants may be designed for use with a wired headset with or without wireless head set integrated.
<br/><br/> The methods and systems for developing device platforms for digital bracelets and hand bag decoration tags can also be employed to earrings, pendants and other fashion accessories with smaller device platforms.  Such smaller device platform may
or may not be equipped with reduced functionality.  For instance, digital accessories such as earrings and certain pendants do not have a display; therefore a video processor may or may not be built in on such small device platforms.
<br/><br/> FIG. 104 is a simplified flow chart illustration of the functional operation of the device platform when coupled with an add-on accessory in accordance with an embodiment.  When both of these apparatuses are coupled, they become a fully
functional wireless terminal device.
<br/><br/> To use the wireless terminal device, users need: 10401) To couple the device platform with the desired add-on accessory whether it be a square bangle, oval bracelet, pendant, handbag decoration tag, etc. 10402) After both the device platform is
coupled with an add-on accessory, now power from one or more built-in battery of the add-on accessory supplies and powers the device platform.  10403) User now can turn on the wireless terminal device (either by pushing a button or via other means such
as voice command or touch/motion sensor on add-on accessory or directly on device platform).  10404) Data now can be transmitted to and from the device platform and add-on accessory through the same coupled connectors that transmit power currents, the
device platform obtains add-on accessory identifiers.  10405) The device platform determines whether coupled add-on accessory is authentic.  If NO (authentication fails) pairing occurs, then the operation is aborted (10407) and the wireless terminal
device can be made non-functional.  If YES (authentication passes), Device platform obtains information (10406) about coupled add-on accessory (such as component drivers like speaker(s), microphone, proximity and other sensors, together with display type
&amp; size, number of displays, etc. if present) 10408) Device platform then determines which characteristics and what functionality can be used with a particular coupled add-on accessory based on information obtained during prior steps.  10409) Now the
add-on accessory is authenticated and the wireless terminal device is fully functional and ready to use.
<br/><br/> User can access and control the wireless terminal device via the touch screen interface or through other touch mechanism.  Furthermore, user also can use voice commands to call for certain actions.
<br/><br/> Should users need to recharge the internal rechargeable battery of any add-on accessory, users can attached it with compatible charging adapter or place it on a wireless charging platform--with or without the device platform actually coupled.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 105A and 105B show link relationships between wireless terminal device, wireless headset, and wireless telephone.  Wireless terminal device is when an add-on accessory is coupled with a device platform and transformed into a fully
functional but specifically featured hardware device.
<br/><br/> FIG. 105A illustrates potential communication links between wireless telephone, wireless terminal devices (add-on accessory device platform), and wireless headset where wireless terminal device is the central hub.  The wireless telephone can
transmit data to and from the wireless terminal device--in turn the wireless terminal device can also wirelessly communicate with integrated or 3rd party wireless headset (e.g., Bluetooth headsets).  User may use a wireless headset to control and access
certain functions of the wireless telephone via a wireless terminal device.  For instance, user could activate or end a phone call by pushing a button on the wireless headset or speaking a command.  Furthermore, user could select certain applications
directly from the wireless headset.
<br/><br/> FIG. 105B shows link connections between wireless telephone, wireless terminal device (add-on accessory device platform), and wireless headset where wireless telephone is the central hub.  Wireless telephone can transmit data to and from
wireless terminal device- and simultaneously communicates with wireless headsets.
<br/><br/> In this configuration, users may utilize the wireless headset with the wireless telephone, with or without the presence of a wireless terminal device.
<br/><br/> It should be noted that the configuration shown on FIG. 105A may be easily reconfigured to FIG. 105B and vice versa.  This can be done by pairing the wireless headset either directly with the wireless telephone or wireless terminal device.
<br/><br/> While embodiments of communication links are wireless signals, wired and physical connections may be employed in other embodiments.  Furthermore, a wireless terminal device may be equipped with a cellular receiver, Wi-Fi or other wireless
interfaces to communicate directly with the cellular, Wi-Fi or other wireless networks with or without the presence of a wireless telephone.
<br/><br/> FIG. 106A-108 illustrates various alternative designs and embodiments of the present design in a bracelet/bangle form factor.
<br/><br/> FIG. 106A illustrates a straight view of a square bangle 10605 with integrated removable wireless ear set 10615 detached (with retractable ear bud 10620 ejected) while a device platform 10610 about to be inserted into the add-on accessory
(square bangle) 10605.
<br/><br/> FIG. 106B shows a perspective view of the same square bangle with the wireless ear set coupled to the bangle.  Moreover, this drawing also exemplifies a user-interface on one of the four displays (top screen 10625) while the other display (front
screen 10630) shows an illustrative Louis Vuitton pattern used as a wallpaper.
<br/><br/> In accordance with an embodiment, an oval form factor of the bangle 10705 without integrated wireless ear set is shown on FIG. 107 while another circular but open bangle 10805 with a smaller form factor wireless ear set 10810 illustrates another
embodiment shown on FIG. 108.
<br/><br/> It should be understood that companion accessories can be of any form factor, any size, built with any materials, and can have different shapes and curvatures--while digital bangles can be open or close, square or round, etc. But all variations
may be coupled with the same device platform whereas its flexible strap allows the adaptive characteristics.  Therefore such a device platform not only can be coupled and used with bracelets/bangles, it can be removed, coupled and used with keychain
tags, bag decoration tags, certain pendants, and other compatible companion accessories.
<br/><br/> In so far as the description above and the accompanying drawings disclose any additional subject matter that is not within the scope of the single claim below, the inventions are not dedicated to the public and the right to file one or more
applications to claim such additional inventions is reserved.
<br/><br/> Although a very narrow claim is presented herein, it should be recognized that the scope of this application is much broader than presented by the single claim.  It is intended that broader claims will be submitted in one or more future or
continuation applications that claim the benefit of priority from this application.
<br/><br/> The present application has been described with reference to certain preferred and alternative embodiments that are intended to be exemplary only and not limiting to the full scope of the present application.
