       <p> Portable interactive devices of audience members are remotely operated to
     substantially "simultaneously" respond to a signal from an origin, e.g.,
     a central server, despite variation in latencies among the devices in
     order to produce a shared experience. The audience members are reached
     through varying communication links. Latencies vary among portable
     interactive devices and among carriers. A firing time for the portable
     interactive devices is selected to occur at a time in the future. An
     execution time at which a respective portable interactive device is
     commanded to operate is a function of the firing time minus the latency
     control signal reaches clients in a venue in an audience or at a remote
     location simultaneously despite the varying latencies.

<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> 1.  Field of the Invention
<br/><br/> The present subject matter relates to a system, method, and non-transitory, machine-readable medium for execution on a digital processor producing a synchronized experience for multiple client devices in communication paths subject to differing
latencies.
<br/><br/> 2.  Related Art
<br/><br/> There are many applications in which one or more servers communicate with a large number of clients.  It may be desirable to have these devices operate in synchronism.  There are many different results which can be achieved from synchronization.
<br/><br/> U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,090,878 discloses a method and system for synchronizing many clients to one central server.  In this arrangement, the central server must download client software to each electronic device to be synchronized.  The client
software allows the electronic device to perform data synchronization with the server.  After the synchronization is complete, the client software may be removed from the electronic device.  Downloading the client software to each client device is a
cumbersome process.  After the client software is removed from each electronic device, synchronization is no longer provided.
<br/><br/> United States Published Patent Application Number 2010/0074278 discloses a network element which synchronizes a number of clocks within a system and supports multiple independent timing domains.  The network element must act as a master clock to
which other clocks are slaved.  The network cannot account for initial time differences among the clocks.
<br/><br/> Reliable and convenient synchronization of multiple client devices such as would be useful in a shared experience has not been provided.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Briefly stated, in accordance with the present subject matter portable interactive devices are remotely operated to substantially simultaneously respond to a signal from an origin despite variation in latencies among the devices in order to
produce a shared experience.  The origin may comprise a central server.  In the present description, "simultaneously" refers to the width of a preselected time window within which target devices will respond to the signal.  The audience members are
reached through varying communication links.  Links may include Wi-Fi and cell phone carriers.  "Latency" as used in the present description describes the time it takes for a signal from a server to reach a circuit point in a respectable portable
interactive device which is responsive to the signal.  Latencies vary among cell phone models and carriers.  The present subject matter allows a server to send a control signal that will reach clients in a venue and an audience or at a remote location
simultaneously despite the varying latencies.
<br/><br/> The server sends signals and collects the range of offsets of the various devices through use of a timing device such as a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server.  A "firing time" is selected at which all client devices will execute a command. 
Further forms of the present subject matter may provide additional feedback from the client devices, e.g., smartphones, to the server to more precisely control the "simultaneous" response.
<br/><br/> Events triggered at the firing time may include sending messages and alerts to all clients, causing all the phones to vibrate, and flashing the photo flashes of all the phones in synchronism.  In a further form, messages and alerts are sent to
client devices as well as commands.  The devices query the server in order to determine the time offset from the host.
<br/><br/> The operation may be repeated continually in order to provide dynamic response to changing conditions and to accommodate new devices coming online in the network.  An evolving experience is provided to the users. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Communicating with an audience is a relatively recent phenomenon.  A concert performance control system may wish to communicate with audience members over portable interactive devices, e.g., smartphones.  The present subject matter overcomes
significant problems in achieving an enhanced audience experience.
<br/><br/> One application of the present subject matter is to produce simultaneous outputs from a plurality of client devices.  One example of a plurality of client devices is a group of portable interactive devices, e.g., cell phones, each having a
display.  A composite display distributed over the plurality of devices may be designed so that an optical effect in a venue is achieved.  For example, a central system could command that every device display a logo of a band that is currently
performing.  Alternatively, different displays could be commanded at the same time for subgroups of devices.  The present subject matter provides for synchronization of responses of the portable interactive devices so that the desired effect is achieved. The operation to synchronize responses is preferably performed over successive operating cycles.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1, consisting of FIGS. 1A and 1B, is an illustration of a venue 10 comprising a system 2 in accordance with the present subject matter.  FIG. 2 is a high-level block diagram of communication paths in the system illustrated in FIG. 1.  FIGS.
1 and 2 are discussed at the same time.  The system 2 may be used in conjunction with a live event, for example a concert.  Two-way interactivity is provided between a central server 8 and individual audience members 4 who may each have a portable
interactive device 6.  The central server 8 includes a central clock 9.  The portable interactive device 6 may be a smartphone, tablet, or other device.  The present subject matter addresses providing reliable, high-capacity, synchronized interaction in
a highly efficient manner.
<br/><br/> The venue 10 may include a stage 12, audience area 14, a control room 16, and a media system 18 which may be located in the control room 16.  The media system 18 receives audio, video, and intelligence from sources and may be operated to perform
control room functions such as mixing, selecting, and processing.  A video program 20 is shown on a display 22.
<br/><br/> The media system 18 is used to couple outputs from a video source 26, a sound source 28, and other intelligence source 30.  The video source 26 may comprise one or more television cameras 24.  In the present illustration, a media source 34
includes the video source 26, sound source 28, and other intelligence source 30.  The sound source 28 comprises audio output from a live performance provided by a performer or performers 40 coupled by transducers 42, such as microphones.  Alternatively,
one or more of the video source 26, the sound source 28, and other intelligence source 30 may comprise sources of streaming content, prerecorded content, stored data, or currently processed content from any source.  These sources may be local, remote, or
both.
<br/><br/> In one preferred form the display 22 is a screen 50 that comprises a backdrop for the stage 12.  The display 22 could comprise an array 52 of screens over which the video program 20 is distributed.  In another form, often used in arenas, the
display 22 could comprise a display unit 56 which includes a plurality of monitors 58 on one support 60, with each monitor 58 facing in a different direction.  Examples of the display unit 56 are available under the trademark Jumbotron.RTM..
<br/><br/> The media system 18 is operated by a VJ 70.  The VJ 70 may comprise one or more personnel or a programmed computer.  It is not essential that the control room 18 be located at the venue 10.  The media system 18 provides content to a concert
network controller 100.  The concert network controller 100 may both receive and transmit information.  The concert network controller 100 provides an input to a display link 102, which is coupled by a patch panel 104 to the display unit 56.
<br/><br/> The concert network controller 100 may also comprise a Wi-Fi hotspot 120 providing and receiving signals to and from an audience area 14.  As further described below, content may be provided both to and from audience members 4.  The concert
network controller 100 may also interact with remote participants 140.
<br/><br/> The concert network controller 100 is preferably wirelessly connected to an event server 130, which can provide communications between remote participants 140 and the concert network controller 100.  The event server 130 is coupled to a content
editor 134, which interacts with a staging server 136.  The staging server 136 may be coupled to the remote participants 140 by a network, for example, the Internet 144.  The Internet 144 may utilize Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers 41 (FIG. 3).  The
event server 130, the content editor 134, and the staging server 136 are collectively referred to as a communications server 138.
<br/><br/> Communications will be provided between a target system and a source system.  In the present description, "source system" is a device that wishes to send a message to a "target system." The target system is a device that is configured to receive
sent messages in its operating-system via a network connection sub-system.  Systems may include portable interactive devices 4 or the central server 8.  The business logic running on the device can operate as the target or the source system at any
moment.  Operating as a source system or target system for a particular messaging transaction does not preclude operating as the other system for a different messaging transaction simultaneously.
<br/><br/> In a nominal application, thousands of portable user devices 6 may communicate with the concert network controller 100.  The communication will provide interaction for intended uses of the system 2.  This alone could strain resources and require
expensive T1 access lines of a quality exceeding that of the commercial grade DSL capacity normally utilized within a concert venue.  Providing such capacity would be both expensive and impractical.  Additionally, users 4 have the option to operate their
portable user devices 6 in order to access the Internet and to access cell phone services.  It is important to limit bandwidth requirements to accommodate a large number of portable user devices 6.  This can be accomplished by disabling access to
applications that are not part of the entertainment functions of the system 2.  For purposes of the present description, the applications contributing to functioning of the system 2 are referred to as business logic.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a block diagram of one embodiment of a communications system providing interaction with both local and remote users.  The communications server 138 is coupled for networking the central server 8 to the Internet 144 via one or more
preselected communications networks 51.  NTP host servers 41 provide time synchronization for the communications networks 51.  The communications networks 51 are the networks which forward signals to individual devices.  The communications networks 51
may include networks 51-1 to 51-n, where n is an integer.  In the present illustration, the network 51-1 is a 4G cell tower.  The network 51-2 is a 3G cell tower.  The network 51-3 is a Wi-Fi access point.  These forms of networks are merely exemplary. 
Each portable interactive device 6 receives a signal from a network 51.
<br/><br/> Latencies can range from a time period approximating zero up to several seconds, or minutes, or more.  In the present system, a firing time is selected so that portable interactive devices 6 will react to the signal from the communications
networks 51 at the same time.  The reactions occur "simultaneously." More specifically, the reactions occur within a time window of preselected width.  A nominal value for the width of a window, e.g., 0.1 second, is generated as further described below. 
Implementation of a selectable firing time is further discussed below.
<br/><br/> The platform supports transmission of command execution messages to both remote participants 140 and the at-venue participants 4.  The at-venue participants 4 utilize mono-cast Internet Protocol (IP) and multi-cast User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
to transmit messages over the captive Wi-Fi network 120 which requires the deployment of a stand-alone Wi-Fi network suitably architected for the venue.  Handling the potentially hundreds-of-thousands of remote users is generally not possible since it is
common for venues to provide consumer-grade DSL Internet connections.  The large load that such a large number of users would place on the main venue server, namely the event server 130, would also be untenable.  Instead, all messages destined for
external participants 140 are handled by a separate staging server 136 that need not be installed in or resident at the venue 10 itself.  The staging server 136 may instead be resident at an external service provider which can dynamically scale to match
the required external participant user-load.  The external service can comprise "cloud" service from providers such as Rackspace.RTM.  or Amazon.RTM.  AWS.
<br/><br/> When sending messages to internal users, the event server 130 will send one additional message to the staging server 136 specially structured so the staging server 136 will subsequently send that message to all registered external participants. 
In this way single messages from the event server 130 can be broadcast to an arbitrary number of external users 140 without placing any additional burden on the at-venue infrastructure.
<br/><br/> A number of different software packages may be used in order to command actions at client devices from a server.  One application is Remote Professional from mobileways.de.  This app performs such functions as making calls from the computer via
the client device.  Another form of software is embodied in an application called MyMobiler.  This software enables a computer to select and open applications on a smartphone.  An Android app called AirDroid by Sand Studio enables control of smartphone
apps from a connected computer.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 4 through 8 disclose sequential steps in the provision of signals bearing intelligence to be displayed by the portable interactive devices 6.  In FIG. 4, the controller 16 sends a command A to the communications server 138.  This command
may include accessing information from a preselected location within a memory in the controller 16.  The command A is included in a package which will include information to invoke display of information, e.g., a band logo and a firing time.  Firing time
is a time at which the portable interactive devices 6 will operate simultaneously.  In the present context, "simultaneously" means that the portable interactive devices 6 will all operate within a predetermined time window.
<br/><br/> As seen in FIG. 5, the portable interactive devices 6 query the communications server 138 for any new commands which have been issued during a current operating cycle.  FIG. 6 illustrates sending a command to show the preselected display at the
firing time.  As seen in FIG. 7, each portable interactive device 6 tracks time via a central clock 9.  Each portable interactive device 6 monitors the central clock 9 so that it will fire the preselected time after it receives the command A (FIG. 4). 
Preferably, there is a central clock 9 within each portable interactive device 6.  Commanded actions could alternatively or additionally include receiving messages and alerts; flash the device's flash lamp, and vibrate the phone.  As seen in FIG. 8, each
portable interactive device 6 executes the command to display the band logo.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating the manner in which portable interactive devices 6 access and utilize information.  The operation of FIG. 9 is continuously repeated.  The portable interactive devices 6 are client devices; they are each
referred to as a client.  Different portable interactive devices 6 will follow the same procedure.  An operating cycle begins at block 150.  At block 152, the portable interactive device 6 senses whether the Internet is available.  If not, operation
proceeds to box 154, where a failsafe mode is invoked.  In a failsafe mode, the portable interactive device 6 selects its own firing time.  The firing time may be the same as that in a previous operating cycle.  Alternatively, algorithms may be provided
to select a computed firing time that may be a function of firing times of previous operating cycles or a function of previously received offset information from the NTP host servers 41.  The failsafe mode provides an approximation of the firing time
which would be provided when the various stages are interconnected by the Internet 40.
<br/><br/> At block 156, each portable interactive device 6 receives and recognizes time offsets from each NTP host server 41.  This is important since latency will vary from one communications path to another.  On the Internet, time transfer delays are a
function of variable parameters such as the level of server traffic and network bottlenecks.  NTP is designed to compensate for some, but not all, network time delays between the host servers 41 (FIG. 3) and each client portable interactive device 6. 
Across local area networks, NTP can yield precision of simultaneity within a few milliseconds.  Latency may be measured in a number of different ways.  The portable interactive device 6 may send a time-tagged signal to each NTP host server 41.  To
compute latency, the portable interactive device 6 may compare its own clock time to Internet time when a response is received.  Other techniques are available.
<br/><br/> At block 158, the acceptability of the deviation is measured.  For example, the acceptable deviation could be defined by an offset time included in the signal sent to the portable interactive devices 6 in FIGS. 4 and 6.  Alternatively, a maximum
acceptable latency could be predefined and included in the application installed on the portable interactive device 6.  If the deviation is not acceptable, operation returns to block 156 where offset time is again measured.  If the deviation is
acceptable, operation proceeds to block 160 at which commands are obtained from the central server 8.  This corresponds to the steps illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6 above.
<br/><br/> At block 162, the portable interactive device 6 compares current time with the firing time.  If the current time is later than the firing time, a failure is detected.  Operation proceeds to block 164 where a failure message with latency is sent
to the central server 8 and the device is entered into the failsafe mode at block 154.  At block 166, the device monitors current time to determine if the firing time has been reached.  When the current time equals the firing time at block 168 the
command is performed.  Operation returns to block 160 where the portable interactive device 6 will look for the next command at the communications server 138 in a next operating cycle.
<br/><br/> The central clock 9 also allows solution of problems in traditional distributed multiplayer gaming.  In a shooting game in which players are instructed to "draw-and-shoot" their weapons as soon as they see a special signal appears either on the
big screen 58 at the venue 10 or on their respective portable user devices 6.  A timestamp signal from the central clock 9 may be associated with each "BANG" message.  A winner is determined by comparison of time stamps rather than by the arrival time of
their "BANG" messages at the central server 8.  The effect of sporadic latencies which have plagued the prior art are minimized or eliminated.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10, consisting of FIGS. 10A, 10B, and 10C is a flowchart illustrating operation at the central server 8.  Functions which can be invoked synchronously include flash, vibrate, camera recording, video playback, audio playback, audio
recording, visual display of audio analysis, visual display of text messages, and visual display of audience demographics on the individual portable interactive devices 6 or on the large screen 50.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10A illustrates launch and operation to provide commands from the central server 8.  FIG. 10B illustrates monitoring by the central server 8 of the total of connected clients.  FIG. 10C illustrates adjustment of the delay to define a
maximum latency that will be accommodated.
<br/><br/> As seen in FIG. 10A, operation is launched at block 170.  At block 172, Internet status is checked.  If there is no connection, operation proceeds to block 174.  The controller enters the above-described failsafe mode.  When the Internet
connection is available, operation proceeds to block 176 where the central server 8 gets time offset signals from each NTP host server 41.  Acceptability of the deviation is compared at block 178 to an acceptable level, i.e., a level that does not exceed
a preselected tolerance.  If the deviation is not acceptable, operation returns to block 176 to see if operation may proceed with an acceptable latency.
<br/><br/> If the deviation is acceptable, operation proceeds to block 180.  At that point, the central server 8 waits for commands from the control room 16.  After a command is received, the command is sent to the communications server 138 at block 182. 
Operation then returns to block 180 where the central server 8 waits for a command during a next operating cycle.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10B illustrates monitoring by the central server 8 of the total of connected clients.  At block 184, a new message is received in response to connection from a new client, and other portable interactive devices 6.  One preferable way to
produce this signal which is received is to have the portable interactive device 6 generate a new connection message in response to activation of the video communication application.  The new client connection message indicates that the total number of
connected client portable interactive devices 6, has increased.  This may be indicated by incrementing a client account register by 1.  The client account register provides an input within the central server 8, and the central server 8 implements a video
function to be provided utilizing the updated number of portable interactive devices 6.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10C illustrates adjustment of the delay to define a maximum latency that will be accommodated.  At block 190, the central server 8 receives a message when latency of a command signal reaching a client portable interactive device 6 is too
great.  This signal is produced as illustrated in FIG. 9 at blocks 162 and 164.  At block 192, the central server 8 receives signals to update a storied, calculated percentage of these failures as defined in FIG. 9.  Further processors compute a new,
larger latency in order to allow the latencies of all the devices with a preselected range to be included in the process of responding to a command.  The preselected range may be a function of a number of standard deviations among the measured latencies.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 is a block diagram of the structure of a packet 200 which may comprise a command A (FIG. 4).  The packet 200 is made up of a plurality of blocks in succession.  The order of blocks is based on a particular protocol.  Other orders could
be provided.  Blocks 202 and 204 respectively carry a message ID and message name.  Block 206 is a nonce value for authenticating devices to each other.  Block 208 identifies a current application, and blocks 210 and 212 respectively contain current
values.  These values could comprise, for example, the command A.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 illustrates a register message 240 which is sent between a client portable interactive device 6 and the controller for establishing a connection for exchanging information.  The order of the following blocks is preferred in common
protocols.  The order is not essential.  Block 242 is a message ID having a numerical value.  Block 246 carries a message name.  Block 248 is a nonce.  In an outgoing message, block 248 comprises the nonce provided with the last response.  In an incoming
message, block 248 is the nonce which will be used in the next outgoing message.  Block 250 identifies a subsystem from which a card message originated.  Block 252 describes a user ID, which will generally identify a particular piece of hardware.  Block
254 carries a password.  Block 258 is a device token that is used in connection with steering a signal to a proper destination, and block 260 identifies a device type.  Blocks 262 and 264 respectively carry a code for the success of registration of one
device with another and a string of data to provide a user-readable message.  Block 266 provides a unique registration number for the device to be used in subsequent communications.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 is a block diagram of a client subsystem 300.  A CPU 302 communicates via a device interface 304 to a display device screen 306.  The display device screen 306 is included in the controller as illustrated in FIG. 13.  A user interface
308 provides data to the CPU 302.  The user interface 308 may comprise the central server 8 (FIG. 1B).  A communication adapter 320 receives incoming data which can be stored on disk storage 322.  Stored data is coupled to an input/output adapter 324. 
Data can be loaded into RAM memory 326 for processing by the CPU 302.  The CPU 302 may produce data for both incoming and outgoing purposes.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 is a block diagram of a controller subsystem 400.  A CPU 402 communicates via a device interface 404 to a display device screen 406.  The device interface 404 may also function as a user interface that provides data to the CPU 402.  A
communication adapter 420 receives incoming data which can be stored on disk storage 422.  Stored data is coupled to an input/output adapter 424.  Data can be loaded into RAM memory 426 for processing by the CPU 402.  The CPU 402 may produce data for
both incoming and outgoing purposes.
<br/><br/> In accordance with the present subject matter, the message structures of FIGS. 11 and 12 may be implemented in new ways.  Preparation of messages requires construction and de-construction of objects with several types of operating parameters
many of which are irrelevant to the operation of business logic.  Creation and transmission of messages within the application space can be accomplished without requiring knowledge of the message construction or de-construction process.
<br/><br/> Message-aware applications are provided with high-level objects implementing a standard interface for accessing per-message and common message parameters.  This interface behaves as a familiar access method on the object providing interrogation
of messages 240 (FIG. 12) for fields such as individual names fields, setting of named fields, interrogation and setting of common fields, access to error conditions, or other fields which may be included among fields 242 through 266 (FIG. 12).
<br/><br/> Once constructed, the framework provides a simple mechanism to initiate transmission of the message to a set of targets.  Ways of defining sets of targets are further described below.  The framework further provides simplified access to received
messages, also further discussed below.  In the communications server 138 (FIG. 2) messages are placed into an outgoing transmission queue; received messages are placed into the incoming queue and delivered to the appropriate business logic as defined by
the message.
<br/><br/> The controller-only framework includes provision to segregate client portable interactive devices 6 and other devices into arbitrary groupings based on any provided metric.  The grouping may be based on types of hardware, accessible information
regarding users 4, or other indicators.  Standard metrics include: device role, e.g., primary controller, Jumbotron.RTM., OCS, or client; gender; age; location within a venue; device type, e.g., iOS, Android, or HTML5; device family, e.g., iPhone 3G,
iPhone5, iPad, or the like; and randomly selected set members.
<br/><br/> In addition, the framework allows the creation, collection, and persistence of arbitrary metrics for use as segregation criteria.  Individual devices can be added or removed from any grouping as desired.  Groups are independent and can overlap
in any manner desired.  Once defined, the grouping can be used as targets for specific commands.
<br/><br/> Once received by portable interactive devices 6, commands are queued and executed according to the timing of the individual received message.  Portable interactive devices 6 register simple handlers for each type of command expected which are
then invoked at the appropriate time and without business logic intervention.  Client device business logic is provided all message information including per-message specific data to affect the desired operation.  Business logic can implement any type of
operation without regard to how and when the message was received.  Messages received by portable interactive devices 6 after the assigned execution time are returned by the framework to the originator for off-line analysis.
<br/><br/> Specific time messages are executed at a specific moment in time as indicated as part of the sent message.  This is the most common form of message in the present system and enables the synchronized execution of commands.  The stated time of
execution is relative to the standard clock 9 (FIG. 1B).  Each device has its offset from this standard clock and executes the command at that appointed time.  Messages received or processed after their assigned execution are logged and sent back to the
sender with diagnostic information.
<br/><br/> The present system creates a relationship between the time at which a command is issued and the time at which the command will be executed.  When constructed, messages can be assigned time-dependent execution values of: upon receipt; upon
receipt with priority; a time in the future after receipt; or a specific time.  The point in time in the future beyond receipt may be set by data provided with the message.  Received messages are each time stamped upon arrival and executed at the future
time.
<br/><br/> In one illustration in which latencies range from 0 to 15 seconds, the system may be programmed to command a firing time that is 20 seconds later than the time at which a command is provided from the central server 8.  A portable interactive
device 6 for which a latency of 15 seconds has been measured can be commanded to respond 5 seconds after a command is received.  A portable interactive device 6 for which a latency of 9 seconds has been measured can be commanded to respond 11 seconds
after a command is received.  The portable interactive devices 6 will use their internal clocks to count to a firing time.
<br/><br/> There are several major hurdles preventing the general adoption of synchronous, event-driven applications in the mobile space.  First among these is the inherent clock-drift and time delta between different devices even those on the same
carrier's network and in the same location (FIG. 3).  Mobile devices can be as much as several minutes off between adjacent devices.  Additionally, the clock drift experienced by an individual device can be noticeable over timeframes as short as
tens-of-minutes.  While this does not affect typical mobile device operations such as email, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> or web-browsing it will completely destroy the shared visceral experience provided by the present system platform.  The present system framework
enables third party developers to tap into the excitement and action of live events by using a proprietary RESTful API to hook into the messaging, topological, and demographic data provided to deploy new and unique apps.
<br/><br/> To counter the clock synchronization problem, the current platform library automatically computes clock deltas between all participating devices against a common master clock and maintains very close synchrony for the duration of the event. 
This auto-negotiation is managed by the library itself without any work needing to be done by resource-consuming applications.  Dependent upon close clock synchronization is the ability of commands to be executed simultaneously at a designated time in
the future by all participating devices or all participating devices in a particular group.
<br/><br/> To support this requirement, all command execution objects in the present system implement a common "execute" method that adds the contained command to an internal queue of commands that are scheduled to be executed at the scheduled time.  The
framework provides additional methods to remove, repeat, or change a given command as well as a call-back so that the system can be notified when a given command has been executed.
<br/><br/> Another major hurdle is the central distribution of messages.  An individual mobile device, while remarkable for its power and size, does not have the processing capacity required to manage and maintain communications between potentially several
tens-of-thousands of devices active at any given venue.  The system provides a sophisticated back-end that enables application development teams to utilize functions of business logic deployment, the aforementioned synchronized command execution,
abstracted database table definition and creation, generalized table access (supporting all CRUD operations), selective message transmission (based on role, physical location, age, device type/capability, custom), registration, historical demographic
retrieval, etc. The deployment infrastructure allows dynamic deployment of new functions without requiring a server restart; synchronized command execution automatically places a future command execution timestamp on each outgoing message to be handled
by the client-side library.  In addition, both mono-cast and multi-cast message groupings can be created depending on the specific needs of the application.
<br/><br/> A final hurdle for any application is the client-side software to handle the client-side business logic and render the results.  The front-end foundation provides an abstract environment for the acceptance, initiation, and processing of
messages.  The framework provides a scaffold which handles reception of messages and makes them available to the specific application business logic as events to be processed.  The application developer is free to concentrate on the business of
implementing functionality.  The present system provides needed commands for decoding incoming messages, time synchronism, or sending new messages.
<br/><br/> By using both the back-end and front-end foundation framework, mobile application developers can create never before imagined applications because the foundational components are already written.
<br/><br/> The system presented provides support for the following areas: clock-drift; message transmission; message construction; command execution; command timing; device family segregation; data access; configuration; and capabilities.
<br/><br/> Devices present within a given environment may deviate from a standard clock by many seconds even those connected via the same cellular tower (FIG. 3) or other technology.  While sufficient for most device-centric operations it is insufficient
for the closely time-synchronized operations possible within the system environment.  To counter this inherent time difference, the System framework provides a standard clock with low-latency access mechanisms and a back-ground correction process to keep
the device clock within a certain configurable window.
<br/><br/> Device operating-systems do not typically expose low-level access to the system clock to effect an actual change to the time setting.  This is not a problem since the system requires only knowledge of the time delta between the standard clock
and the device clock; the delta is stored within the system foundation and is used for the synchronized execution of commands.
<br/><br/> As the clock on each device is inaccurate even over the period of several hours, the system foundation will resynchronize the delta periodically to keep within a predetermined maximum time delta.  A more precise delta requires the
re-synchronization of the clock on a more rapid schedule to ensure minimal drift.  This time delta is configurable within the framework and is transmitted to participating devices upon registration or upon change of the value at the central location.
<br/><br/> The system framework provides simplified access to data stored by the back-end.  Business logic is isolated from database mechanisms and can request specific data as needed.  The data access framework supports the creation of arbitrary data
elements (groupings, commands, etc.) for later reference by name.  This can be used to send a specific complex or often-used command or to define a grouping of devices.
<br/><br/> The system framework supports configurable items that are transmitted to the affected devices automatically upon registration, event start, change to the item, or on-demand.  Standard items are: maximum clock-drift; video effect fade period; and
device family parameter limits such as frames/second, camera, and screen resolution, etc.
<br/><br/> When transmitted, any device-specific items are included to ensure the business logic is able to properly operate on the different platforms.
<br/><br/> The system framework has a capabilities database for known devices.  The database is continually updated with new devices.  Capabilities allow the devices to fail gracefully when a command parameter is unable to be executed due to physical
device limitations.  The capabilities framework provides default sensible behavior for features unavailable on a given platform.
<br/><br/> The previous description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention.  Various modifications to these aspects will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined
herein may be applied to other aspects without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.  For example, one or more elements can be rearranged and/or combined, or additional elements may be added.  A wide range of systems may be provided
consistent with the principles disclosed herein.
