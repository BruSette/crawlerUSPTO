<br/><br/> The World Wide Web has matured into an integral part of daily life for users around the world.  The Internet may be used for commerce, social transactions, and sharing of multimedia content.  For example, electronic commerce has grown
significantly in recent years.  Consumer commercial transactions that occur over the World Wide Web or use protocols that leverage the Internet such as SMTP (email) are collectively known as "electronic commerce." The current model for electronic
commercial transactions typically involves one merchant and one consumer engaging in a one-to-one transaction in which a consumer selects a set of goods and/or services and pays for those goods and/or services through the merchant, and the merchant
fulfils the order.  The Internet may also be used to facilitate merchants' ability to target potential consumers for commercial transactions.  A merchant may customize advertisements and provide the advertisements to selected users.  In Google.TM. 
AdWords, for example, the merchants' customized content may be selectively displayed based upon search terms users provide to Google.TM..  The content provided also provides a mechanism for users to access the merchants' site and, therefore, make
purchases.  Similarly, affiliate marketing allows a promoter to serve up a static text/image link to a visitor that allows for a click through to a page set by an Organizer.  If the visitor takes action as set by the Organizer (visits a page, completes a
form, conducts a transaction, etc.) an Affiliate Marketing firm tracks this action that takes place on the Organizer's server and completes a transaction based on the agreement between the Organizer and Promoter.  After an action is taken by a Visitor,
the Promoter's text/image link is in no way modified to reflect this incremental action or changes in form, function, and content based on this incremental action.  Such commercial mechanisms may be considered to be one-to-many, allowing a single
merchant to reach a large number of consumers.
<br/><br/> The World Wide Web has also experienced tremendous growth as a social media.  As a social media, the World Wide Web provides a vehicle for sharing user generated content, such as through blogs, personal profiles, videos, podcasts, and the like. 
Platforms for sharing user generated content, such as Blogger, Myspace, YouTube, and <b><i>Facebook</i></b> have been developed and benefited from this growth.  Other mechanisms for facilitating social interactions, such as eVite, have also grown.  Using eVite, for
example, an organizer may set up an event, sent invitation emails to potential participants, manage RSVPs, estimate budgets, and perform other functions related to the event via dedicated pages on eVite.  Moreover, social media and fundraising combine in
social payments to raise money for a variety of causes.  Social media may be used to provide "Blogathons" that raise money for charities, political campaigns, allow musicians to appeal directly to their audience to underwrite albums, raise money for
schools, parties, clubs and sports teams, or other causes.  In such social payment transactions, organizers may solicit funds from other individuals visiting blogs or sites.
<br/><br/> In order to display media for a variety of purposes, conventional widgets may be used.  The conventional widgets are often used to display content from a widget owner to a user.  For example, a user may load a page, or site, containing the
conventional widget and view content, such as video, provided by the conventional widget.  Conventional widgets are generally embeddable, portable applications that often run without access to a user's file system.  The conventional widget may be
copyable by users.  Thus, a user may copy a widget from a site to a location of the user's choosing, for example the user's own blog.  Conventional widgets are also generally small in size and less complex than typical applications, such as email or word
processing applications.  However, there is typically no agreed upon limitation in size or complexity for conventional widgets.  Such widgets may be used, for example, by bloggers to share
<br/><br/> Although electronic commerce and social transactions are possible via the World Wide Web, there are drawbacks.  Many social and electronic commerce transactions involve many-to-many relationships.  Such relationships are not well supported by
current electronic commerce and social media platforms.  In addition, the ability of tools, such as widgets, to reflect individual users' tastes may be limited.  Consequently, users' ability to engage in social, commercial, and other transactions
including sharing of multimedia content may be limited.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, what is needed is a method and system for facilitating social and commercial transactions via the Internet.  The present invention addresses such a need.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> A system and computer implemented method for providing a widget are described.  The method and system include receiving a configuration of the widget and rendering the widget on a site.  The widget is for dynamically displaying multimedia
content, is embeddable, and is copyable.  The configuration includes an event with which the widget is associated.  The multimedia content includes at least one updatable tracking mechanism for the event.  In another aspect, the method and system include
providing a widget maker, a database, and at least one server.  The widget maker receives the configuration of the widget.  The database stores data for the widget.  The server may be used for rendering the widget on a site.  In another aspect, the
widget includes at least a first field and a second field.  The first field includes at least one updatable tracking mechanism for the event with which the widget is associated.  The second field dynamically provides additional multimedia content.  In

<br/><br/> FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary embodiment of a system 100 for electronically performing transactions utilizing widgets.  The system 100 may be used for various transactions such as electronic commerce, social payment transactions (e.g.
fundraising), affiliate marketing, other social transaction such as sharing of multimedia, blogging, or other activities.  The transactions may be performed through a variety of electronic media, for example via the Internet, through a cell network,
using mobile phones, desktop computer systems, PDAs, laptop computer systems, or other electronic systems.  Such transactions relate to events.  For example, an organizer such as a particular cause or charity may desire to use the system 100 for events
such as a fundraising campaign based only on Internet contributions, blograising performed in conjunction with a traditional (non-Internet based) fundraising campaign, campaigns that drive and track traffic to a particular Web site, campaigns that drive
and track visitor actions, campaigns based on the occurrence of a particular event such as an ongoing fundraising campaign, in a campaign of limited duration, or for other purposes.  Similarly, a couple getting married may use the system 100 to share
information about the wedding and/or multimedia from the wedding itself, track guests, or otherwise communicate with interested individuals.  In affiliate marketing, a business or other entity termed an organizer may use the system 100 serving up dynamic
content to users, or viewers, of sites in the system 100.  In order to facilitate such electronic transactions, the system 100 allows a widget owner to configure a widget, allows the widget to be disseminated, and may manage payments, rich media, and/or
other data transmitted through the widget.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment shown, the system 100 includes a provider 101.  The provider 101 allows a widget owner to configure a widget, may host a widget, may enforce rules relating to the widget, may store data related to the widget owner, and perform
other tasks related to the widget.  The widget owner might be the organizer of the event or campaign and/or a content provider owning one of the widgets in the system 100.  Coupled directly to the provider 101 are a site, or blog, 120 corresponding to a
widget owner, a provider hosted blog 130, additional blogs 140 and 150.  The widgets 122, 132, 142, and 152 are provided on blogs 120, 130, 140 and 150, respectively.  In addition, blogs 120A, 120B, 120C, 130A, 130B, 130C, 130D, 130E, 140A, 140B, 140C,
and 140D are shown as indirectly coupled with the provider 101.  The blogs 120A, 120B, 120C, 130A, 130B, 130C, 130D, 130E, 140A, 140B, 140C, and 140D include corresponding widgets 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and
142D, respectively.  The coupling with the provider 101 of the sites 120, 130, 140, 150, 120A, 120B, 120C, 130A, 130B, 130C, 130D, 130E, 140A, 140B, 140C, and 140D indicates that the widgets 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B,
142C, and 142D, respectively, are copies rather than physical connections.  For example, the widget 122A is a copy of the widget 122.  Thus, blogs 120A, 120B, 120C, 130A, 130B, 130C, 130D, 130E, 140A, 140B, 140C, and 140D may receive content from and
provide content to the provider 101 directly.  In addition, for simplicity a single widget 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D is associated with each blog 120, 130, 140, 150, 120A, 120B, 120C, 130A, 130B, 130C,
130D, 130E, 140A, 140B, 140C, and 140D, respectively.  However, in another embodiment, multiple widgets (not shown) may reside on a single site.
<br/><br/> The provider 101 includes a widget maker 102 that may have a corresponding widget panel 112, tracking and/or payment subsystem 104, proxy server 106, and a database 108.  The provider 101 might also provide a corresponding payment page 110, for
example if transactions involving payment are provided through the provider 101.  Thus, the widget maker 102, tracking and/or payment subsystem 104, widget panel 112, and database 108 may be controlled by and accessed through the provider 101.  The owner
of the provider 101 may, for example, charge a fixed fee or a percentage of donations for use of and services provided in connection with the system 100.  Although shown together at the provider 101, the components 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, and 112 may be
remotely located and/or owned in whole or in part by another entity.  In another embodiment, at least some of the components 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, and 112 might be omitted.  Use of such components also depends upon the transactions for which the
system 100 is utilized.  For example, if the system 100 is utilized for sharing of content not involving financial transactions and payment, the payment page 110 and payment portion of the subsystem 104 might be omitted.  In addition, although only one
of each component 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, and 112 are shown, multiple versions may be provided.  In an alternate embodiment, the tasks of the components 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, and 112 may also be divided in another manner.
<br/><br/> The widget maker 102, as well as the widget panel 112 may be used to configure widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D.  For simplicity, the widget maker 102 is described in the
context of the widgets 122, 132, 142, and/or 152.  In operation, the widget owner utilizes the widget maker 102 in order to generate and customize the widget 122, 132, 142 and/or 152.  In one embodiment, the widget maker 102 provides the widget panel
112, which is a user interface that allows the widget owner to provide input to the provider 101 to customize the widget 122, 132, 142 and/or 152.  In one embodiment, the widget panel 112 is a page that allows the widget owner to select features of the
widget 122, 132, 142, and/or 152.  For example, the color, shape, event(s)/campaign(s) or other externalities associated with the widget 122, 132, 142, and/or 152, rich media, level of detail and other aspects of the widget 122, 132, 142, and/or 152 may
be set based on the widget owner's elections in the widget panel 112.  For example, the widget owner may specify that the widget 122, 132, 142, and/or 152 is to be associated with specific event(s), data sources, and/or content and may provide a profile
for the type of events and/or content with which the widget 122, 132, 142, and/or 152 may be associated.  The widget owner may also specify the location of fields, data within the fields, colors, and other features of the widget 122, 132, 142, and/or 152
through the widget maker 102.  Thus, a single widget 122, 132, 142, and/or 152 may be configured to display information related to multiple events, ad campaigns, or other items in which the widget owner is interested.
<br/><br/> The tracking and payment subsystem 104 may be used to track various attributes of the widgets and, in some embodiments, to make payments through the widget.  For example, click throughs, number of times viewed, copies, or other ongoing
attributes related to the widget may be tracked using the tracking and payment subsystem.  In addition, the tracking and payment subsystem 104 may be utilized in managing the payments made and the payment page 110.  The payment page 110 may be used to
perform financial transactions, such as making payments and/or contributions associated with the widgets.  The tracking and payment subsystem 104 may authenticate users and/or forms of payment, track payments, validate extraction of funds, validate and
track payments and forms of payment made to content providers, and otherwise manage the actual funds provided to an event or paid out from an event.  In one embodiment, the payments may be validated and held by the owner of the provider 101 or other
designated third party (not shown) until a particular condition is fulfilled, for example the end of the fundraising campaign, sale, or other event.  In such an embodiment, a widget owner may be allowed to extract some or all of the funds.  In an
alternate embodiment, payments may not be considered made and extraction of funds may not be allowed until the event closes.  Further, the tracking and payment subsystem 104 may allow payments to content providers (e.g. widget owners of copies), widget
owners of ancestor widgets, and/or other designated entities in a variety of forms including but not limited to cash or the equivalent, gift cards, or other items.  The payment features provided through the tracking and payments subsystem 104 may include
allowed forms of payment, event tracking, rules for extracting funds, the look feel of the payment page, and other data relating to payment.  Although described as a single subsystem 106, the tracking and payment functions may be split into multiple
subsystems.
<br/><br/> The proxy server 106 may be used to replicate the widget(s) to other sites not associated with the widget owner or provider 101.  For example, the proxy server 106 may be used to provide the widget 142D in the blog 140D.  Furthermore, in one
embodiment, the proxy server 106 may allow content, such as rich media audio or video, from site(s) not directly associated with the provider 101 to be played on the widgets.  In one embodiment, widgets may communicate directly through the proxy server
101, for example to disseminate comments, donation amounts, and/or other information.  Individual components of the provider 101 are discussed further below.
<br/><br/> The database 108 may store data relating to the widget owner and the widgets hosted by the provider 101.  For clarity the database 108 is described in the context of the widget 122.  Thus, the database 108 may store the parameters and other data
corresponding to the widget owner's selections for the widget 122, the identities of each widget and widget owner, as well as other data related to the widget owner.  Thus, the widget data may be considered to include owner selected widget features,
payment features (if any), and event features (if any).  For example, widget features may include the content such as rich media displayed on the widget, thermometers or other mechanisms selected for tracking the progress of the campaign, colors,
specific content providers authorized to host the widget, profiles of content providers authorized to host the widget, parameters related to updating the widget, and other data used in customizing the widget.  The widget owner may also specify parameters
corresponding to the ability of copies of the widget 122 to be customized.  These parameters may also be stored in the database 108.  Also stored in the database 108 may be relationships between widgets.  For example, the database 108 may store the
identity of the widgets 122, 122A, 122B, and 122C as well as an indication that 122A is a copy of 122, and that 122B and 122C are copies of 122A.
<br/><br/> Although not separately shown, the provider 101 may include other components.  For example, the provider 101 may include server(s) for rendering, authenticating, and performing other functions related to the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A,
122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D.
<br/><br/> As discussed above, the sites 120, 130, 140, 150, 120A, 120B, 120C, 130A, 130B, 130C, 130D, 130E, 140A, 140B, 140C, and 140D contain corresponding widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and
142D, respectively.  The widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D dynamically display multimedia content.  In one embodiment, the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B,
132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D are analogous to conventional widgets in that the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D are used to display multimedia content, may be
embeddable and portable, may be copyable, may be small in size, and may be less complex than typical applications.  In one embodiment, the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D may thus be
embeddable code snippets, for example Flash, HTML, XML, XHTML, SBML, .NET, Java, JavaScript, JSP, VisualBasic Applet or analogous applications.  The widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D
may be embeddable in a multitude of architectures, for example web pages, mobile phones, PDAs, and/or provided via email.  In addition, because the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D are
embeddable, they may be self-replicating in nature.  The widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D may also be viewed as the content appearing on the corresponding site 120, 130, 140, 150,
120A, 120B, 120C, 130A, 1320, 130C, 130D, 130E, 140A, 140B, 140C, and 140D, respectively, when the widget 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D is rendered.  In addition, although described herein
as being rendered on a site that may be accessed through a browser (not explicitly shown), the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D may not be limited to such environments.  For example,
the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and/or 142D may reside on a desktop, mobile phone, or other environment.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the system 100, the widgets 122, 142, and 152 may be original widgets initially configured by their owners, rather than copies of another widget.  For example, the widget owner's site 120 includes a widget 122 that is
provided by the provider 101.  Similarly, the sites 140 and 150 include the widgets 142 and 152, respectively, provided by the provider 101.  In the embodiment shown, the widgets 122, 142, and 152 are configured by the widget owner(s) through the widget
maker 102.  Configuration of the widgets 122, 142, and 152, particularly as it relates to copies of the widgets 122, 142, and 152 is discussed below.  In another embodiment, the widgets 122, 142, and 152 may be copies of another widget.  For example, the
widgets 142 and 152 might be copies of the widget 122.
<br/><br/> The provider hosted site, or blog, 130 is shown as including a widget 132.  For the purposes of describing the system 100, the widget 132 is related to the widget 122.  In another embodiment, the provider hosted site 130 may include other
widgets, for example corresponding to the widgets 142 and 152.  As a result, every widget and/or it corresponding event might have its own URL.  This unique address may be tied to a widget owner or individual and may symbolize a particular event or
campaign.  In one embodiment, the widget 132 and the widget 122 are substantially identical.  In another embodiment, aspects of the widget 132 may be different from the widget 122.  For example, the colors used or placement of fields may differ.  These
differences may be based upon the widget owner's preference as established during initial configuration of the widgets 122 and 132, or at some later modification of the widgets 122 and 132.  In one embodiment, the widget owner configures both the widgets
122 and/or 132.  In one embodiment, the widget owner may choose to have only the widget 122, only the widget 132, or both the widget 122 and/or 132 rendered on the sites 120 and 130.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the widgets 122, 132, 142, and 152 are made using the widget maker 102.  As discussed above, the widget owner may access the widget maker 102 through the widget panel 112.  The widget maker 102 offers the widget owner the
opportunity to provide parameters used in customizing the widgets 122, 132, 142, and/or 152.  For example, the color, multimedia to be provided, tracking mechanisms allowed, ability of the widgets 122, 132, 142, and/or 152 to be copied, modifiability of
the copies, inclusion of fields, location of fields, and other features of the widgets 122, 132, 142, and/or 152 may be specified through the widget maker 102.  These parameters may be stored by the provider 101, for example in the database 108.  In one
embodiment, the widgets 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D may be customized, at least to a limited extent, in a similar fashion.  In addition, customization of a particular copy may be limited or otherwise
controlled by customization of widget(s) from which the copy is derived.  Such customization may take place through the widget maker 102 and/or through a widget editor (not separately shown in FIG. 1), which may allow for customization of copied widgets
but not generation of new widgets.  The widget editor may be considered to be part of the widget maker 102 or may be a separate component.
<br/><br/> Although the original code from the widget maker 102 may reside with the provider 101, the widgets might be copied to other site(s).  For clarity, such copying is discussed primarily in the context of widget 122.  In one embodiment, the widget
122 may be copied through a field within the widget 122.  In another embodiment, the widget 122 may be copied via the proxy server 106.  In yet another embodiment, the widget 122 may be copied either through a field within the widget 122 or via the proxy
server 106.  Alternatively, a separate mechanism for copying the widget 122 might be provided.  For example, the blog 120A includes a widget 122A that is a copy of the widget 122.  Similarly, the blogs 120B and 120C include widgets 122B and 122C,
respectively, that are copies of the widget 122A (and thus the widget 122).  The blogs 130A and 130B include widgets 132A and 132B, respectively, that are copies of the widget 132.  Blots 130C, 130D, and 130E include widgets 132C, 132D, and 132E,
respectively, that are copies of the widget 132A and thus the widget 132.  The blogs 140A and 140B include widgets 142A and 142B, respectively, that are copies of the widget 142.  In addition, in one embodiment, copies can be made of previously copied
widgets.  For example, the blogs 140C and 140D include widgets 142C and 142D, respectively, that are copies of the widget 142A (and thus the widget 142).  In one embodiment, the widget 142 might be a copy of the widgets 122 and/or 132.  Alternatively,
the widget 142 may be a distinct widget hosted by the provider 101.  Thus, the widgets 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D are copies of the widgets 122, 132, and 142.  Stated differently, the widgets 122, 132, and
142 are ancestors of the widgets 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D.  As used herein, an ancestor widget is a widget from which another widget is copied.  The widget, or copy, may but need not be updated based upon
changes to the ancestor widget.  For example, changes to an ancestor widget may, but need not, be pushed in real time to copies.  In addition, multiple generations of ancestor widgets may be formed.  For example, both the widgets 122 and 122A are
ancestors of the widgets 122B and 122C.  The widgets 122B and 122C are thus second generation copies of the widget 122 and first generation copies of the widget 122A.
<br/><br/> Although described as copies, the widgets 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D may not be identical to the widgets 122, 132, and 142.  Instead, the widgets 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E,
142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D may be customized, at least to a limited extent, by the owners of the widgets 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D.  In particular, a widget owner may set the parameters of the widget 122,
132, and/or 142 to control the customization of copies 122A, 122B, and 122C, copies 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, and 132E, and copies 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D, respectively.  Such customization is described below.
<br/><br/> The provider 101 may be able to push data to one or more of the widgets 122, 132, 142, and 152, as well as to the widgets 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D.  Thus, data may be pushed to all of the widgets
122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D or a selected portion of the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D.  In order to determine to
which widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D data is to be pushed, the relationships between widgets may be tracked and stored, for example in the database 108.  For example, suppose data
related to changes to the widget 122 is to be pushed only to first-generation copies.  In such an embodiment, the relationship between the widgets 122 and 122A as well as the relationships between the widget 122 and the widgets 122B and 122C is utilized
to determine that data should only be pushed to the widget 122A.  Consequently, the relationships between, or ancestry of, the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D may be tracked and/or
stored by the provider 101.  The ability to push data to widgets and/or their copies may be determined by the widget owners.
<br/><br/> Further, a widget 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and/or 142D may be pushed to selected content providers (otherwise known as promoters) based upon the widget owner's preferences and
characteristics of the content providers.  These content providers may be considered to be widget owners for the copies of the widget on their site.  For example, suppose the widget owner of widget 142 wishes to obtain contributions for a political
campaign.  The widget owner may indicate that certain sites having compatible political views, that are known to reach a particular audience, that relate to a particular geographic area, and/or that have a requisite level of effectiveness in obtaining
contributions are desired.  Such sites may be blogs 140A, 140B and 140C.  Further, the content providers of the blogs 140A, 140B, and 140C may agree to host widgets for particular causes.  If there is a match between the preferences of the widget owner
and the content providers of the blogs 140A, 140B and 140C, the provider 101 may push the widget 142 for the political campaign to blogs 140A, 140B and 140C.  Thus, the widgets 142A, 142B, and 142C may be provided.  In return, the content providers (e.g.
owners of the sites 140A, 140B, and 140C) may receive payment for hosting copies of the widget 142.  In order to determine to which widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D were pushed to
which sites, the relationships between widgets may be tracked and stored.  For example, the widget 122 may be desired to be pushed to the site 120A, thereby providing widget 122A.  Consequently, the relationship between the widget 122A pushed to the site
120A and the widget 122 may be stored in the database 108.
<br/><br/> Thus, a widget 122, 132, 142, 152 and any copies may have both many-to-one and one-to-many capabilities.  Stated differently, a single widget may be associated with multiple events, widget owners, or campaigns.  In addition, a single fundraising
event/campaign or events for a single organizer may be displayed on multiple widgets.
<br/><br/> Data may also be encrypted by the data source provider and decrypted by the widget 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and/or 142D based on private/public key cryptography, encryption, DES
variants, passwords, or other secure means.  Each widget 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D may also have identifiers, for example in a header.  These identifiers may, for example, associate a
widget with particular widget owner(s), particular widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D, particular event(s), and/or particular content provider(s).  Thus, the identifiers may indicate
from which ancestor widget a particular widget 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D was replicated.  The identifier may include multiple generations of ancestors and/or indicate where in the family tree of copies the
widget fits.  Thus, the ancestor relationships, such as parent-child relationships between widgets, as well as the degrees of separation between the generations of copies and their ancestor(s) may be tracked.  The identifiers may, therefore, control of
widgets 122, 132, 142, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D based upon their relationships to other widgets in the family tree.  The identifiers may also allow the widget 122, 132, 142, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B,
132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D to be validated and controlled, for example by the provider 101 and/or widget owner.  When a user accesses a site, such as the site 120A, the provider 101 may render the widget 122A based upon the
configuration selected by the owner of the ancestor widget 122 and the owner of the widget 122A, render the widget 122A based on preferences of the content provider, accept content from the widget 122A, allow and track payments via the widget 122A, push
content to the widget 122A, and perform other tasks using the widget 122A, as described below.  Analogous controls may also be exercised over copies of the ancestor widget.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 depicts an exemplary embodiment of a widget 180 that may dynamically display multimedia content.  The widget 180 may thus correspond to one or more of the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A,
142B, 142C, and 142D depicted in FIG. 1.  Thus, the designations 180 and 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and/or 142D may be used interchangeably herein.  Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the widget 180
includes fields 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, and 198.  The widget 180 may also include other information (not shown in FIG. 2) such as the header described above.  The widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E,
142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D may include some or all of these fields 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, and 198 as well as other fields (not shown).  Moreover, although only one of each field 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, and 198 are shown,
multiple versions of one or more of the fields 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, and 198 might be included.  For example, multiple rich media fields 198, multiple images/content fields 196 and multiple fields 182 for tracking an event associated
with a widget may be included.  In addition to the fields 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, and 198, the color and other aspects of the widget 180 may be customized.  Configuration of the fields 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192 194, 196, and 198 may
thus be part of customization of the widget 180.  For example, the inclusion of, size, and placement of the fields 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, and 198 may differ between the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C,
132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D.
<br/><br/> The field 182 may be used in tracking attributes related to the widget 180 or widget(s) from which the widget 180 was copied.  For example, an event associated with the widget 180, such as a fundraising campaign, may be tracked in the field 182. The tracking mechanisms, such as a thermometer, status bar, and/or count down clock, may provide real time views of the event in the field 182.  Other features that may be tracked and depicted, for example in the field 182 may include data such as a
fundraising or other goal, event start time and duration, and the type of output for each event.  Upon a refresh request and/or periodically based upon a widget owner and/or provider set preferences, the event progress tracking mechanisms in the field
182 may be updated by the provider to reflect any changes in the event.  For example, upon donation from any of the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D depicted in FIG. 1, the provider
101 may push data to all (or some subset of) the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D to reflect the change in the amount received.  Thus, the level of a thermometer or status bar in the
field 182 may change based upon real-time events.  The tracking mechanisms can be provided for the campaign(s) associated with the event or provider, sub-campaigns, as well as other externalities that are of interest to the widget owner.  For example,
the owner of the widget 122A may initiate a sub-campaign for a fundraising campaign associated with the widget 122.  The widgets 122B and 122C may then be associated with the sub-campaign, as well as the campaign.  Consequently, the viewers of the
widgets 122B and 122C might make donations using the widgets 122B and 122C, respectively.
<br/><br/> Field 186 may be similar to field 182.  Tracking of sub-campaigns or other attributes related to widgets that are copies of an ancestor widget may be provided in field 186.  For example, the field 186 may be used to track the progress of a
sub-campaign in the context of a larger fundraising campaign tracked in the field 182.  For example, status bars, thermometers, or other mechanisms that track attributes of the copy may be provided in field 186.  Note that if the widget 180 is a copy of
another widget, the tracking provided in field 186 may be for attributes selected by the owner of the widget 180.  The field 182 may then display tracking of attributes of an ancestor widget.  Conversely, if the widget 180 is an ancestor of another
widget, the field 182 may provide tracking for attributes originally selected by the owner of the widget 180.  The field 186 may then be provided at a later date if the owner of the widget 180 desires to track attributes of a copy.
<br/><br/> Comments may be made and/or displayed in the comments field 184 and/or in the rich media field 198.  Comments may be in textual or rich media format including video and audio.  The widget 180 may also include rich media customized by the widget
owner or other content provider in field 198.  For example, a widget owner can choose to include images as well as audio and/or video messages to encourage users to make a donation, perform some other action, or simply share content.  Content providers
might also be allowed add their own content to the widget on their site and copies thereof.  For example, the widget owner for site 130D may be allowed to add their own rich media content to the widget 132D in the field 198.  The provider 101 renders
such rich media when the site hosting 130D the widget 132D is accessed by a user.  In one embodiment, the rich media discussions/comments in fields 184 and 198 may be published in real time throughout all widgets that are related to a particular widget
regardless of from where the widget is being hosted.  Thus, threaded text and rich media discussions/comments may be provided via the widgets 180 themselves.  In addition, comments provided via one of the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C,
132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D may be disseminated by the provider 101 to all or a subset of the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D upon a refresh request
and/or periodically based upon organizer and/or provider set preferences.
<br/><br/> The buttons 188, 192, and 194 may have various uses.  Although only three buttons 188, 192 and 194 are shown, fewer or more buttons may be provided.  In one embodiment, the button 194 is a status button.  The status button 194 provides a
mechanism for viewing further details relating to the event or other externality associated with the widget 180 and/or owner of the widget 180.
<br/><br/> The button 192 may be a payment button.  The payment button 192 may allow users to make payments through the widget 180 without leaving the site hosting the widget 180.  Such a payment might, for example, be for electronic commerce or
fundraising.  In one embodiment, selection of a payment button 192 by a user results in the corresponding organizer-configured payment page 110 being accessed.  The user may then make a payment that is managed by the tracking and payment subsystem 104. 
The payment features that may correspond to the payment button 192 may include allowed forms of payment, event tracking, rules for extracting funds, the look and feel of the payment page 110, and other data relating to payment.  The payment button 192
may also refer the user to another site (not shown) through which payment may be made.  Such a site might, but need not, be associated with the provider 101.
<br/><br/> In addition, the widget 180 may be authenticated, which facilitates payment through the widget 180.  For example, the button 188 may be an authentication button.  A user may click on the authentication button 188.  The widget 180 may then make a
call back to one or more authentication services.  The authentication received is passed back to the widget 180.  Alternatively, a widget 180 may automatically and/or periodically request authentication and present this to the user in the field 188. 
This communication with authentication services may be performed via the provider 101 and/or through a third party.  The authentication allows a user to have a greater level of assurance that payment through the widget 180 is secure.
<br/><br/> Authentication of the widget 180 may be extended to other embeddable applications, such as Flash applications.  The authentication process may also use an embedded, dynamically generated by a third party, site seal (not shown) on the widget 180. This embeddable seal may be provided in the form of a code snippet (not shown) by a third party authentication firm to be embedded in the organization's widget.  Before a widget owner embeds the code snippet, they complete a validation process with the
third party.  Once authorized, embedded, and published live on the Internet, the user of the widget 180 sees a dynamically generated seal directly within the widget 180 that may also include dynamically generated code specific to that widget 180 from the
third party authentication firm.  Such a seal may be provided in the field 188.  When a user clicks on the seal, they are taken to the trusted third party's site to authenticate that the widget 180 is registered with the third party and to view any
security levels, if present, that protects the user of widget 180.  Upon arriving at the third party site for validation, the user may enter a code that is present on the seal.  If the code entered matches what the third party expects for that seal, the
profile of the company and other attributes are shared with the user.  The third party may also use URL information to ensure, if desired, that a widget 180 is being hosted on a Web page or other Internet host medium, if URL information is required as
part of the authentication process.  This might include an additional check that the source code of the widget 180 remains with the trusted third party and/or has been checked by the third party and that the user is viewing an un-tampered version of a
widget 180 based on digital signature credentials embedded in the widget 180 by the third party firm.  The seal may also include dynamically generated content directly into the widget 180 that shows information including the current date and time to show
visitors authentication information without having the visitor click through that the widget.
<br/><br/> The widget 180 may also include a copying field 190.  As discussed above, the widget 180 may also be self replicating and may, therefore, be copied and placed in multiple sites by multiple content providers.  To facilitate this feature, the
copying field 190 may be provided.  The copying field 190 may allow copying of the widget 180 through the widget 180.  In one embodiment, the copying field 190 provides a link that displays the code for the widget 180 and allows a user to copy and paste
the code to another site.  Consequently, a separate field (not shown) or a link to a different site for replicating the widget need not be provided.  However, in an alternate embodiment, the link to a different site may be provided and used.  Moreover, a
content provider may be allowed to customize the widget 180 at least to a limited extent.  In one embodiment, this customization may be limited by the widget owner of the ancestor widget, as described below.  Thus, replications or copies of a widget 180
may not be identical to the widget 180.  For example, the code for the widget includes an identification of the event(s) with which the widget is associated and parameters related to the size, shape, and color of the widget.  The copier of the widget 180
may be allowed change and/or add to the event(s) with which the widget is associated and alter the parameters to change the size, shape, and/or color of the widget displayed on the content provider's site.  However, such changes may be limited or
excluded by the owner of the ancestor widget.
<br/><br/> Although copying may be performed through the field 190, in one embodiment, the original code for the widget 180 resides with the provider.  Consequently, upgrades, changes to the widget configuration made by the widget owner, and other content
may be pushed from the provider 101 to the widget 180.  Such changes may also be pushed to some or all of the widget 180 copies.  Embedded in the copied code may be a reference to the ancestor widget as well as a new identification to identify the copied
widget.  In addition to copying, an email may be requested so that the user copying the widget may request set up of an account identifying that user as the copier of that widget 180 and thus retaining any tracking, benefits, or rewards as a result of
traffic generated from the copied widget.
<br/><br/> In addition to being copied through the copying field 190, in some embodiments, the widget may be copied to other sites through the proxy server 106.  In particular, the widget owner, the provider 101, or another content provider may wish to
replicate the widget on other site(s) not directly associated with the provider 101.  In order to do so, the proxy server 106 may provide an indirect connection to the other site(s), credential the site(s), and replicate the widget 180 to the site(s). 
Furthermore, the proxy server 106 may allow content, such as rich media audio or video, from site(s) not directly associated with the provider to be played on the widget 180.  In addition, widgets may communicate directly through the proxy server, for
example to disseminate comments, donation amounts, and/or other information.
<br/><br/> Use of the system 100 and widget 180 may facilitate electronic transactions.  Because the widget may be copied and further customized, sub-campaigns or other subsets of content of interest to copier(s) of an ancestor widget may be formed and
tracked through the widget 180.  For example, a content provider may copy a widget 180 to his or her own site.  Thus, widgets such as the widget 122A on the site 120A may be provided from another widget 122 on another site 120.  The widget owner of the
copy (copy owner) may then be allowed to add a sub-campaign or other features to the copy.  In a preferred embodiment, the copy owner registers with the ancestor widget owner (via the provider 101) in order to do so.  For the purposes of discussion, the
features that may be added or changed are described in the context of sub-campaigns.  However, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the modifications are not limited to sub-campaigns.  The copy owner may be allowed to specify the terms of
the sub-campaign within the context of the campaign, but generally would not be authorized to alter the specifications of the campaign.  The sub-campaign might be considered to be a group payment from contributors to the sub-campaign.  Such a
sub-campaign may be tracked, including using tracking mechanisms, such as the tracking and payment subsystem 104, in a manner analogous to the campaign.  For example, the widget owner of the ancestor widget may initiate a fundraising campaign for one
million dollars and provide a campaign thermometer in the field 182 of the corresponding widget 180.  A copy owner might initiate a sub-campaign for five hundred dollars.  This sub-campaign would be provided in field 186 on a copy of the widget 180,
further customized, and placed on the copy owner's or other site (e.g. their blog).  The copy of the widget 180 corresponding to the sub-campaign may provide event progress tracking in the form of a sub-campaign thermometer in the field 186.  The
sub-campaign might include any contributions made through the copy owner's widget and copies of the copy owner's widget.  A contributor may make a fifty dollar contribution to the sub-campaign.  The provider 101 may then update both the campaign
thermometer in field 182 and the sub-campaign thermometer in field 186.  Although the fifty dollar contribution would not significantly alter the campaign thermometer, such a contribution may be visible on the sub-campaign thermometer in the copy owner's
widget.  Thus, further contributions are facilitated.  Consequently, electronic financial transactions may be facilitated.
<br/><br/> Data related to contributions through the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D may also be tracked.  As discussed above, in one embodiment payments, for example for electronic
commerce or fundraising, may be made through any of the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D.  Various aspects of payments made and other features of the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A,
122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D may be tracked.  For example, the number and amount of payments made through a widget and/or its copies, the number of visits to the widget and/or its copies, the time the widget and/or
its copies have been available, the amount of time taken by the widget and/or its copies to receive donations, user comments, and other data related to the widget may also be tracked by the provider 101.  This tracking might be performed by the tracking
and payment subsystem 104 or another component (not shown).  As a result, the provider 101 may determine an effectiveness for various sites 120, 130, 140, 150, 120A, 120B, 120C, 130A, 130B, 130C, 130D, 130E, 140A, 140B, 140C, and 102D and/or widgets 122,
132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D.  In one embodiment, an effectiveness percentage is determined based upon the number of views of a widget 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C,
132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and/or 142D, the number of donors through the widget 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and/or 142D, the average contribution per donor, the aggregate donation through the
widget 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and/or 142D, and analogous data for copies of the widget 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and/or 142D. 
Based on this effectiveness percentage, organizers may determine the content providers that are desired for particular campaigns.
<br/><br/> Although the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D may be copied, pushed to other sites, sub-campaigns or other subsets of interest formed, customized, these and other
dissemination of the original widgets 122, 132, 142, and 152 may be moderated.  Moderation allows the widget owner to control the sites with which their widget, event, and the widget owner themselves are associated.  For example, the widget owner may
authorize only specific sites and/or sites fitting a particular profile to host the widget 122, 132, 142, and/or 152.  The provider 101 does not push the widget to sites not authorized by the organizer.  If an unauthorized content provider or other
unauthorized user copies the widget 122, 132, 142, and/or 152, then action may be taken based upon the widget owner's preferences.  For example, when the unauthorized copier's site is accessed, the provider 101 may send a message to the widget owner
requesting validation.  In some embodiments, the widget may not be rendered until the widget owner has expressly approved for the site.  Alternatively, the widget may be rendered unless and until the widget owner has expressly disapproved the site.
<br/><br/> The widgets 180 may also reflect local data.  The widget 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and/or 142D may be provided to multiple sites in a variety of ways, such as copies of widgets from the
widget owner's site 120, copies of widgets 132 from provider's site 130, and copies of widgets from other content provider's (copier's) sites.  In one embodiment, the widget 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B,
142C, and/or 142D may be configured to account for at least some of these local conditions.  For example, the field 182 may display the donations using the local currency and indicate relevant times using the local time.  In order to do so, the widget
180 may query the local computer system hosting the site to obtain local data, such as the time and/or language.  The widget 180 may then convert various components to reflect the local data.  For example, the language may be translated to the local
language and/or the time of relevant occurrences such as the event ending may be updated to reflect the local time.
<br/><br/> The widgets 180 may also be reusable.  The widget 180 may be copied and/or pushed to sites.  Once a widget 180 resides on a site, it may remain on the site unless and until expressly removed by the site owner or the provider 101.  Furthermore,
data may be pushed to widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D by the provider 101.  A widget 180 may be generally associated with particular event(s) that have specific closing dates, such as
a fundraising campaign, a wedding, a birthday, an ad campaign, or other event.  Once the event closes or for some other reason the widget 180 is no longer associated with the event, the widget 180 may be available for reuse.  The widget 180 may be reused
by the provider 101 pushing data to the widget 180 and/or by the owner of the widget 180 re-customizing the widget 180 for new events.  For example, when configuring the widget 180, a widget owner may indicate that once an event has closed, specific
content is to be pushed to the associated widgets.  This content could be a thank you message, an indication of other events that may be of interest to the content provider, or settings that reconfigure the widget 180 for another event.  Similarly, a
widget owner might reconfigure the widget 180 to be associated with another event or indicate to the provider 101 that the widget 180 may be reused for other events meeting certain criteria.  In one embodiment, these types of reuse may be possible for
both the ancestor widget and its copies.  The provider 101 may push new settings and parameters to the widgets 122, 132, 142, 152, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142A, 142B, 142C, and 142D residing on other sites based on widget owners'
specifications.  A widget owner might specify that the widget 180 on its site is available for causes fitting particular profiles.  For example, the owner of the widget 142D may specify that only certain ad campaigns or other data may be pushed to its
widget.  In one embodiment, these specifications must also fit within specifications provided by owners of the ancestor widgets 142 and 142A.  The provider 101 may then push data to the widget 142D on the site 140D to reuse the widget 142D for events or
other data fitting the profiles.  The owner of the site 140D and/or widget 142D may be paid or otherwise rewarded for use and/or reuse of the widget 142D on the site 140.
<br/><br/> The widget 180 may also "mature" and increase in value to both the widget owner and his/her audience.  For example, assume that the widget 180 is a copy (e.g. widget 122A, 122B, or 122C) of another widget (e.g. 122), associated with a particular
entity such as a business, and/or provides content from another entity.  In such an embodiment, the system 100 may be used in affiliate marketing.  The widget 180 may be used in affiliate marketing to dynamically display form, content, and functionality
based on the cumulative actions taken by previous visitors during the life of the campaign, as well as on actions taken by the current visitor, and based on the rules, logic, and settings defined by the promoter, the organizer, and, optionally, the
provider 101.  Thus, for each action taken, the widget 180 may be dynamically modified if either the promoter (widget owner) or organizer (entity associated with the marketing campaign) set up a rule to modify the widget.  For example, a visitor clicks
through and makes a contribution to a non-profit.  The widget 180 might be updated by a setting such as: adding the visitor's contribution amount to a campaign goal both visually in a graph and textually the number of contributors can be increased by one
or posting the name or initials of the latest contributor on the widget.  Such changes may be displayed in the field 182, 184, and/or 198.  If a visitor contributes the final incremental amount needed to meet a campaign goal, the widget 180 might be
updated to show a success image, to not accept any more click through for donations, to provide a special thank you message can appear, and/or have the widget's the look and feel changed.  Other examples may be found in voter registration, mailing lists,
or purchasing.  A visitor may click through and complete a form such as an online voter registration form.  In response, the widget 180 may be changed to show that one more person has taken the requested action.  A visitor who clicks through and signs up
for a mailing list may be the one thousandth person to do so from this widget 180.  The widget 180 may be changed to now add a video/audio file that only shows up on widgets 180 that drive at least one thousand signups.  A visitor clicks who through and
makes a purchase may be the one hundredth purchaser through this widget 180.  The widget 180 may now show a twenty percent discount message and content.  Moreover, all future purchasers may receive the same discount.  The types of actions, content
changes, form changes, link changes, and element changes are not limited to the examples above.  Rather the promoter and the organizer have free control over the rules to apply to actions taken by visitors.  These rules, settings, and content may be
configured and controlled via a Control Panel, such as the widget panel 112 discussed above.
<br/><br/> Similarly, as the number of actions recorded from the widget 180 increases, the widget 180 may take on increased functionality and/or allow for a higher level of reward and/or recognition from the owner of the ancestor widget or other entity to
which data on the widget corresponds.  The audience for the widget 180 may share in the value by either having a better experience (due to the increased features/functions on the widget 180) or share in promotions/discounts passed on by the owner of the
ancestor widget or other entity to which data on the widget corresponds.  The increase in value (through functionality or other features) of the widget 180, as well as the event(s) and/or actions triggering an increase in maturity may be controlled all
or in part by the owner of the ancestor widget or other entity to which data on the widget corresponds.  These actions may also provide unprecedented data mining to the owner of the ancestor widget or other entity to which data on the widget corresponds. These entities may wish to track how social networks interact with content and actions.  For example, in affiliate marketing applications, the method and system may provide significant advantages including but not limited to increased value to not only
the organizer, but also the promoter and the promoter's audience.
<br/><br/> Thus, using the system 100 and the widget 180, electronic transactions may be facilitated.  Such transactions may include financial transactions and social transaction.  Benefits may be provided to the widget owner, the owner(s) of copies of the
widget and other providers, as well as users/viewers of the widget.
<br/><br/> A natural application for the system 100 is in financial transactions.  For example, the system 100 may be used in various events, such campaigns.  A campaign may include a fundraising campaign, an advertising campaign, a sale of particular
goods and/or services, or other commercial activities.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 depicts an exemplary embodiment of a method 200 for providing a widget in the context of a financial transaction.  The widget dynamically displays multimedia content and may be used in performing the financial transactions, particularly
fundraising.  The widget may also be embeddable, portable and copyable.  The method 200 allows a widget to be configured.  For simplicity, the method 200 is described in the context of the widget 122 depicted in FIG. 1 as well as the widget 180 depicted
in FIG. 2.  However, the method 200 also applies to the remaining widgets 122A, 122B, 122C, 132, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142, 142A, 142B, 142C, 142D, and 152.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 1-3 the configuration of the widget 122 is received, via step 202.  In one embodiment, at least a portion of step 202 is performed when the owner configures the widget using the widget maker 102.  In such an embodiment, step
202 may include the widget maker 102 receiving information regarding the widget 122 from the owner of the widget 122.  In one embodiment, this information may be received through the widget panel 112 provided by the widget maker 102.  For example, the
widget panel 112 may provide the widget owner with options for the widget 122.  The widget owner may then select various fields 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, and 198 for inclusion in the widget 122, the color of the fields, and other available
options.  In another embodiment, the owner may simply enter data relating to the configuration of the widget 122.  Alternatively, some combination of selectable fields and owner-entered data may be employed.  In another embodiment, receipt of the
configuration in step 202 could include accessing data for the widget 122, for example in the database 108.  If the widget is a copy, such as the widget 122A or 122B, then at least a portion of the configuration information may be received from the
ancestor widget, such as the widget 122.  In addition, the owner of the copy may be allowed to modify the widget.  Such modifications would be received in step 202.
<br/><br/> When the configuration is provided in step 202, the widget 122 is associated with one or more events.  In one embodiment, the events are associated with financial transactions.  For example, the events might include one or more of a fundraising
campaign, a political campaign, an advertising campaign, a sale, a purchase, and a credit transaction.  Step 202 also includes configuring updatable tracking mechanism(s) for the event(s) as part of the multimedia content dynamically displayed by the
widget 122.  For example, data sources for the fields 182 and/or 186 may be provided.  The tracking mechanisms indicate the status of various characteristics of the event.  In one embodiment, step 202 also includes selecting the type of tracking
mechanism(s) included.  In one embodiment, the tracking mechanisms might include one or more of a thermometer, a status bar and a count-down clock.  For example, the widget 122 may be configured such that it is associated with a fundraising campaign (the
event) and displays a thermometer (tracking mechanism) indicating how high the funds raised are and a count-down clock (tracking mechanism) indicating how much time is left before the fundraising campaign ends.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the configuration received in step 202 may include other data.  The other fields 184, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, and 198 may also be configured.  For example, the configuration for a payment mechanism, such as the pay button 192
may be provided.  In addition, the configuration information may include a link to a page such as the payment page 110.  The configuration information might also include information used in authenticating the widget 122 and/or particular transaction, for
example via field 188.  Thus, the widget 122 itself, the payment page 110, or other items used in payment transaction may be authenticated.  In one embodiment, additional event and tracking mechanism might also be configured.  For example, a sub-campaign
and a tracking mechanism that might be displayed in field 186 might be configured.  Such a configuration might be provided if, for example, the widget 122 is a copy of another widget.  This would allow tracking and display of both the campaign and the
sub-campaign.  In addition, parameters related to controlling copying of the widget 122 and rules that allow the widget 122 to be subject to conditional logic may also be provided in step 202.  For example, if the widget owner may desire to ensure that
the widget 122 can only be copied to sites that meet certain criteria.  Such criteria might include a particular profile for the owner and/or typical users of the site.  The widget owner may then set up rules for moderation.  Such rules might include
only allowing the widget 122A, 122B, and/or 122C to be displayed if the sites 120A, 120B, and/or 120C meet the criteria or disabling the widget 122A, 122B, and/or 122C if the owner of the widget 122 determines that the sites 120A, 120B, and/or 120C are
not authorized.  Information related to the widget owner may also be received in step 202.  For example, the identity of the owner and/or a profile indicating causes with which the owner is sympathetic may be provided.  In one embodiment, the event(s)
received as part of the configuration may also be considered to widget owner information.
<br/><br/> Configuration of the widget 120 in step 202 may also be part of a process in which the widget owner exchanges other information with the provider 101.  For example, the owner of the widget 120 may set up an account with the provider 101.  If the
widget owner is a charity, the account may allow the charity to run multiple fundraising campaigns using the provider 101.  Thus, the account might allow the widget owner to configure multiple widgets for different events and/or a single widget 120 for
multiple events.  The widget owner may, therefore, also provide information related to these events.  The widget owner might also provide banking and/or credit information for accepting payments, making payments to the provider for the widget 120, and/or
obtaining funds paid by viewers of the widget 120.  The owner may also set up a mechanism for communication with the provider 101, for example via email.  The provider 101 may also validate the information provided by the widget owner.  Thus, the
provider 101 may ensure that the owner of the widget 101 pays the provider 101 for services rendered in connection with the widget 120.
<br/><br/> The widget 122 is rendered on the corresponding site(s) such as the site 120, via step 204.  The site(s) 120 on which the widget 122 is rendered may not be limited to web pages.  For example, the site 120 might include at least one of a web
page, a desktop computer system, a personal digital assistant, a mobile phone, and a laptop computer system.  The rendering in step 204 may include initially rendering the widget 122 as well as updating the widget 122.  In one embodiment, step 204 may
include obtaining any code for the widget 122 as well as any additional data, such as information associated with the event(s) and the tracking mechanism(s), from the database 108.  For example, a browser, host application or other mechanism used to view
the site 120 may request the widget 122.  The identification and code for the widget 212, as well as the appropriate information related to the event and tracking mechanisms, may be provided to the site 120.  This data may be provided to the site 120 in
a variety or ways, such as via the Internet, email, and/or a mobile phone application.  In one embodiment, the code is provided from another site and/or may employ authentication and/or moderation to ensure that the desired code is provided to a desired
site.  The widget 122 requests multimedia and other content from the provider 101 or other source once the widget 122 resides on the site 120.  The widget 122 and its content may then be displayed on the site 120.  Step 204 may also include updating the
widget 122.  In one embodiment, the widget 122 may periodically request updates.  In another embodiment, updates may be pushed to the widget 122.  The data may be pushed in response to some action that results in a change related to the event
information.  For example, an updated tracking mechanism, such as a thermometer, might be pushed to the widget 122 in response to additional contributions that might increase the level of the thermometer.  Similarly, if the event, such as a fundraiser,
auction, or other sale closes, an indication that the event is closed might be pushed to the widget 122 as part of rendering the widget 122.  In another embodiment, the updates may be provided by some combination of widget 122 requests and pushed data.
<br/><br/> Thus, using the method 200 the widget 122, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142, 142A, 142B, 142C, 142D, and 152 may be provided and disseminated throughout the system 100 and beyond.  Once rendered, the widgets 122, 122A,
122B, 122C, 132, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142, 142A, 142B, 142C, 142D, and 152 are available for use in financial and other transactions related to the corresponding events.  For example, a widget 122, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D,
132E, 142, 142A, 142B, 142C, 142D, and 152 may be used to donate funds or make purchases through the payment field 192 and/or payment page 110, authorized users may be allowed to set up sub-campaigns to encourage donations or other transactions, rich
media and other multimedia content may also be provided on the widget 122, 122A, 122B, 122C, 132, 132A, 132B, 132C, 132D, 132E, 142, 142A, 142B, 142C, 142D, and 152 to improve the users' experience and encourage donations.  In addition, the progress of
the event and sub-event may be tracked.  The tracking mechanisms in fields 182 and 186 may be dynamically and automatically updated to provide the user with ongoing feedback regarding the event.  For example, the user may be able to see in real time how
donations are approaching and/or exceeding goals for the campaign and/or sub-campaign.  For example, the donations to a sub-campaign of a fundraising campaign may be tracked.  Because the goal of the sub-campaign is generally less than the goal for the
campaign itself, the tracking mechanism for the sub-campaign may be updated more frequently and/or may have a larger visual change for each donation.  Thus, interest in the event and donations to the sub-campaign and the campaign itself may be
encouraged.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 depicts an exemplary embodiment of a system 220 for providing a widget.  The system 220 is analogous to portions of the system 100.  The system 220 thus includes a widget maker 222 that may be analogous to the widget maker 102, a database
224 analogous to the database 108, a widget editor 226 that may be analogous to a portion of the widget maker 102, a server 228 analogous to a portion of the provider 101, and site 230.  For clarity, only the sites 230 and widget 232 are described. 
However, in another embodiment, additional sites and/or widgets may be used.  Further, the site 230 may be considered to correspond to one or more of the sites 120, 130, 140, 150, 12A, 120B, 120C, 130A, 130B, 130C, 130D, 130E, 140, 140B, 140C, and 140D. 
Although shown separately, the widget maker 222 and widget editor 226 may be implemented using the server 228.  Thus, portions of the system 220, such as the widget maker 222, database 224, widget editor 226, and server 228 may correspond to the provider
101.
<br/><br/> The widget maker 222 is used by the owner of the widget 232 to configure the widget 232.  Because the widget 232 is initially generated using the widget maker 222, the widget 232A is shown on the widget maker 222.  When configuring the widget
232, the widget owner uses the widget maker 222 to make selections for the widget 232.  For example, the widget owner may choose the color, event or other externality associated with the widget 232, content presented, other selections that determine the
look and feel of the widget 232, as well as the modifiability of copies of the widget 232.  Thus, the widget maker 222 operates in an analogous manner to the widget maker 102.  In addition, the owner of the widget 232 may make selections relating to the
event with which the widget 232 is associated, the tracking mechanisms used, the fields 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, and 198 and other features of the widget 232.  In one embodiment, the widget maker 222 may provide the owner with selections
for available conditions and/or actions.  In another embodiment, the owner may enter desired conditions and/or actions.  In another embodiment, a combination of available selections and fields available for the owner to enter data may be used.  Thus, the
widget maker 222 is used to configure the widget 232A and corresponding event.
<br/><br/> The database 224 stores data 240 related to the widget 232.  The data 240 may include, among other information, the code corresponding to the widget 232 and information related to the widget owner of the widget 232.  Thus, the data 240 includes
any rules, conditions, actions, and/or parameters to which the widget 232 is subject.  In addition, the data 240 might be later modified using the widget maker 222 or the widget editor 226.  The widget editor 226 may be hosted by the provider or another
entity.  For example, a widget editor 226 hosted by another entity (not shown) may be used to modify a copy of the widget 232 and post the copy to another site (not shown) associated with the entity.
<br/><br/> The widget 232 is published on the owner's site 230 using the server 228.  Thus, the code for the widget 232 is accessed from the database 224 and placed on the site 230.  In order to provide the widget 232 on the site 230, a widget player (not
separately shown) that shares code in common with the widget maker 222 may be used.  Such a widget player executes the embeddable code for the widget 232.  Consequently, the widget player and widget 232 may be used synonymously herein.  When published on
the site 230, the widget 232 may access the data 240, for example through the server 228.  In addition, the server 228 may be used to track data such relating to the widget 232.  For example, progress of the event, changes to the widget 232 that may be
provided to the widget 232 and its copies (not shown), actions of viewers of the widget 232, other characteristics of the widget, as well as other data may be tracked by the server 228.  Such data may be stored on the database 224 and provided to the
widget 232, for example in the form of a status bar or thermometer used as a tracking mechanism.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 depicts an exemplary embodiment of a method 250 for providing a widget.  The method 250 is described in the context of the system 220.  However, the method 250 may be used in another system (not shown) having different and/or additional
components.  For example, the method 250 may be used in connection with the system 100.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 4-5, the owner of the widget 232 customizes the widget 232, via step 252.  Step 252 is analogous to step 202 of the method 200.  Consequently, the owner provides the event(s) with which the widget 232 is associated, the
tracking mechanism(s), as well as other features of the widget 232.  In one embodiment, the owner uses the widget maker 222 to perform step 252 if the widget 232 is not a copy of another widget.  If the widget 232 is a copy, then the user may perform
step 252 using the widget editor 226.  In such a case, the owner may modify the copy in step 252.  For example, the owner might at a sub-campaign and configure a field (not shown) for displaying a tracking mechanism (not shown) for the sub-campaign. 
However, the owner may be constrained in the modifications made based on the preferences of the owner of the ancestor widget (not shown).  In addition, the owner of the widget 232 may provide other information as part of the customization process.  For
example, the owner may set up an account with the provider.  Such an account might allow the widget owner to configure multiple widgets and different events.  The widget owner also provides information related to various events associated with the
account and/or the widget 232.  The widget owner might also provide banking and/or credit information for accepting payments, making payments to the provider for the widget 232, and/or obtaining funds paid by viewers of the widget 232.  The owner may
also set up a mechanism for communication with the provider, for example via email.  The provider may also validate the information provided by the widget owner.
<br/><br/> The widget maker 222 and/or widget editor 226 store the data 234 for the widget 232 in the database 224, via step 254.  Thus, the configuration of the widget 232 determined by the customization process of step 232 is stored.  Information related
to the event(s) associated with the widget 232, the tracking mechanism(s), the owner, any payment that may be made through the widget 232, as well as other data affecting the widget may be stored in step 254.  In one embodiment, the data 234 may be
updated, for example with the current status of the event(s) as well as with changes to the configuration of the widget.
<br/><br/> The widget owner may be allowed to modify the configuration of the widget 232, via step 256.  In one embodiment, step 256 may be performed through the widget editor 226.  However, in another embodiment, step 256 might be performed in another
fashion, for example through the widget maker 222.  Although depicted as after step 254 and before step 258, in one embodiment step 256 might be performed at any time.  For example, the widget owner might be allowed to modify the widget 232 at another
time, including but not limited to after publication of the widget in step 258.
<br/><br/> The widget 232 may be published to the widget owner's site 230, via step 258.  Step 258 may include providing the code for the widget 232 to the site 230.  In one embodiment, step 258 is carried out for a copy widget only if the owner of the
ancestor widget has expressly or implicitly approved the copy.  In one embodiment, step 258 includes the communications between a viewer's host application attempting to access the site 230 and the server 228.  In such an embodiment, step 258 includes
the host application, such as a browser, accessing the code for the site 230 that refers to the server 228.  The host application may then request the widget code from the server 228.  This request may provide information about the host application, such
as the IP address of site 230 on which the widget 232 is to reside and a widget identification (ID).  The server 228 stores the information provided in the request, for example in the database 224.  In response, the server 228 provides a session ID used
to track communications with the widget 232.  The server 228 may also determine whether the site 230 is authorized to host the widget 232.  This determination may be made if the widget 232 is a copy of an ancestor widget (not shown).  In addition, the
server 228 may provide the data 234 including the code for the widget 232.  Alternatively, the server 228 may provide another uniform resource identification (URI) for a location from which the widget 232 may be obtained as well as a secret token or
other code for identification purposes that may be decoded only by an authorized widget.  In one embodiment, this code may be dynamically generated and depend upon certain real time factors, may contain certain algorithms that are only known to hosts and
widget, may be generated by some process such that only an authorized widget can decode.  The code for the widget 232 may then be provided to the host application.  In one embodiment, this is performed by the host application making a request to the new
URI including the widget ID and the session ID.  The widget may then be sent to and loaded by the host application.  The widget 232 may then decode the token and provide a response to the server 228 with the request for its content.  This content may
also be termed a widget feed.  If the response is not appropriate for the token, the server 228 may refuse to provide the widget feed, disable the widget 232, or provide another response appropriate for an unauthorized widget.  Otherwise, the server 228
determines that the widget 232 is authorized and may provide the widget feed.  Additional features, such as the payment button 192 or certain video or audio, may also be unlocked.  Consequently, the widget 232 is rendered on the site 230.  In addition,
as discussed below in step 262, the widget may be updated through the widget feed.
<br/><br/> Donations and/or other financial transaction may be performed through the widget 232, via step 260.  Although shown as a separate step in line with the remainder of the method 250, donations may be performed in parallel with various portions of
the method 250.  Step 260 may include validating a user's credit information or performing some other authentication.  In one embodiment, the donation or financial transaction may be made through the site 230.  In another embodiment, step 260 may include
referring the user to another site (not shown) including payment page(s) or other mechanisms for performing financial transactions.  The financial transactions provided through step 260 may be through a site hosted by the same entity as the server 228 or
by a different entity.  Similarly, authentication of the widget 232 and/or user may be performed by a component of the system 220, such as the server 228, or another entity such as a third-party authentication service.
<br/><br/> Tracking is performed for the widget 232, via step 262.  Although shown as a separate step in line with the remainder of the method 250, tracking may be performed in parallel with various portions of the method 250.  Step 262 includes tracking
the donation and/or other financial transaction as well as other changes related to the widget 232.  Such tracking may be performed using the server 228.  Data obtained by the tracking may be stored in the database 224.  Thus, aggregate donations,
availability of goods for sale or as bonuses for donation, users' actions, users' identities, copies, sub-campaign information, as well as other data related to the widget 232 may be tracked in step 262.
<br/><br/> The widget 232 may be updated, via step 264.  In one embodiment, step 264 is performed as part of the widget feed obtained in step 258.  The widget 232 may be periodically updated, for example based on time elapsed and/or actions taken.  For
example, updates may be provided to the widget 232 based on donations made, the closing of a sub-event such as a sub-campaign, the closing of an event such as a fundraising campaign, or other occurrences.  In one embodiment, the updates are pushed to the
widget 232.  In another embodiment, the widget 232 may request the updates either periodically or in response to a user's action.  For example, a sub-campaign thermometer may be updated in response to a donation being made through a widget associated
with the sub-campaign.  The thermometer for the campaign may or may not be simultaneously updated, for example depending upon whether the donation was sufficient to sufficiently change the level of the thermometer as viewed on the widget 232.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 depicts an exemplary embodiment of a widget 232' usable in financial transactions.  The widget 232' may be one embodiment of the widget 232 provided and used in the method 250.  Thus, the widget 232' might be configured in step 252 and/or
256, published in step 258, and updated in step 264.  The widget 232' resides on a site (not explicitly indicated) and may be viewed using host application 300.  The fields 302, 304, 306, 308, 310, 312, 314, 316, 318, 320, 322, 324, 326, 328, 330, 332,
334, and 336 are examples of multimedia content related to the event that may be provided through the widget 232'.
<br/><br/> The widget 232' includes an event description 302 such as the title of a fundraising campaign.  Field 304 provides event details such as the start and end times of the event.  Multimedia from the event may be provided in field 306.  For example,
a feed of entertainment or other content might be provided in the field 306.  Graphical and textual views of the collection status for donations may be provided in fields 308, 312, and 316.  For example, a thermometer view of the status of
collections/donations may be provided in field 316, while a text summary of the collections/donations may be provided in field 312.  Thus, the fields 308, 312, and 316 may provide various tracking mechanisms for the event.  A link 310 to an external site
that includes details related to the event and/or organizer of the event (e.g. the owner of the widget 232') may also be provided.  A link 314 to join in the event may also be provided.  The link 314 may, for example, be used in a blograising campaign. 
Messages from the event may be provided in the field 318.  For example, donors wishing to add messages may use the field 318.  External links 320 may also be provided.  Such links 320 may allow the user/viewer of the widget 232' to access sites that are
related to the event, the organizer, and/or widget owner for the event.  Local data may be selected in fields 322 and 324.  For example, the user may select a particular language and currency using fields 322 and 324, respectively.  A link to
notification options might be provided in the widget 232'.  Thus, a user may opt to have email, telephonic or other notifications received.  For example, the user may obtain notifications when a particular goal has been reached or when the event closes
in a certain amount of time.  Advertising may be provided in field 328.  The advertising provided in field 328 might be dynamically provided.  The content shown in the advertising field 328 may change based upon a user's actions.  For example, new
content may be provided if a user makes a donation and may change based upon the amount or number of donations.  The participants in the event may be shown in field 330.  For example, the businesses hosting a charity event or individuals currently taking
part in a blograising campaign may be displayed.  In one embodiment, this display may be graphical, textual, or some combination thereof.  Statistics on the collections/donations may be shown in fields 332 and 334.  In addition to the fields 308, 312,
and 316 other tracking mechanism(s) such as count-down clocks may be provided in field 336.  The clocks may be for the event and/or for any sub-campaigns associated with the event.
<br/><br/> Using the method 250, the widget 232/232' may be provided.  Similarly, copies (not shown) may be configured and published to corresponding sites.  Visitors to the site 230 may view and use the widget 232/232'.  The widget 232/232' may thus be
