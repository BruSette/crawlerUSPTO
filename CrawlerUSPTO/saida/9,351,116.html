<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>FIELD OF INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention relations to a system and method for providing proximity information, and particularly, although not exclusively, to a system and method for providing proximity information to users in mobile geo-social networks.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
<br/><br/> Mobile social networks have been gaining increasingly popularity in the past couple of years.  A recent survey by UK's Office of Communications (Ofcom) shows high penetration ratios of mobile social network in various countries (see Table 1).  A
report from Morgan Stanley also shows that users have a growing tendency to access their social networks more often by smartphones than desktop computers or laptops (see FIG. 1).  Among all mobile social networking services, geo-social networking, which
enables mobile users to interact based on their locations at any time and any place, is among the most appealing ones.  For example, the Google Latitude service enables you to visualize the locations of nearby friends on a map and launch social
activities such as chatting or collaborative filtering.  As a typical example, you may ask your nearby friends "Where can I find good pizza around here?".  A variety of similar services have been populated in the market, by either social network giants
like <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> or specialized vendors like Foursquare, Gowalla, or Loopt.

<br/><br/> scanning the plurality of signatures associated with each of the plurality of objects in the multi-layered grid model to determine one or more changes with the one or more proximity relationships; and
<br/><br/> whereupon the scan detects one or more changes between the one or more proximity relationships between the one or more objects in the multi-layered grid model, updating the location data set by requesting for an updated signature from the one or
more objects detected to have one or more changes between the one or more proximity relationships of the one or more objects.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment of the first aspect, the multi-layered grid model includes a lowest level grid overlay being initially placed with objects having no proximity relationships and one or more grid layers above the lowest level grid overlay which
are each initially placed with objects having one or more proximity relationships.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment of the first aspect, a dimension of each cell of each grid overlay increases at each grid overlay layer from the lowest level grid overlay to a top level grid overlay.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment of the first aspect, the top level grid overlay includes a single cell dimensioned to cover the entire network space.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION
<br/><br/> Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors through trials, research, study and review of results and observations is of the opinion that while mobile geo-social networking holds a lot of promise for business and marketing, increasing
privacy concerns have been raised, which hinders its wider acceptance.
<br/><br/> In particular, currently all these services collect location information from mobile users (though users may opt not to disclose their locations to untrusted users or even the service provider when they do not need the service).  Although a
large body of recent research has been carried out on preserving location anonymity in accessing location-based services (LBS), they mainly focus on queries over public points of interests (such as gas stations, and hotels).  In these works, such as A.
Beresford and F. Stajano, "Location privacy in pervasive computing," IEEE Pervasive Computing, vol. 2, no. 1, pp.  46-55, 2003, G. Myles, A. Friday, and N. Davies, "Preserving privacy in environments with location-based applications," Pervasive
Computing, vol. 2, no. 1, pp.  56-64, 2003 and C.-Y. Chow, M. F. Mokbel, and W. G. Aref, "Casper*: Query processing for location services without compromising privacy," ACM Transactions on Database Systems, vol. 34, no. 4, 2009, only the location privacy
of the requesting user needs to be protected.  In contrast, the present invention addresses proximity detection, an arising category of mobile geo-social networking services.  In these services, users not only issue proximity queries but also serve as
the query results.  As a typical example, the mobile service "nearby friend alert" notifies a user when her friend (i.e., users in the same social group, such as family, classmates, colleagues) is in close proximity to her, that is, they are within a
(user-specified) distance away.  FIG. 2 demonstrates this service, where "proximity" is set as within 500 meters of Manhattan distance (the sum of distances in each dimension), and agreed on by all members in the group.  It is also noteworthy that this
service runs continuously--the alert messages go on or off the screens when two friends move towards or away from each other.
<br/><br/> This new service paradigm calls for privacy protection schemes on mutual parities--those querying and those being queried, and both are constantly moving.  In recent literature, there are a few works that tackle this problem under different
system models and proximity definitions.  In S. Mascetti, C. Bettini, D. Freni, X. S. Wang, and S. Jajodia, "Privacy-aware proximity based services," in Proc.  of MDM, 2009, pp.  31-40, Mascetti et al. assumed a trusted service provider (SP) and proposed
a solution called "Hide&amp;Crypt".  In essence, it is a filter-and-refine two-phase procedure.  In the first phase, to protect location privacy, all users cloak their locations into a set of granules (i.e., grid cells) and send them to the SP, who then
filters out those pairs that are confirmed as non-result pairs.  In the second phase, the SP notifies users of uncertain pairs to refine the proximity result.  Specifically, each pair of users employ the finer granularity of both users, and then start a
secure two-party set-inclusion protocol on the resulted sets of granules to detect whether any other user is in proximity.  In S. Mascetti, D. Freni, C. Bettini, X. Wang, and S. Jajodia, "Privacy in geo-social networks: proximity notification with
untrusted service providers and curious buddies," VLDB Journal, pp.  541-566, 2011, they further relaxed the requirement of a trusted SP and proposed two solutions for the same proximity detection problem.  The first one, "Hide&amp;Seek", treats the SP as an
untrusted hub where users store their encrypted granules for the querying user to retrieve and detect proximity.  Specifically, the querying user retrieves the encrypted granules, decrypts them, and computes his minimum distance to these granules to
detect proximity.  As such, in Hide&amp;Seek the querying user knows the exact granule of the other users.  The second solution, "Hide&amp;Hash", further protects this exact granule from the querying user by hashing it instead of encryption.  Then as in
Hide&amp;Crypt, the querying user starts a secure set-inclusion protocol with the SP to detect whether any other user is in proximity.
<br/><br/> Assuming a non-trusted SP, Siksnys et al proposed the FriendLocator system in L. Siksnys, J. R. Thomsen, S. Saltenis, M. L. Yiu, and O. Andersen, "A location privacy aware friend locator," in Proc.  Of SSTD, 2009, pp.  405-410., which is the
first work that applies the "grid-and-hashing" techniques.  The major difference from Hide&amp;Hash is that FriendLocator employs a global (instead of user-specific) grid partitioning, which helps to eliminate the two-party protocol.  Further, a multi-level
granule system is designed to reduce location updates when users are far away from their friends.  In L. Siksnys, J. R. Thomsen, S. Saltenis, and M. L. Yiu, "Private and flexible proximity detection in mobile social networks," in Proc.  Of 11.sup.th
International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM), Kansas City, Mo., 2010, they further proposed VicinityLocator, which differs from all the above systems by enabling user-defined proximity criterion.  Specifically, it allows the user to specify
her area of interest as the "vicinity region"; a friend is in proximity only if the friend is located in this region.  However, due to the complexity and high cost of the detection process, these works tend to adapt the original definition of proximity
to align with the grid settings.  In all "Hide&amp;-" approaches, the minimum possible distance between two users is used for proximity detection.  As such, if two users are in the same granule, they are considered in-proximity because their minimum possible
distance is 0.  Similarly in FriendLocator and VicinityLocator, the authors allow proximity to be defined fuzzily in uncertain cases.  In FriendLocator, there are essentially two distance thresholds d and d+.lamda.--users are strictly in-proximity within
d and strictly not in-proximity beyond d+.lamda.; but the relation for distances between these two values is decided arbitrarily; or quoted from the authors, "on a proximity notification, the actual distance between the two users can be in the range from
d to d+.lamda.", where .lamda.=d(2 {square root over (2)}-1) is a non-user-configurable system constant.  Likewise, in VicinityLocator, if the minimum distance between the user's location and the vicinity region is shorter than .lamda.  (but larger than
0), the proximity relation will be decided arbitrarily.
<br/><br/> While the aforementioned works pioneer in the field of proximity detection, there is still lack of support on true proximity or a quantitative study of the detection accuracy with true proximity.  In the present invention, based on the similar
granule and hashing techniques as in previous works, there is proposed an example of a proximity detection scheme for the "nearby friend alert" service that can address the service inaccuracy (i.e., false-positive and false-negative detection) in a
quantitative manner.  In particular, one embodiment of the present invention may eliminate false-positive cases by setting an appropriate grid size.
<br/><br/> To minimize false-negative detection, one possible method is to propose a grid overlay or referred to as a multiple layer grid model, which is a set of independent grids, and study the optimal placement of these grids.  The key advantage of the
present invention over existing works is that users can dynamically trade accuracy for communication cost (or vice versa) in a quantitative manner, by adding (or removing) a number of grids.  This advantage is particularly critical in mobile environments
where bandwidth and battery conditions may change drastically.  To enhance the realtime performance of the present invention for large-scale systems, in some examples, it was also developed the multi-level grid scheme that can significantly reduce the
user location update frequency and thus the server load.  Based on this design, client-side location updates and the server-side update handling procedures are devised.
<br/><br/> Citation or identification of any reference in this section or any other section of this application shall not be construed as an admission that such reference is available as prior art for the present application.
<br/><br/> The present invention is not to be limited in scope by any of the specific embodiments described herein.  The following embodiments are presented for exemplification only.
<br/><br/> In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a system for providing proximity information comprising a processor for processing a location data set having locations of a plurality of objects in a network space by
applying a grid and hashing paradigm to the locations of the plurality of objects so as to generate a proximity set arranged to represent one or more proximity relationships between the one or more objects in the network.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the present invention, the user mobility is firstly ignored and proceed to analyze how the SP can detect two stationary users or objects u and v are in proximity.  In this process, the coordinates of user u should not be
disclosed to user v or the SP; further, "u is in proximity" is the only information known by v and the SP.  For ease of presentation, in one example, it is assumed that all parties (the SP and mobile users) are non-colluding and follow a semi-honest
model.  In a semi-honest model, all parties follow the designated protocol properly except that they may record intermediate results and try to deduce about the location information of other users.
<br/><br/> In this embodiment, it is assumed to use the Manhattan distance as a unit and .delta.  denote the distance threshold for proximity.  Throughout this description of the present invention, the Manhattan distance is used because it is a popular
distance metric and more favorable than the Euclidean distance in urban area where this service is needed most.  Let (u.sub.x, u.sub.y) denote u's coordinates, then the distance between u and v are defined as Dist((u.sub.x, u.sub.y), (v.sub.x,
v.sub.y))=|u.sub.x-v.sub.x|+|u.sub.y-v.sub.y|.  The binary relation "in_proximity" of two users u, v, is true if and only if they are within .delta.  meters away.  Formally, in_proximity(u, v):=Dist((u.sub.x, u.sub.y), (v.sub.x, v.sub.y)).ltoreq..delta..
<br/><br/> The concept of proximity detection without disclosing user locations is to apply a space transformation that preserves proximity, and the SP then detects proximity in the transformed space.  This may also be referred to as applying the location
data which may comprises of a list of user locations to a grid-hash paradigm arranged to generate a list of proximity relationships between each of the users, or indeed any objects.  Preferably, the transformation is one-way so that the SP cannot infer
the original user locations.  In the one example embodiment, the "grid-and-hashing" transformation as in Mascetti et al. and Siksnys et al. This transformation or grid hash paradigm may impose a uniform grid G that represents a network of partitioned
cells and together models a network space such as a geographical environment covered by a communication network or cellular mobile phone network.  Note that in this example embodiment, the placement of G is a secret that is shared by users in the same
group and unknown to the SP.
<br/><br/> In this example embodiment, for each user u of (u.sub.x, u.sub.y), her cell is indexed by (G.sup.x(u.sub.x), G.sup.y(u.sub.y)).  The user then encodes this index by a one-way hashing function .GAMMA.  and sends the hash value
.GAMMA.((G.sup.x(u.sub.x), G.sup.y(u.sub.y))) to the SP.  This may be referred to as the hash value the signature of u with regard to grid G, denoted by G(u).  To detect proximity of two users, the SP simply tests the equality of their uploaded
signatures.  To prevent reverse engineering of the cell and false positive results, .GAMMA.  should be implemented by a keyed cryptographic (i.e., collision free) hash function, for example, SHA-256.  The key is distributed among users in the same group
and dynamically changing (e.g., by rehashing) against SP's inference.
<br/><br/> In some instances, an arbitrary grid G may not necessarily preserve the proximity relation accordingly the choice of the cell size is critical.  On the one hand, if the cell's half diagonal length lc&gt;.delta./2, the maximum Manhattan distance
between two points in the same cell exceeds .delta., which creates "false-positive" cases--that is, two users are detected as in_proximity while they are not.  On the other hand, even if lc is arbitrarily small, two in_proximity users might still be
separated in adjacent cells and thus have different signatures.  These are the "false-negative" cases.  For example, in FIG. 3(a), u and v are within .delta.  meters away, but they are not in the same cell.  In fact, to be in_proximity with u, v can be
any point in the shaded region, and hereafter called the proximity region of u. The region is a square centered at u with its half diagonal length equal to .delta..
<br/><br/> One manner in which it is possible to study how frequently the false-negative cases occur, it is possible to proceed to derive P(FN|in_proximity) and P(TP|in_proximity), the conditional probabilities of false-negative and true-positive
detection, given the actual relation is "in_proximity".  Assuming users are distributed uniformly in the network space.  The latter probability equals to the proportion of one cell to the whole proximity region (see FIG. 3(a)).  Formally,
<br/><br/> .function..times..function..times..times..times..delta.  ##EQU00001##
<br/><br/> From Eqn.  1, the larger the cell (i.e., l.sub.c increases), the fewer the false-negative cases.  However, as aforementioned, when l.sub.c&gt;.delta./2, increasing l.sub.c will lead to more false-positive cases.  Therefore, in one example, a
design decision is to set l.sub.c=.delta./2 to eliminate false-positives while keeping minimum number of false-negative cases.  Thus the cell size, or its dimensions can effectively be determined based on the desired accuracy in the form of a desired
accuracy variable which can be adjusted based on the minimum number of false-negatives which is deemed acceptable to the user, or that would be acceptable under the resource availability at a particular time.
<br/><br/> Grid Overlay
<br/><br/> From Eqn.  1, the false-negative probability by the standard "grid-and-hashing" approach is 75% as l.sub.c=.delta./2.  To further reduce it, a multi-layered grid model or referred to as a grid overlay scheme can be used.  In one example, by
imposing more than one grid partition G.sub.1, .  . . , G.sub.n, as shown in FIG. 3(b) to overlay each other, a multilayered grid model arranged to model the network space can be achieved.  For ease of presentation, it is possible by rotating the
coordinate system by 45.degree.  and thus all grid lines are either horizontal or vertical.  Each grid is created from the previous one by some shifting on both x-axis and y-axis, in the hope that a false-negative case in one grid (e.g., u and v in
G.sub.1) can be successfully detected in another grid (e.g., in G.sub.2).  As such, the proximity detection of u and v should test the equality of their signatures with regard to all grids, i.e., G.sub.1(u) with G.sub.1(v), G.sub.2(u) with G.sub.2(v), . 
. . , and G.sub.n(u) with G.sub.n(v).  u and v are in_proximity as long as one of these pairs is equal.  There are various examples as to the number of overlay grids n selected and how they are placed.
<br/><br/> In one example, a straightforward approach is to generate these grids by random shifting.  FIG. 4(a) illustrates user u (404) and its proximity region (the light grey area 406).  The solid boxes 408 are the cells that cover u in grids G.sub.1,
G.sub.2, .  . . , G.sub.n.  Note that their top left corners must reside in the top left quadrant (the dark grey area) of u's proximity region.  The probability of false-negatives P(FN|in_proximity) is the proportion of the proximity region that is not
covered by any of the n covering cells.  To calculate this area, firstly, it is possible to focus on the top left quadrant (the dark grey area) 410.
<br/><br/> At point v=(x, y), the probability of v not being covered is
<br/><br/> .times..times..delta.  ##EQU00002## Integrating both x and y and multiplying by four quadrants, it can be obtained the expected probability of false-negatives for n random-shifting grids.
<br/><br/> .function..times..times..times..times.  ##EQU00003##
<br/><br/> The second row of Table 2 shows this value as the number of grids n increases.  In some examples, it may not drop significantly even when n grows exponentially.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 P(FN|in_proximity) of Random and Optimal placement.  n 2 8 16 32 64 128 256 Random % 61.1 31.4 20.2 12.4 7.32 4.22 2.39 Optimal % 43.8 23.4 12.1 6.15 3.10 1.56 0.78
<br/><br/> To reduce this value, it is desirable to find the optimal placement of a new grid G' on top of n existing grids.  In one example, by starting with n=1.  FIG. 4(b) illustrates the placement of G' 402 and the existing G 401.  Since each dimension
is equal, it is assumed G' deviates t from G in each dimension.  Without loss of generality, is it also assumed u is in the upper right cell of G 412.  The area of true-positive cases for v is therefore the union of the two covering cells of u in G and
G'. Therefore, minimizing P(FN|in_proximity) is equivalent to minimizing their overlapping area.
<br/><br/> In this figure where ux&gt;t and uy&gt;t, the overlapping area is shown as the light grey area 414; if ux&lt;t and uy&lt;t (such as u'), this area is the dark grey area 416, and so on.  In any case, this area achieves the minimum when
t=.delta./4.  This same rationale applies to n&gt;2.  Suppose n=2k(k&gt;1).  The optimal grid overlay is created by shifting the first grid G in both diagonals for every 1/k of the cell length.  FIG. 4(c) shows the case of k=4.  Then the false-negative
probability is (Note: It is noteworthy that the two diagonals share one duplicate grid (e.g., G.sub.1 and G.sub.5); and if k is odd, they share one more duplicate grid in the midpoint (e.g., G.sub.3 and G.sub.7).  As such, the actual number of grids
needed is either n-1 or n-2.  For simplicity, it is possible to omit this saving of grids throughput herein.)
<br/><br/> .function..times..times.  ##EQU00004##
<br/><br/> In practice, the SP may have a service level agreement (SLA) with the subscribers in this nearby friend-alert service, which declares a threshold value .tau.  for the expected false-negative probability P(FN|in_proximity).  The number of grids
required may then be derived from Eqn.  3.  Table 2 shows the numerical values side by side with those of the random placement.  It is thus shown that the optimal placement achieves even lower false-negative probability with only half the number of
random grids.  In a similar manner as the cell dimension, thus the number of grids, in one example embodiment, may also be determined based on the desired level of service, such as the desired level of accuracy in the form of a desired level accuracy
variable as determined or selected by a user based on the resources which are available to the user and how much resource the user would like to use.  This in turn may be measured by a predetermined resource usage factor set by a user or SP.
<br/><br/> Dynamic Proximity Monitoring with Location Anonymity
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, it is possible to incorporate user mobility and study how the SP continuously monitors the in-proximity result: it alerts two users or objects when they are moving closer than the proximity threshold .delta., and cancels the
alert when they move apart.  The continuous monitoring involves user signature update and SP query re evaluation, both of which will be addressed in the following.  One example approach is that the user updates any signature of the grid overlay whenever
it has been changed.  Once the SP receives the updated signature, it will execute the proximity detection procedure as previously described.  That is, it performs signature equality test against existing signatures from other users in the same group.
<br/><br/> One difficulty with this approach is extremely costly as the overlay may contain dozens of grids and thus lead to frequent signature updates.  One key observation to reduce such updates is that, updates for non-proximity pairs can be less
frequent than updates for in-proximity pairs.  To capture this, there is illustrated an example of a multi-level grid overlay (or multilayer grid model) hierarchy as shown in FIG. 5.  The lowest level (level-0) grid overlay (500) is the original grid
overlay for the static case.
<br/><br/> Recall that the cell size (in terms of the half-diagonal length l.sub.c) of any grid in this overlay is .delta./2.  This level of grid overlay is used for in-proximity pairs, while all upper levels (502 and 504) are used for non-proximity pairs. In any upper level (level-1, level-2, .  . . ), the cell size is m times that of its immediate lower level (level-0, level-1, .  . . ), until in the uppermost level (level-L) a single cell covers the entire space.  The scaling factor m is a system
parameter that should be based on the mobility pattern of users.  In general, the more distance users may travel in a period of time, the larger m should be chosen.  In FIG. 5, m=3.  Note that for clarity, in FIG. 5 it is shown that only one grid is
plotted in every level.  As is discussed in a previous above, the number of grids needed in the level-0 grid overlay should be calculated from the false-negative probability threshold .tau..  The lower the .tau., more grids are needed.  Similarly, each
overlay in the upper levels should have sufficient number of grids to guard all non-proximity pairs with the same false-negative probability threshold .tau..  In the i-th level, the expected false negative probability can be generalized from Eqn.  3 as
follows.
<br/><br/> .function..times..times..times..times..times.  ##EQU00005##
<br/><br/> Signature Update
<br/><br/> Given this hierarchy, the signature update scheme for user u in one example embodiment is as follows.  If user v is already in proximity, then u and v must have a common signature set (CSS) at level-0 (500), denoted by CSS.sub.0(u, v).  As such,
u should update when any signature in CSS.sub.0(u, v) is changed.  (Note: Here it is required "any" not "all" because v could face the same update decision without knowing u's decision.) On the other hand, if v is not in_proximity, then u and v do not
have a CSS at level-0, level-1, .  . . , till in some level-i (i&gt;0), their CSS is no longer empty.  The level i-1 may be referred to as the "uppermost non-common level" (UNL) of u and v. For example, in FIG. 5, UNL(u, v)=1 (502) as they have a CSS in
level-2 (504).  Although any level below UNL also guarantees the non-proximity relation, UNL (502) is the highest such level and thus has the largest cell size to reduce signature update.  Therefore, user u only needs to store the whole signature set
(SS) in level UNL(u, v) and update when any such signature is changed.
<br/><br/> The whole update decision of user u should base on all v's in the same social group.  To summarize, u should update when there is any signature change in: (1) any in-proximity v's CSS0, or (2) any non-proximity v's SS.sub.UNL(u, v).  As such,
throughout the service running time, the user u needs to maintain either CSS.sub.0(u, v) or UNL(u, v) of all v's.  To reduce the set of signatures to be checked, for (2) one can use a unified UNL instead of treating each v independently.  UNL(u) is
defined as the lowest UNL(u, v) of all non-proximity v's.
<br/><br/> Query Re-Evaluation
<br/><br/> Upon receiving an update of signature(s), the SP attempts to reevaluate the in_proximity relation of u and every v in the same group.  If u and v were in_proximity, the SP checks if there is any update in CSS.sub.0(u, v).  If there is no such
update or the updated CSS.sub.0(u, v) is still non-empty, then u and v are still in-proximity.  Otherwise, they are no longer in_proximity.  To calculate UNL(u, v) for them, the SP probes v for her updated signatures in all levels.  UNL(u, v) is then
replied to both.  On the other hand, if u and v were not in_proximity, the SP checks if there is any update in SS.sub.UNL(u, v).  If there is no such update or the updated CSS.sub.UNL(u, v) is still empty, then u and v are still non-proximity and nothing
else needs to be done.  Otherwise, the SP probes v for her updated signatures in all levels to calculate the new relation of u and v. If they are now in_proximity, the SP replies to both with CSS.sub.0(u, v); otherwise, the SP replies to both with UNL(u,
v).  Note that throughout the service running time, the SP needs to maintain the same data structure as the users, i.e., CSS.sub.0(u, v) or UNL(u, v) of all (u, v) pairs.
<br/><br/> With reference to FIG. 6, there is illustrated an example of three users a, b, c (602).  For simplicity, it is assumed only 1 grid in each level and m=2.  Initially none of them are in_proximity with the other, and their mutual UNLs are listed
in the table.  When a moves to a', since only the signature of level 0 (600) is changed, and UNL(a)=1, a does not need to update.  When b moves to b', since the signature of level 1 (601) is changed, and UNL(b)=1, b must update its signatures.  To
reevaluate the relation of a, b, a is probed.  As CSS.sub.0(a, b)={sig(x)}=O, they are in_proximity and both will receive {sig(x)} as the reply.  When c moves to c', since the signature of level 2 is changed, and UNL(c)=2, c must update its signatures. 
Both a and b are probed to re-evaluate their relations with c, both of which are non-proximity.  They both receive the updated UNL=0 as the reply.
<br/><br/> Examples of Empirical Results for One Embodiment of the Present Invention.
<br/><br/> In one example attempt at evaluating the performance of one embodiment of the present invention, The data are generated from the moving object generator as described in T. Brinkhoff and O. Str, "A framework for generating network-based moving
objects," Geoinformatica, vol. 6, pp.  153-180, 2002, based on the German city Oldenburg, which has been widely used in related studies by both Mascetti et al. and Siksnys et al. The dataset covers an area of 14.times.12.26 km.sup.2, and contains
N=50,000 users.  The generator creates the location of each user in every timestamp.  The users are divided into social network groups whose average group size g_size=50.  Table 3 summarizes the default settings of system parameters.  The code of these
experiments is implemented in C#, although any other computing programming language or computing instructions are possible.  The multi-threaded simulation test bed, was, in this example, executed on a desktop computer with Intel Core2 Quad processor
Q6600 and 4 GB RAM, running Windows XP 32-bit edition.  For the cryptographic hashing algorithm, SHA-256 was used and is arranged to generate digests of 256 bits.  For performance evaluation, measurements where made to the communication cost in terms of
the number of bytes exchanged per-timestamp per user.  To evaluate the system scalability, the server CPU time per-timestamp was also measured.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00003 TABLE 3 Parameter setting for experiments Parameter Symbol Value # of users N 50,000 Avg.  group size g_size 50 Avg.  moving speed v 10 m/s Proximity threshold .delta.  100 m Multi-grid scaling factor m 3 Number of grids n 32
<br/><br/> In the first experiment, it was verified that embodiments of the present invention included the use of an optimal grid placement.  In this first experiment, a single level overlay, vary the number of grids n and measure the false negative rate. 
FIG. 7(a) plots the values of both random and optimal grid placement, together with their expected values as derived in Table 2.  The experiment values align well with the expected values, which verifies the claim that the optimal placement saves more
than 50% of the grids from the random placement.  For the following experiments, n=32 grids was consistently used, where the false negative rate is around 6%.  In one example, this value of n may be low enough for most of users.
<br/><br/> The second experiment tests the impact of proximity threshold .delta..  By varying .delta.  from 400 to 25 meters and measure the communication cost and server CPU time.  FIG. 7(b) plots the results.  It was observed that even though .delta. 
drops to 1/16 from 400 to 25, i.e., more users become in_proximity, the communication cost only increases by about 65% and the server CPU time is almost unaffected.  This is attributed to the multi-level grid overlay and the efficient signature update
scheme that greatly reduces the update and reevaluation costs.
<br/><br/> The third experiment tests the scalability of the proposed solution.  By varying the number of users N from 1,000 to 100,000 and the average group size from 10 to 90.  FIG. 7(c) plots the server CPU time with regard to N, which increases
linearly as N increases.  Further, since proximity detection is independent on different social groups, the system can be easily parallelized by delegating the execution to different processing cores.  As such, the server CPU time can always be reduced
as needed.  FIG. 7(d) plots the results with regard to g_size.  It is possible to observe that as g_size increases, the communication cost increases much slower, thanks to the multi-level signature update scheme that keeps most of non-proximity pairs in
the upper levels.  As an indicator, the server CPU time even drops as g_size increases.  These results show that the system scales well to large number of users or large group size.
<br/><br/> The present invention, at least in one embodiment, is advantageous in that it is able to provide solutions to the location privacy issue in mobile geo-social networks.  In one example, the invention is an embodiment of a system for providing
proximity information and may operate as a complete solution for the "nearby friend alert" service, which is a common and fundamental service.  Under the umbrella of grid-and-hashing paradigm, there are at least two techniques that significantly increase
the detection accuracy while saving the wireless bandwidth--optimal grid overlay and multi-level grids.  Based on these two techniques, it was devised that the client-side location update scheme and the server-side update handling procedure for
continuous proximity detection.
<br/><br/> In alternative embodiments, certain embodiments may be further altered so as to operate with the general L.sup.p norm distance, where the Manhattan distance is its special case (p=1).  This distance metric could facilitate a more versatile set
of geo-social services where contexts of distance are different, such as location-based games, virtual reality, and location-aware advertising.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the present invention discloses a method for privacy-preserving proximity detection comprising a grid-and-hashing paradigm, an optimal grid overlay and multi-level grids, which increases the detection accuracy while saving
the wireless bandwidth.  Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention may also provided a client-side location update scheme and the server-side update handling procedure for continuous proximity detection.  Embodiments of the present invention may
also be efficient and scalable under various system parameters and user moving speeds, in mobile geo-social networks.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the different functions discussed herein may be performed in a different order and/or concurrently with each other.  Furthermore, if desired, one or more of the above-described functions may be optional or may be combined.
<br/><br/> The embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented using general purpose or specialized computing devices, computer processors, or electronic circuitries including but not limited to digital signal processors (DSP), application specific
integrated circuits (ASIC), field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), and other programmable logic devices configured or programmed according to the teachings of the present disclosure.  Computer instructions or software codes running in the general purpose
or specialized computing devices, computer processors, or programmable logic devices can readily be prepared by practitioners skilled in the software or electronic art based on the teachings of the present disclosure.
