       <p> An activity monitor which can be pre-programmed at the factory, the
     doctor's office or the pharmacist, or that can be programmed by the user.
     The activity monitor is affixed to a medicine bottle or container and
     activity associated with the bottle or container, such as movement,
     opening, volume changes, etc. are monitored in view to the schedule. If
     the schedule indicates that a dose of medicine should be taken at a
     particular time, but the monitored activity does not determine that the
     medicine has been taken, an alert signal will be issued to alert the user
     that it is time to take the medicine. In addition, if the monitored
     activity indicates that the medicine bottle has been opened prior to a
     scheduled time, then a tamper alert can be triggered.

<br/><br/> One of the cruelest jokes we have ever played on ourselves is the naming of the memory medicine Ginkgo Biloba.  Not a smart marketing strategy either.  Nonetheless, the product tends to sell and a reason for the sales may simply be that most of
us are plagued and frustrated by memory failures.  These symptoms manifest itself in trying to remember a person's name, an item that our spouse asked us to pick up at the grocery store, or even simply the reason that we got up off of the couch, walked
all the way into another room in the house and then stood there wondering why.  Most of these situations can be comically laughed off; however, there are situations where memory failures can be quite problematic or even catastrophic.
<br/><br/> A perfect example of a situation in which the adverse effect of memory lapses can be realized is in the taking or administering of medication.  Depending on the medication and the individual, failure to take medication can result in severe harm. In view of this, one can appreciate that it can be very important to remember to take or administer medication, and to do so in a timely manner.  Thus, what is needed in the art is a mechanism that can remind or notify an individual that he or she must
take or administer medication, and even when the medication must be taken or administered.
<br/><br/> Another example of a situation in which the adverse effect of memory lapses can be realized is in remembering that you have already received or administered a medication.  Such memory lapses can result in an overdose of a medication.  In view of
this, one can appreciate that it would be advantageous to have a device that keeps track of taken and/or administered dosages, notifies or alerts an individual attempting to take or administer an overdose and/or takes measures to help prevent overdosing.
<br/><br/> Most medications that are prescribed to individuals, as well as animals, are provided in containers, such as pill bottles, bottles of serum, or pill pouches etc. The packaging for medication can conveniently operate as a dosage reminder/control
gateway in that the person taking or administering the medication at a minimum, must approach the packaging to obtain the dosage.  In view of this characteristic, there is a need in the art for a dosage reminder or overdose preventer mechanism that can
be attached to, adhered to or otherwise be associated with the packaging.
<br/><br/> Related to these needs in the art there are additional needs in the art with respect to determining if a container in general has been opened, moved, tampered with, etc., as well as providing historical data about such activity with the
container and providing alerts regarding such activity.  These needs in the art can arise in a variety of settings, and a few examples include detecting movement or opening of a liquor bottle, detecting opening of a liquor or gun cabinet, detecting
movement of a moisture testing apparatus, etc.
<br/><br/> Therefore, there is a need in the art for a device that can be used to detect when a container, such as a medicine package or otherwise, has been moved, opened or otherwise tampered with, collecting and storing information about such activity,
and reporting to or alerting a person or system of such activity.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> In a broad sense, the disclosure presents an activity monitor that can be attached, affixed or integrated into a variety of devices, such as to the existing packaging of consumer goods that otherwise would not have such capability, and provide
monitoring, alerting and/or reporting activity associated with the device.  In one embodiment, the activity monitor operates as a medicine reminder.  This embodiment includes a schedule which can be pre-programmed at the factory, the doctor's office or
the pharmacist, can be programmed by the user, or simply be programmed automatically by learning the behavior of the user.  The activity monitor is then affixed to the medicine bottle and activity associated with the bottle, such as movement, opening,
volume changes, etc. are monitored in view of the schedule.  If the schedule indicates that a dose of medicine should be taken at a particular time, but the monitored activity does not determine that the medicine has been taken, an alert signal will be
issued to alert the user that it is time to take the medicine.  In addition, if the monitored activity indicates that the medicine bottle has been opened prior to a scheduled time, then a tamper alert can be triggered.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the activity monitor operates only as a tamper detector.  In this embodiment, the activity monitor is attached to a device or container and then started.  Any movement or activity associated with the device or container is
analyzed and/or recorded and may result in triggering a tamper alarm.  In some embodiments, the tamper detector may define windows of time during which activity is permitted to occur and during which activity is not permitted to occur.  Activity
occurring during a permitted window will not trigger a tamper alarm.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present disclosure, as well as features and aspects thereof, is directed towards an activity monitor device, apparatus and/or method that monitors activity associated with a container.  More specifically, one embodiment of the activity
monitor utilizes an accelerometer to detect movement of the container and based on the movement, type of movement, and timing of the movement, can heuristically determine the type of activity associated with the movement.  In another embodiment of the
activity monitor, an alert or alarm component may be used to signal or indicate that the container has been moved or opened.  In yet another embodiment of the activity monitor, signals may be provided based on a timing component to alert a user or device
that the container should be accessed.  It will be appreciated that the activity monitor presented in this disclosure may be used in a variety of settings and environments, and may be used for a variety of purposes.  Specific examples are illustrated and
described within the disclosure to provide a general, overall and specific understanding of the various aspects, functions, operations and capabilities of the activity monitor but, such specific examples are provided as non-limiting examples.
<br/><br/> One specific example in which an embodiment of the activity monitor may be utilized in within the context of a medicine bottle is activity monitor.  In this example, the activity monitor can operate as a medicine reminder to: (a) signal a user
that it is time to take or administer the specific prescription medication, vitamin, over the counter medication, herb etc. (collectively referred to as medicine) that is stored in the bottle, (b) alert or indicate to the user that the medicine has
already been taken and that no additional dosages are due at the present time, (c) assist the user in finding the medicine bottle, and/or (d) alert or indicate to the user that someone has moved or opened the bottle at an inappropriate time.
<br/><br/> Further elaborating on activity monitor for a medicine bottle, one embodiment may include a small device that can be attached to the top or cap of the medicine bottle.  When the cap on the monitored medicine bottle has not been opened at a
scheduled time the activity monitor enters a "reminder alert" state indicating that the content in the medicine bottle has not been taken at its scheduled time or within a scheduled window of time.  Additionally, the activity monitor can alert the user
if the container has been improperly tampered with by someone that the content is not intended for (e.g. teenage kids in the household) and signals this to the user by entering a "tamper alert" state.  Further, the activity monitor can provide a
higher-level of service by recording and providing or sending the time and the dosage taken of a medication to a central system.  This information, along with other information that can be collected by other health monitoring devices (such as that
manufactured by Dexcom) attached to the body can be pertinent information to provide a more real-time evaluation of the performance and impact that a medication is having on a patient, rather than having to make a 2 month follow-up visit.
<br/><br/> Turning now to the figures in which several embodiments of the activity monitor are presented and common elements are represented with common labels, the various elements of the embodiments are presented in more detail.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 1A and 1B are a conceptual depiction of one embodiment of the activity monitor with FIG. 1A illustrating a top view and FIG. 1B illustrating a side view.  The activity monitor 100 includes a case 110.  Positioned on the top of the case 110
are four buttons 120 (A, B, C and D) and an alert element 130.  The activity monitor 100 includes electronic circuitry and/or software, including an accelerometer and a battery power source 140 (shown in dotted lines as they are embedded within the
device).  The electronic circuitry interfaces to the four buttons or actuators 120, the accelerometer and the alert element 130.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a functional block diagram of the components of an exemplary embodiment of the electronic circuitry 140.  It will be appreciated that not all of the components illustrated in FIG. 2 are required in all embodiments of the activity
monitor, but each of the components are presented and described in conjunction with FIG. 2 to provide a complete and overall understanding of the components.  The electronic circuitry can include a general computing platform 140 illustrated as including
a processor/memory device 204 that may be integrated with each other or, communicatively connected over a bus or similar interface 206.  The processor 204 can be a variety of processor types including microprocessors, micro-controllers, programmable
arrays, custom IC's etc. and may also include single or multiple processors with or without accelerators or the like.  The memory element of 204 may include a variety of structures, including but not limited to RAM, ROM, magnetic media, optical media,
bubble memory, FLASH memory, EPROM, EEPROM, etc. The processor, or other components may also provide components such as a real-time clock, analog to digital convertors, digital to analog convertors, etc. The processor 204 also interfaces to a variety of
elements including a control interface 202, a display adapter 208, audio adapter 210, an accelerometer 212 and network/device interface 214.  The control interface 202 provides an interface to external controls 120, such as sensors, actuators or the
like.  The display adapter 208 can be used to drive a variety of alert elements 130, such as display devices including an LED display, LCD display, one or more LEDs or other display devices.  The audio adapter 210 interfaces to and drives another alert
element 130', such as a speaker or speaker system, buzzer, bell, etc. The network/device interface 214 may interface to a variety of devices (not shown) such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pin pad, and audio activate device, a PS3 or other game controller, as
well as a variety of the many other available input and output devices or, another computer or processing device 226.  The network/device interface 214 can also be used to interface the computing platform 140 to other devices through a network 220.  The
network may be a local network, a wide area network, wireless network, a global network such as the Internet, or any of a variety of other configurations including hybrids, etc. The network/device interface 214 may be a wired interface or a wireless
interface.  The computing platform 140 is shown as interfacing to a server 222 and a third party system 224 through the network 220.  A battery or power source 228 provides power for the computing platform 140.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments the activity monitor may interact with other activity monitors or devices through a zigbee type network architecture.  In such an embodiment, the activity monitors can gain intelligence by detecting, receiving and learning
other activities or other drugs, medications or substances that were also taken, and at what time (e.g. other vitamins with certain food, this drug with this food, etc.) and then interface with the other devices to provide recommendations, warnings or
instructions about any potential overdoses, drug interactions, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a conceptual diagram illustrating one environment suitable for various embodiments of the activity monitor.  In this embodiment, the activity monitor 100 is shown as being attached or affixed to a medicine bottle 300 containing
medicine to be administered.  The activity monitor 100 is attached to the top cap of the medicine bottle using any of a variety of techniques, including gluing, adhesive tape, snaps or similar rigid connectors, a screw, tabs, etc. One embodiment of the
activity monitor 100 includes a pre-attached adhesive tape component with a protective cover.  In this embodiment, to attach the activity monitor 100 to the medicine bottle 300, the adhesive protector is simply removed and the tacky surface is pressed
against the medicine bottle top or cap.  From this point, the activity monitor 100 is then ready to be programmed or activate to schedule and/or monitor use of the content in the container.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a conceptual diagram illustrating another environment suitable for various embodiments of the activity monitor.  In this embodiment, the activity monitor 100 is shown as being attached, affixed or integrated into a cork or stopper for
a bottle, such as a liquor bottle, medicine bottle or any other type bottle 400.  In this embodiment, the activity monitor 100 can come with the bottle 400 or sold separately and use after the bottle is initially opened.  Once the stopper with the
activity monitor 100 is inserted into the bottle, the bottle can then be monitored.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a conceptual diagram illustrating another environment suitable for various embodiments of the activity monitor.  In this embodiment, the activity monitor 100 is shown as being attached, affixed or integrated into a screw-on bottle cap
510, such as a liquor bottle, medicine bottle or any other type bottle 500.  In this embodiment, the activity monitor 100 can come with the bottle 500 or can be sold separately and used after the bottle is initially opened.  Once the stopper with the
activity monitor 100 is attached to the cap and the cap is placed onto the bottle, the bottle can then be monitored.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an activity monitor with an adhesive connector.  In this embodiment, underside of the activity monitor 100 includes an adhesive tape, such as a double sided tape 600 that is attached to the underside
of the activity monitor 100.  The opposing side of the adhesive tape is typically covered by a plastic coating or shield to prevent the adhesive from inadvertently being attached to a surface or gathering debris.  Various other attachment mechanisms may
also be used including Velcro or any loop and hook technique as well as similar structures.  When the activity monitor 100 is being put to use, the plastic cover can be removed and the activity monitor 100 can be attached to the surface of the container
or object to be monitored.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an activity monitor built into a cap structure.  In this embodiment, the activity monitor 100 is integrated into a cap 700 that can be attached to various bottles compatible with the given cap size. 
As is typical for a bottle cap, ridges 710 may be included on the surface of the cap to facilitate removal and placement.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an alternate location of attaching the activity monitor to a bottle.
<br/><br/> Thus, it will be appreciated that the activity monitor may come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, forms, configurations etc., and the above-presented embodiments have been provided as non-limiting examples.
<br/><br/> Operation of the Activity Monitor
<br/><br/> The operation of the activity monitor will be described in three functional stages to facilitate a better understanding.  However, it should be appreciated that the functional stages can be mutually exclusive of each other or, in some
embodiments two or more stages may coexist on a single activity monitor.
<br/><br/> The three stages include: (1) programming; (2) operational; and (3) reporting.
<br/><br/> Programming Stage.
<br/><br/> The programming stage involves the setting up of the activity monitor to perform a desired function.  The activity monitor can be provided as a pre-programmed device with fixed, non-changeable settings or, the activity monitor can include a user
interface for changing, modifying and programming the operation of the activity monitor.  In the former embodiment, the programming stage of the activity monitor occurs during factory construction or, may simply be a default due to memory and/or hardware
configurations of the activity monitor.  In the latter embodiment, the activity monitor includes a user interface that allows the user to program, modify or configure the operation of the activity monitor.
<br/><br/> The programming of the activity monitor configures the activity monitor for a specific application or use.  In one embodiment, the activity monitor is set at factory fabrication to include one or more operational configurations.  Thus, the
activity monitor can be fabricated for different and specific applications.  In other embodiments, general purpose activity monitors that include several pre-programmed features can be configured at fabrication.  In yet other embodiments, the activity
monitor may include configurable features and operations that can be selected and/or adjusted after fabrication, either at the factory or by a distributor, seller, OEM, or user of the activity monitor.
<br/><br/> For programmable embodiments, the activity monitor will include an interface for either programming the activity monitor, selecting features of the activity monitor, or setting parameters to adjust the operation of one or more features of the
activity monitor.  The programming interface may range from a rudimentary interface of a few buttons with audible or led light feedback confirmation to an elaborate, PC based application program that configures and programs the activity monitor through a
port, such as a wireless port (e.g. 802.11, BlueTooth, Zigbee, etc.) or a wired port (e.g. USB, FIREWIRE, etc.).  Furthermore, such an application may allow various software downloads into the activity monitor, including software upgrades, selection and
activation of desired features, parameter settings, etc. Furthermore, programming can occur from the system level based on information that was obtained based on the customers use pattern.  Doctors, pharmaceuticals, children, Grandparents, etc. who are
authorized to make schedule changes can program the device from the system.
<br/><br/> Operational Stage.
<br/><br/> Once the activity monitor is programmed, it is ready to enter operational stage.  However, the activity monitor may remain dormant for an extended period of time before it placed into the operational stage.  Also, the reader should understand
that even if the operational stage is entered, the programming stage can be reentered at any time for embodiments that allow reprogramming of the activity monitor.  The operational stage may be entered or triggered in a variety of fashions.  A few
non-limiting examples including pushing an "on" button, removing a plastic cover over the battery to allow continuity, removing a cover from a photovoltaic sensor, etc. During the operational stage, the activity monitor monitors various sensors and makes
operational decisions based on such monitoring.  For instance, the activity monitor may monitor one or more accelerometers, a photovoltaic sensor, biometric sensor, a pressure switch, a magnetic switch, an electromagnetic switch, RFID detectors, user
interface buttons etc. During the operational stage, the activity monitor may also record data into its internal memory or, transmit date to an external device over a wired or wireless interface.
<br/><br/> Reporting Stage.
<br/><br/> Upon completion of the operational stage or, at some point after the operational stage is entered, it may be desired to extract data from the activity monitor.  This is referred to as the reporting stage.  The types of data, frequency of
reports, etc. can vary greatly depending on the particular use of the activity monitor.  In any case, in the reporting stage the data that is stored internal to the activity monitor or, that has been previously extracted is reviewed and any necessary
reports that reflect information about the data can be generated.
<br/><br/>Examples of Embodiments
<br/><br/> Although the reader will appreciate that a wide variety of uses could be employed for the activity monitor, a few non-limiting examples are provided to illustrate the various capabilities, aspects and functions of various embodiments of the
activity monitor.
<br/><br/> Medicine Reminder.
<br/><br/> One feature that may be incorporated into an embodiment of the activity monitor includes the medicine reminder feature.  This feature operates to alert a person or a person caring for a person, patient, animal, etc., that it is time to
administer a dosage of the medication contained within a bottle.  Thus, the activity monitor is attached to the bottle of interest.  The activity monitor is programmed to provide an alert at the specific dosage times.  For instance, if the medicine is to
be taken in 4 dosages throughout a 24 hour period, the activity monitor can be programmed to provide the alert every 6 hours.  In some embodiments, the exact hours are fixed (such as 6 am, 12 pm, 6 pm and 12 am) but, in other embodiments the exact hours
can be adjusted through the user interface, at the factory or based on the specific times that the activity monitor is used in the learn mode (e.g., 8 am, 12 pm, 5 pm and 11 pm--because this works best with the user's schedule) configuration.  When the
activity monitor provides the alert, the activity monitor then begins to monitor the bottle activity.  If the activity monitor does not detect that the bottle has been tended to, such as the accelerometer detecting that the bottle has been moved or
opened, or other sensors in the activity monitor detect activity that indicates the same, then the activity monitor may be programmed to provide an escalating alert notification (e.g., an increasingly louder alarm).  If the activity monitor detects that
the bottle has been moved or opened, or that medicine has been removed from the container, then the alarm can automatically be reset.  In other embodiments, the activity monitor may include a reset button to silence the alert condition and begin the next
cycle.
<br/><br/> Medicine Alarm.
<br/><br/> Another feature that may be incorporated into an embodiment of the activity monitor includes the medicine alarm.  The feature operates to help prevent over dosages of a medication.  For instance, if this feature is combined with the medicine
reminder feature, once the activity monitor detects that the medication has been taken, a lock-out timer can be initiated.  If the activity monitor detects that the bottle or container has been moved or opened during the lock-out period, an alert can be
triggered to notify the user that no dosages are presently due to be administered or taken.
<br/><br/> Tamper Detector.
<br/><br/> Another feature that may be incorporated into an embodiment of the activity monitor includes a tamper detector.  As a tamper detector, the activity monitor can be affixed or attached to a variety of items or containers.  If the activity monitor
detects that the device or container has been moved, opened, jarred, etc., it can record such information as a data entry and/or provide an alert indicator.  The tamper detector may also include windows of time at which activity would be considered to be
a tamper, and windows of time during which activity is permissible.  For instance, liquor bottles in a bar would include a window of permissible activity during working hours but, if the bottle is moved while the bar is closed, this would be considered
as a tamper.  The tamper detector may be configured such that the entrance of a specific key sequence or authorization code can be used to silence the alarm or exit the alarm state.  If the code is not entered properly, the alarm condition continues. 
Further, rather than simply sounding an alarm, the tamper detector may also include an interface to provide external notification (i.e., POTS, Cellular, Internet, etc.).
<br/><br/> Closed-Loop Medication Monitor.
<br/><br/> It will be appreciated that the interaction of medication with an individual can vary depending on a wide variety of circumstances and elements.  Such circumstances and elements can include the body weight of the individual, the individual's
metabolism, the dietary habits of the individual, the saturation of the medication in the individual, the absorption rate of the medication, etc. For instance, the activity monitor can be integrated into or with other monitors, sensors and devices to
provide an overall control mechanism for the administration of medication.  As an example, the activity monitor operating as a medicine reminder may be programmed to administer certain dosages of medication at specific times.  However, in response to
feedback from other sources, such feedback being associated with one or more of the above-identified circumstances and elements, as well as others, the dosage amount and periodicity of the dosage can be modified in real-time.  Thus, such an embodiment
provides a closed-loop monitoring system that can help to optimize the administration of medications.
<br/><br/> To further facilitate the understanding of the various aspects, features and applications of the various embodiments of the activity monitor, a few additional non-limiting examples are provided.
<br/><br/> Simplified User Interface.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the activity monitor includes simplified user interface for programming of the medicine reminder function.  In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1A and 1B, the activity monitor includes 4 buttons.  However, it will be
appreciated that the activity monitor can include more or fewer buttons and the 4-button configuration is provided as a non-limiting example only.  In the illustrated embodiment, the medicine reminder operation can be set by a user pressing one of the
four buttons and holding it down for a given period of time (i.e., 10 seconds) to select the mode of operation associated with the button.  If the buttons are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, pressing and holding the button can activate the medicine reminder to sound
an alarm for the selected number of dosages, periodically through a 24 hour period beginning at the current time.  Thus, if the user presses and holds the 3 button down for the required period of time, the user will be notified to take a dose at the
current time (or this may simply be assumed) and then, notified again every 8 hours that another dosage is due.
<br/><br/> In other embodiments, the activity monitor may include intelligence that monitors the activity of the user and adjusts the schedule accordingly.  For instance, if the user takes a certain medication regularly, if the activity monitor detects
that the user is always 1 hour late for a particular dose, then the activity monitor may adjust the dosage time to more align with the user's schedule.  Further, the user may be allowed to program the activity monitor to provide alert notifications at
specific times.  Thus, the user can have a schedule that is not exactly aligned on a periodic basis but is within prescribed parameters for the particular medication.  Further, the schedule may be adjusted due to other factors or data received from other
sources.  For instance, environmental issues (i.e., atmosphere, temperature, stress levels, sleep quantity/quality, etc.) may be used to retard or accelerate the dosage due notice.  For instance, in the case of a migraine patient, a sudden change is
barometric pressure may trigger an earlier notification to take a drug such as Topamax or a Triptan.
<br/><br/> Programmable User Interface.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a state diagram illustrating the operation of a programmable user interface in an exemplary embodiment of the activity monitor.  In this embodiment, the activity monitor 100 can be programmed for multiple alerting times (such as four
schedules) within a given period of time, typically a 24 hour period.  It should be appreciated that although the present example is described as including up to four alert times within a 24-hour period, that any number of alert times over any period of
time could also be utilized.  For instance, the alerts could be based on a time period of a week, 12 hours, or any other time period including varying times between dosages.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment being described, a new activity monitor is first resident in the dormant state 902.  In the dormant state, the activity monitor does not have any power being applied to the circuitry.  To exit the dormant state 902, power is
applied to the activity monitor.  Applying power can be accomplished in a variety of techniques including, but not limited to, moving a switch, installing a battery, removing a battery isolator plastic strip, or the like.  Once power is applied to the
activity monitor, the activity monitor transitions to the virgin mode 904.
<br/><br/> In the virgin mode 904, the activity monitor has power applied to it, but it has not received any programming information or has not received the necessary programming details for operation.
<br/><br/> The embodiment being described includes a learning mode 906 to facilitate self-programming or assisted programming of the activity monitor.  Once the activity monitor is attached to a cap or container, the initial programming is performed by
first placing the activity monitor into a "learning mode".  In an illustrative embodiment, to enter the learning mode, an actuation by a user is performed.  For example, a user may press and hold a particular button, such as the top or center button 120
for a period of time, such as 10 seconds, to cause a transition to the learning mode 906.  However, it will also be appreciated that the activity monitor may automatically transition from the virgin mode 904 to the learning mode 906 after being powered
up or after a particular period of time.  In addition, some embodiments may transition from the dormant mode 902 directly to the learning mode 906.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 is a flow diagram illustrating exemplary steps in an embodiment of the learning mode.  Once the learning mode 906 has been entered, an indicator can be provided as feedback to the user 1002.  For instance, to indicate that the activity
monitor is in the learning mode 906, the buttons 120 may include four external LED's 120 that can blink, alternating between red and green.  When the activity monitor 100 enters the learning mode 906, it resides in this mode for a programming period of
time, such as 24-hours.  During the programming period, the activity monitor monitors the use of, and memorizes/records the use of the container associated with the activity monitor.
<br/><br/> In a typical learning mode 906, a loop can be entered to program one or more schedules based on activity associated with the container.  Initially the activity monitor looks for the detection of activity 1004.  The first time that the container
is opened, accessed or moved within the programming period while learning mode is active, the activity monitor records the time of the activity and associates the time with the program for a schedule 1.  For instance, in a particular embodiment, if
activity is detected 1004, then the time of the activity is recorded for one of the available schedules (such as the next incremental schedule(n)) 1006.  Prior to accepting the activity as a valid programming, the activity monitor may conduct an analysis
of the activity 1008.  The analysis applies heuristics or rules to verify that the activity detected actually constitutes a programming request.  The heuristics may include a variety of rules or criteria.  A few non-limiting examples include:
<br/><br/> (a) is the activity too proximate to other recent activity?
<br/><br/> (b) did the activity meet a threshold activity level, was it too short to constitute an opening, was it too long, etc.?
<br/><br/> (c) is the current time an increment of previously stored schedule times?
<br/><br/> (d) automatically suggesting activating specific times of use based on the med type, information received from the doctor and systems and info from the sleeping patterns, etc.
<br/><br/> Once the activity monitor accepts the activity as a programming action, the program schedule is update and an indicator that schedule(n) has been programmed can be provided through indicator(n) 1010.  Thus, the time of the activity may be stored
in a memory location associated with a first schedule, with each of the LED's on the activity monitor being associated with a schedule as well.  After programming the first schedule, the first LED is changed to represent that the programming for that
schedule has been accepted and is complete.  For instance, the LED may change from alternating between red and green to being a solid green, or simply flashing green.  The remaining LED's on the activity monitor continue blinking to show that learning
mode is still active.
<br/><br/> The activity monitor then determines if the learning mode should be exited 1012 and if not, processing continues at step 1004.  At this point, it should be appreciated that if the activity monitor is being programmed for a medication that is
only taken once a day, then there are no further steps necessary and the learning mode can be exited.  At the end of the programming period, the learning mode will be exited with only one schedule being programmed.  However, the user should be careful
not to take the medication the following day any sooner than a trigger threshold from the first administration to ensure that the activity monitor is not confused as to whether this is a second dosage in the cycle or the beginning of a next cycle.  In
some embodiments, the activity monitor may query the user to resolve such a conflict.
<br/><br/> In addition, some embodiments may also include an actuation mechanism to exit learning mode.  For instance, the same actuation used to enter the learning mode, or some other actuation, may be used to exit the learning mode.  As a specific
example, when the learning mode is active, the user may exit the learning mode by either allowing the programming period to expire or, by manually exiting the learning mode (i.e., pressing and holding the center button 130 for 10 seconds as a
non-limiting example).
<br/><br/> For medications or items that are taken multiple times per day or per programming period, the user simply takes such content at the necessary times as prescribed/desired during the initial programming period while in the learning mode is active. The activity monitor detects activity associated with the container and, if it concludes that a dosage has been taken, the activity monitor records the additional scheduled times of use in the other scheduled time periods.  For any schedule period that
is not scheduled after the initial programming period learning mode (e.g. schedule #3 and schedule #4 in an example where the user takes dosages only twice daily) the LED's will be clear indicating that there is no activity associated with those
schedules.
<br/><br/> Thus, the learning mode can be exited 1012 in a variety of manners including, but not limited to, the programming period expiring, the user actuating an exit button or the conclusion of programming each of the available schedules.
<br/><br/> Prior to exiting the learning mode, the activity monitor may perform a validation step 1041 to ensure that the programming information is correct or is logical.  The activity monitor can look at the above-identified heuristics as well as other
heuristics to determine if the program entries appear to be a valid program.  For instance, if three schedules are entered in 6 hour increments and a fourth schedule is programmed two hours from the third schedule, the activity monitor may trigger a
programming alert to the user.  Depending on the embodiments of the invention, the programming alert may simply flash indicating that the programming is invalid and needs to be reprogrammed or, a more elaborate user interface may be employed to indicate
what the questionable programming entries are and allow the user to remedy or override.
<br/><br/> After the initial programming period, the activity monitor exits the learning mode 906 and enters operational mode or monitoring mode 908.  In the operational mode 908, the activity monitor monitors the activity associated with the container in
view of the program schedules.  By applying a set of heuristics or rules, the activity monitor makes a determination as to whether or not compliance with the programmed schedules appears to have occurred or if action needs to be taken.  FIG. 11 is a flow
diagram illustrating typical steps in an exemplary operational mode.
<br/><br/> Initially, the activity monitor 100 may provide an indicator that the activity monitor is in operational mode 1102.  The operational mode 908 indicator can be presented in a variety of manners, such as a constantly illuminated LED, a flashing
sequence of LEDs or any of a variety of other techniques.  Similar to the learning mode 906, the operational mode 908 then looks for the detection of activity associated with the container but, the operational monitor loop also looks at the program
schedules.  In the illustrated embodiment, the activity monitor 100 seeks to detect activity associated with the container 1104.  If activity is not detected the program scheduling is examined to determine if an event has been missed 1106.  If an event
has been missed, an alert indicator is provided 1108 and the alert mode 910 is entered.  As a specific example, if a user fails to remove the cap of a container within a threshold period of time after a scheduled time (i.e., 15 minutes as a non-limiting
example), the activity monitor provides an alert indicator and then enters an alert mode 910.  In addition, the LED in the schedule period in which the cap has not been opened will blink RED further indicating that the content has not been taken.
<br/><br/> If activity is detected 1104, then the activity is analyzed in view of the afore-mentioned heuristics and rules, as well as others, in view of the program schedules 1110.  If the activity is valid and is associated with a valid, scheduled event,
then an indicator may be provided that the programmed event has been satisfied 1114 and processing continues at step 1104 to monitor additional activity.  However, if the detected activity is not valid or associated with a valid event, then the activity
monitor may trigger a tamper alert and provide an alert indicator 1108 as it transitions into the alert mode 910.  As an example, one embodiment of the activity monitor may by default, monitor the use of the cap during the scheduled times and transition
to an alert mode if the cap is removed more than 30 minutes prior to a scheduled period.  In one embodiment, the activity monitor, when entering tamper alert mode, may chirp rapidly and loud and flash the LED, indicating that the cap has been removed
outside of the scheduled periods of use.  In other embodiments, a silent alarm may be employed so that only the valid user knows that the container has been tampered.  In yet other embodiments, a signal may be sent to another device, such as a cellular
telephone or pager through any of a variety of transmission techniques, to sound an alarm or provide a tamper alert indicator.  It will be appreciated that a wide variety of alerts can be provided in the various embodiments.  A few non-limiting examples
include pre-recorded phrases, sound clips, ring tones, buzzers, tones, vibrations, pings, or the like.
<br/><br/> As previously described, the alert mode may be entered due to a missed scheduled event or due to a tamper event.  Other alert modes may also be defined and employed in other embodiments of the activity monitor.  In the described embodiment, the
alert mode can be reset or exited if the alert was caused by a missed event.  However, if the alert was caused by a tamper, the activity monitor cannot be reset or can only be reset by entering a pass code.
<br/><br/> To exit the alert mode, the user must actuate the device.  In one embodiment, the alert mode 910 may be exited simply by opening the container and taking the medicine dosage.  In other embodiments, one or more buttons can be pressed and held for
a period of time to cause a transition out of the alert mode 910.  Various exit means may also be used if it is desired to have the activity monitor exit to a desired state.  For instance, the activity monitor may exit to the virgin state 904 in response
to one actuation, the learning mode 906 in response to a second actuation and the operational mode 908 in response to a third actuation.
<br/><br/> If the alert mode 910 was entered due to a tamper event, the user may be required to not only actuate the activity monitor, but then in response to a prompt, enter a pass code to allow transition from the alert mode.  As an example for the
embodiment presented in FIGS. 1A and 1B, a user may be required to press and hold a center button that may be a part of the alert element 130 for 10 seconds to initiate a transfer out of a tamper event triggered alert mode.  The activity monitor may then
provide an indicator, such as flashing LED's and/or a sound to indicate that the user must provide the pass code.  The user may then enter a sequence of buttons 120 that satisfies the required pass code.  It should be appreciated that the pass code may
be factory set and provided to the user along with the activity monitor, or the pass code can be programmed by the user in virgin mode 904 or the learning mode 906.  As another example, to exit a tamper alert mode, the user may be required to remove the
cap and place it on the counter for 30 seconds making sure it's stationary for at least 30 seconds.  Next the cap can be replaced on the container and then by pressing and holding the center button for a prolonged period of time (i.e., 15 seconds).  In
another embodiment, an external device may be required to cause the activity monitor 100 to exit the tamper alert mode.  For instance, a key may physically be entered into the activity monitor to reset the tamper alarm or, a signal from an external
device, such as a cellular telephone, RFID tag, etc. may be used to reset the tamper alert mode.
<br/><br/> One embodiment of the activity monitor is a tamper detector.  In this embodiment, the activity monitor can be used exclusively to monitor the inappropriate or unauthorized use of any bottle with a cap, such as prescription drugs, alcohol, sodas
in the fridge for children on special diets, etc. To program activity monitor to operate exclusively in a tamper alert mode around the clock (i.e. no programmed schedules) the activity monitor is placed into the learning mode.  An indicator is then
provided to the user, such as the LED's blinking and alternating from red to green indicating it's in the learning mode.  While in the learning mode, the activity monitor may then be set to operate as a tamper detector only using a variety of techniques. In other embodiments, the activity monitor may come factory set to only operate as a tamper detector.
<br/><br/> As a non-limiting example, for the above-describe embodiment that includes 4 program schedules, a tamper only monitor mode can be invoked by using the following programming sequence:
<br/><br/> (1) attach the activity monitor to the container;
<br/><br/> (2) set the container down in a stable and stationary position for a threshold period of time, the time of 30 seconds is used as a non-limiting example throughout this procedure;
<br/><br/> (3) remove the cap and place the cap on the counter for 30 seconds making sure the cap is stationary--after 30 seconds, LED #1 will turn green;
<br/><br/> (4) place the cap back onto the container and wait 30 additional seconds making sure the cap and container are stationary; and
<br/><br/> (5) open the cap again repeating the process 3 more times by opening the cap and replacing the cap as described above.  Once programmed in the tamper alert mode, all of the LED's will blink green 5 times and then they will be clear indicating
that the tamper detection mode has been successfully programmed to monitor any use of the cap at any time.
<br/><br/> At this point, if activity is detected, the activity monitor will enter the tamper alert mode.  It will be appreciated that a variety of other techniques can be used such as pressing and holding certain button combinations, or entering certain
button sequences.
<br/><br/> In a computer interface enabled embodiment of the present invention, the activity monitor can be communicatively coupled to a computer for programming.  In such an embodiment, a wireless technique or a wired technique may be utilized.  An
application program may be presented on the computer to identify the connected activity monitor and provide programming instructions and capabilities for the activity monitor.  In addition, the programmed schedules can be read from the activity monitor
for evaluation, and the historical activity of the activity monitor may be accessed and analyzed.
<br/><br/> In a particular embodiment of the present invention, the activity monitor may be programmed at a pharmacy at the time medication is dispensed to a customer.  Thus, the pharmacist can program the activity monitor in accordance with the doctor's
prescription.  Similarly, the activity monitor can be programmed at the doctor's office and provided to the patient.  For example, the activity monitor can be programmed automatically based on the type of drug and the information received from the doctor
(i.e., which may have been sent automatically to the pharmacist,) as well as, or pre-provided or presently provided user preferences.
<br/><br/> One aspect that can be incorporated into various embodiments of the activity monitor is a "buy-now" or "order-now" feature.  This feature provides a button on the activity monitor that can be pressed to trigger or initiate an order for a refill. For example, the activity monitor may be provided with the prescription information stored within its memory.  Further, the activity monitor may be wireless tethered to an Internet connected device, such as a BLACKBERRY or IPHONE.  When the "buy-now"
button is pressed, prescription information may be read out of the activity monitor and then transmitted to the user's pharmacy requesting a refill or to the doctor's office requesting a renewal of the prescription.  Similarly, the activity monitor could
be utilized with a variety of consumables and operate to provide such notice to a user with regards to a need to purchase additional quantity.
<br/><br/> Another aspect that can be incorporated into various embodiments is the feature of sending alert messages to various devices and individuals.  For instance, for an elderly person, if an alert condition is detected, a message may be sent to the
user's children to notify them to come and check on their parent.  The messages can be sent in a variety for forms, such as pages, text messages, twitter postings, <b><i>facebook</i></b> postings, email messages, etc.
<br/><br/> In addition, the activity monitor may send alert messages to indicate that it is time to take a dose of medicine.  For instance, the activity monitor may send a text message, email message, or any other variety of messages to a user's device,
such as a cellular telephone, PDA, IPHONE, etc. The user is then notified that it is time to take his or her medication.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the activity monitor may simply include accelerometer(s) to detect movement.  However, in other embodiments the activity monitor may include more complex technology to measure volumes of material within the container.  In
such an embodiment, the activity monitor can effectively notify a user when the dosage taken was too small, too large or just right.  In addition, this embodiment of the activity monitor can detect when the contents are getting low and initiate or alert
that it is time to refill the prescription.  For instance, the activity monitor may include a sensor, such as a depth finder technology sensor, that can be used to determine the volume of contents.  When the activity monitor is first installed, the
sensor conducts an initial volume check.  After each subsequent opening, the sensor again checks to content volumes.  If an unusual change in volume is detected, or if no change is detected when a change was expected, and alert can be provided.
<br/><br/> The activity monitor can be provided and marketed in a variety of manners.  For instance, in one embodiment, the activity monitors may be disposable devices that are thrown away with the empty medicine bottles.  In such an embodiment,
programming can be simplified as the device will be used with only one medicine for a limited period of time.  In such an embodiment, the activity monitor may be sold by itself, or in groups, such as 4 packs and 6 packs, with the batteries already
installed but disabled by use of a plastic isolating strip that can be removed when desired for operation.  In other embodiments, the activity monitor may include a replaceable or chargeable battery and can be reused and reprogrammed multiple times.
