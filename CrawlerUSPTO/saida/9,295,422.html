<br/><br/> The network module 206 is used for communicating to the cloud server 300 to transfer the fitness information, the identity information, or the sport information to the server 300.  Therefore, the server 300 can serve as a platform for an
application system, such as a health food cloud application system, a market cloud application system, a sport cloud application system, a leisure and tourism cloud application system, or a health care assessment and exercise recommendation application
system, to combine the fitness information, the identity information, or the sport information in the application systems such that the user can manage food, fitness and the living conditions via the application system and the server 300 so as to
maintain the health of the user.  The server 300 can also arrange and manage the fitness information, the identity information, or the sport information of the user, such as analyzing and ranking the fitness information for different years, ages or
areas, and provide the results of the analysis to the user, a friend, or the health consultant team via a cellphone messaging or E-mail service to execute related health checks and health care; therefore, the user can completely grasp his or her own
exercise condition (for example, the server 300 can provide the user fitness comparison results, before-and-after sport comparison results, before-and-after health care comparison results, the food control comparison results, a specify type of comparison
results, and other multifunctional cross-comparisons of the average values of the same ages and the user).  After the user receives the integrated results sent from the server 300, the user can choose to print the information or share the information on
a community website (such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or Twitter) to share the sport performance or the health condition information with friends, family, or a specific group.
<br/><br/> The host computer 200 also has a storage device and a database for storing and managing the abovementioned fitness information, the identity information, or the sport information generated when the user operates the multifunction fitness testing
device 1; however, using the storage device to store the information is not the main object of the present invention, and this feature is already disclosed in the related field of information storing computer devices; therefore, there is no need for
further description in the present invention.
