     profiles to aid in memorization of selected information
</font><br/>
       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> An electronic platform allowing users to form and organize groups of
     member profiles, which contain a number of biographical categories (e.g.,
     name, address, etc.) and a personal photo. The electronic platform
     incorporates many different methods of testing the user to assist in the
     memorization of the faces and biographical information of the members of
     the group, i.e., electronic flash cards (one sided or two sided),
     multiple choice quizzes, etc. The users then may either create their own
     custom tests or they may use predesigned quizzes generated by the
     electronic platform.

<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> 1.  Field of the Invention
<br/><br/> This invention relates generally to an electronic platform for forming and organizing groups of member profiles consisting essentially of biographical information, such as name, address, phone number, and a personal photo of the member, and more
particularly, but not by way of limitation, to a computer system and mobile application for user creation and organization of groups of member profiles to aid in memorization of key biographical information.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of the Related Art
<br/><br/> Students, members of Greek organizations, corporate employees and executives, athletes, conference attendees, educators, and countless others often face the task (and in many cases, the problem) of memorizing the names, faces, and biographical
information of members of a group.  These individuals, as well as companies and organizations, which possess the need to facilitate the familiarization, greater interaction, and memorization of the members of their groups and/or event attendees must
relegate themselves to the use of insufficient methods, such as Microsoft PowerPoint.RTM., nametags, business cards, paper flash cards, and others similar to these methods.  These current methods do not include the features of memorizing and increasing
group social familiarity, "gamifing" the experience, and connecting users to members of their groups on a much deeper level.
<br/><br/> Based on the foregoing, it is desirable to provide an electronic platform that enables users to form and organize groups of member profiles, which contain a small but essential number of biographical categories, such as name, address, phone
number, and personal photograph.
<br/><br/> It is further desirable to provide a computing platform that upon completion of group formation, member sign up (such via Facebook.RTM., LinkedIn.RTM., a Google.RTM.  account, or native email-username and password generation), and profile
population, members of groups will have access to digital flash cards and computerized multiple choice quizzes generated by the system to aid them in the memorization of their fellow members' biographical information.
<br/><br/> It is still further desirable to provide a computing platform that allows users to tailor the electronic flash cards and quizzes more specifically on biographical member categories of their choosing and as needed.
<br/><br/> It is yet further desirable to provide a mobile computing application that synchronizes seamlessly with the iOS.RTM., Android.RTM., and Windows.RTM.  phone platforms, as well as a Facebook.RTM.  and LinkedIn.RTM.  application, thereby granting
users access to digital flash cards and computerized multiple choice quizzes conveniently on their mobile devices so that they may practice group memorization with ease at their convenience.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> In general, in a first aspect, the invention relates to a computerized system for forming and organizing groups of member profiles.  The system includes a computer network with a plurality of computers having access to the computer network, and
an electronic platform in the computer network.  The electronic platform is configured to receive requests from any one of the plurality of computers.  The electronic platform includes a database of biographical information organized into groups of
member profiles, and an interface in communication with the database.  The interface is configured to access the groups of member profiles, and is also configured to aid in memorization the biographical information.
<br/><br/> In general, in a second aspect, the invention relates to a computerized method for memorizing biographical information of a group.  The computerized method includes the steps of organizing a database of biographical information into a plurality
of groups.  The groups have a plurality of member profiles associated therewith.  The method also includes providing an application capable of communicating with the database, and directing the application to select one or more of the groups so as to
select a member's biographical information.  A memorization means dynamically replicates the biographical information, which is then displayed to the user for testing. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The systems and methods discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific manners in which to make and use this invention and are not to be interpreted as limiting in scope.
<br/><br/> While the systems and methods have been described with a certain degree of particularity, it is to be noted that many modifications may be made in the details of the construction and the arrangement of the devices, components and/or steps
without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure.  It is understood that the systems and methods are not limited to the embodiments set forth herein for purposes of exemplification.
<br/><br/> In general, the invention relates to an electronic platform for user creation and organization of groups of member profiles to aid in memorization of key biographical information.  The electronic platform may be implemented through a computer
program/application loaded on a standard computer device, such as a mainframe, desktop or other computer.  For example, the computer device may have a central processor that controls the overall operation of the computer and a system bus that connects
the central processor to one or more conventional components, such as a network card or modem.  The computer device may also include a variety of interface units and drives for reading and writing data or files.
<br/><br/> The electronic platform may be a stand-alone computer program/application designed to be packaged/embedded with any standard computer program/application ("host software application").  The electronic platform may include a client application, a
server application, a file repository and database for storage of images and information, and/or a database for storage of unique member and group identifier numbers.  The electronic platform may be implemented with one or more mainframe, desktop or
other computer.  For example, a computer device may use a 64-bit processor.  Each computer device of the electronic platform includes a central processor that controls the overall operation of the computer and a system bus that connects the central
processor to one or more conventional components, such as a network card or modem.  Each computer device may also include a variety of interface units and drives for reading and writing data or files.  Depending on the type of computer device, a user can
interact with the computer using a keyboard, pointing device, microphone, pen device or other input device.  The electronic platform may be connected via a suitable network connection, such as a T1 line, a common local area network ("LAN") or other
mechanism for connecting computer devices.  In addition, the electronic platform may include an application program that is resident on and run by a handheld, portable electronic device, such as a cell phone platform, for example Blackberry.RTM.,
iPhone.RTM.  or other smartphone electronic device or personal digital assistant ("PDA").
<br/><br/> The electronic platform allows users to form and organize groups of member profiles, which contain a number of key biographical categories (e.g., name, address, etc.) and a personal photograph.  The electronic platform incorporates many
different methods of testing the user to assist in the memorization of the faces and biographical information of the members of the group, i.e., electronic flash cards (one sided or two sided), multiple choice quizzes, etc. The users then may either
create their own custom tests or they may use predesigned quizzes generated by the electronic platform.  In addition, users could sign up directly from the electronic platform or they could use a third party sign up, such as Facebook.RTM., LinkedIn.RTM. 
or Google.RTM..  The electronic platform can also include mobile applications that would sync with iOS.RTM., Android.RTM.  and Windows.RTM.  as well as a Facebook.RTM.  or LinkedIn.RTM.  application.  Further, each group can customize the electronic
platform, such as using a visual and color scheme that is fully tailored to the group's themes and logos.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 8, the electronic platform may be implemented as a mobile-based application.  The mobile-based application may take a variety of forms, and may be implemented as a base application or an enhanced application. 
In the base application, users would perform their respective profile creation and group formation functions on the electronic platform as described above.  The application would allow users to perform the flash cards and quiz functions essentially as
described above, with the visual aspects of those functions scaled to fit the particular smartphone or mobile device a user accesses the application while using.  After downloading the base application, users would first log into the electronic platform
through a third party application or using a system-specific username and password, which will in turn populate the users mobile applications with their respective profiles and groups.  Users of the base application would have access to the same levels
and breadths of functionality concerning the flash cards and quizzes as described below with regard to the web-based application.  Visuals would be scaled to fit the respective devices that users would be accessing the mobile application, and all
animations and gestures would be adjusted to accommodate multi-touch functionality.  In the enhanced application, users are able to have full functionality of the electronic platform, such as sign up, profile and group creation, and flash cards and/or
quizzing interfaces, each of which would be scaled to function flawlessly on smartphones and other supporting mobile devices.
<br/><br/> Upon downloading the electronic platform, users will be able to access the platform by touching the application icon that appears on their smartphone screens.  After touching the application icon, users will be directed to sign in using their
email address and password.  If users do not already have an account already, they will be able to touch a button that will navigate them to a website within their mobile devices internet browser to then create an account.
<br/><br/> After signing in, users will first be directed to their profile page, where they will be able to view their picture and biographical data.  Upon touching the "Groups" button, users will be directed to a view of their groups, as well as the
number of members in each respective group.  Upon touching a specific group, users can view a list of the names and photos of each member of that group.  Upon touching a specific member, users will be brought to the profile page of that member.  This
profile page, identical in format to each user's profile page in each specific group, will display a member's photo and biographical information.
<br/><br/> Upon touching the "Flash Cards" button, users will be brought to a list of their groups as well as the number of flash cards (members) in each respective group.  Upon touching a specific group, users will begin to experience a flash card
quizzing system of the members of that group.  Users will first be shown the "primary side" of a flash card, which will be preset by default to be a member's photo.  After viewing the "primary side" of the card and attempting to remember the member whose
biographical information photo is shown, users can touch the "primary side" anywhere on the screen to reveal the member's biographical information that comprises the "secondary side" of the flash card.  A second touch will navigate users to the next
flash card's "primary side."
<br/><br/> Upon touching the "Edit" button, users will be brought to a screen that will allow them to edit the settings of their flash card quizzes.  The flash card settings screen will include a list of biographical data categories common to all members
of a specific group.  Users can activate and/or deactivate these categories as well as select which category will appear on the "primary side" of each flash card.  For example, a user deactivates the "Phone" category from the flash card quiz for his/her
group being quizzed upon.  After deactivating the "Phone" category and pressing the "Done" button, a user will be brought back to the beginning of the flash card quiz and view the "primary side" of the first card.  After touching the screen, in this
example, a user would view the "secondary side" of the card, which no longer contains the "Phone" category.
<br/><br/> Upon touching the "Quiz" button, users will be brought to a list of their groups as well as the number of quiz questions (members) in each respective group.  Upon touching a group, users will begin to experience a multiple choice quiz concerning
the biographical information associated with members of the group they are being quizzed upon.  Users will see a single given "primary" category and four choices of a "secondary" category.  As illustrated, the default "primary" category is "Picture," and
the default "secondary" category is "Name."
<br/><br/> Upon touching the "Edit" button, users will be presented with adjustable quiz settings nearly identical to the adjustable flash card settings.  Users can select and/or deselect categories to be quizzed upon as well as designate a primary
category.  Users can also toggle "On" or "Off" the ability to "Reshuffle Missed Questions," which will cause (or prevent) incorrectly answered questions to be reshuffled back into the quiz and caused to be quizzed upon at a random point later in the
quiz.  Users can also change the settings of the "Answer Choices Needed to Get Correct" feature.  This feature allows users to decide whether they would like to be quizzed upon all selected biographical data categories about each member of their group
(in this example, "Picture" as the "primary" with "Name" and "City" as the "secondary" categories) or about one of the selected biographical data categories as selected at random by the electronic platform.
<br/><br/> After pressing the "Done" button and selecting the "All Active" option, in this example, a user would be presented with the "primary" "Picture" category and four answer choices in the "secondary" category of "Name." After selecting one of the
four "Name" choices, the user would then be presented with four choices of the second "secondary" category selected, "City," pertaining to the same member they selected a name for on the previous screen.  The user must select the correct "Name" and
"City" for the associated "Picture" in order to answer the quiz question correctly in this example.
<br/><br/> In the quiz settings, users can also select "One Random" as the setting for "Answer Choices Needed to Get Correct." The "One Random" setting will cause the four answer choices given with one "primary" item of data to be a random selection of
category from the active data categories selected in the quiz settings.  After pressing the "Done" button, in this example, a user would be presented with one "primary" "Picture" as well as four answer choices from the categories of "Name," "City," or
"Phone" (in this example, "City").  In the next quiz question, the user in this example would then be quizzed upon the same "primary" data category of a different member of their group, but associated with four answer choices of a
different/randomly-selected "secondary" category (in this case, "Name").
<br/><br/> As a website-based application, users will utilize a conventional web browser to access the electronic platform.  Through the web browser, users of the electronic platform can create profiles, create groups, and use tools that aid in the
memorization of knowledge about each of the group's members.
<br/><br/> When signing up for the electronic platform, users may choose differing methods of signup, such as based upon the channel (<b><i>Facebook,</i></b> email, etc.) through which they receive an invitation to join the service (if they join via an invitation).  For
example, users sign up using the "Log In with <b><i>Facebook</i></b>" feature associated with <b><i>Facebook</i></b> and its interface integration Application Program Interface ("API").  Users enter their <b><i>Facebook</i></b> username and password on the electronic platform, are then directed
to their <b><i>Facebook</i></b> account to approve the syncing of the electronic platform with their <b><i>Facebook</i></b> information, "Allow" the transaction, and then use their <b><i>Facebook</i></b> username and password to sign in to the electronic platform each time they wish to sign in.
The electronic platform can also allow users to signup via existing platforms, such as Google and/or Yahoo.  Yet further, the electronic platform can also allow users to sign up by creating a username (e.g., an email address) and password directly within
the electronic platform.  Upon entering this information, the user will receive an email to the given email address asking them to click a link to validate and confirm their account.  After clicking the link, the user will be brought to the profile
generation page of the electronic platform.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIGS. 9 through 16, after creating accounts, users will enter basic biographical data into pre-designed fields to generate profiles.  Most of these fields will be common to all users, but some may be tailored to specific groups
a user could be joining For example, users could enter their names (first and last), the name of the school, group, or organization they will be using the electronic platform to aid in memorizing (if they are not joining a pre-existing group into which
they have been invited), their physical address (if desired or required), and their phone number (if desired or required).  If joining a pre-existing or a partnership program group, users may need to enter other categories of information necessitated by
the group for memorization.  For example, if a user is pledging a fraternity that has created a group, that user may need to enter pledging information such as pledge line number or pledge nickname to use for memorization purposes.  In addition, users
will upload photos of themselves, such as one photo per user, to be used for memorization purposes.
<br/><br/> Once a user has created a profile, he or she can begin to create and form a group of users to make use of the tools on the electronic platform, unless the user is joining the electronic platform in response to a sent group request or the group
has already been created and established through the partnership program.  To create a group, users need to first name the group, as well as select a group photo or logo and upload, if so desired.  After selecting a name and photo (if desired), the user
then enters email addresses of members they wish to add to their group and click a button to send invitations to those addresses.  Once the group has been formed, it becomes the responsibility of the "Admin" user who created the group to manage,
maintain, and update the group as necessary.
<br/><br/> After a group containing multiple members with saturated profiles has been created, any user in the group can navigate to a section of the website to review the members of the group and their respective items of biographical information in the
form of flash cards, such as in a basic form or in a "double-sided" form.  A user reviewing basic flash cards will see an image of a card filled with another user from their group's photo and all biographical information given.  The user will then be
able to click on the card to cycle to the next user in their group's card until they have viewed the cards of all members in their group.  If a user wishes to use flash cards for more of a quizzing purpose, he or she can generate "double-sided" cards. 
In doing so, the user will be shown a list of all biographical fields given to be filled out by the members of the group upon creating profiles (including photo) and will be able to "check" or "uncheck" boxes next to those biographical fields to select
the ones on which he or she would like to be "quizzed." The user will also designate one field as the "primary" field, which will be shown alone on one side of each of the members of the group's flash cards.  After completing this selection, the user
will then cycle through the flash cards.  For example, if a user selected the category of "photo" as the primary field and began to cycle through the flash cards, he or she would first see a group member's photo on a card without any information
surrounding it, would try to discern the name and relevant biographical information of the person in the photo, and would click on the card to reveal the name and biographical information on the "other side" of the card.
<br/><br/> In addition to flash cards, users may also create and engage in multiple-choice quizzes concerning the members of their group and each member's respective biographical information.  When a user navigates to the quiz interface of the electronic
platform, he or she will have the opportunity to immediately engage in a pre-designed basic quiz generated by the electronic platform.  This quiz will show a user a picture of one of the members of their group as well as four names of members of their
group.  The user can then select which of the four names they believe belong to the member in the picture.  If the user answers correctly, the member just tested will be removed from the quiz.  If the user answers incorrectly, that member will be
randomly added back into the quiz at some later point.  The additional options of providing scoring and answer breakdown after the quiz is completed must still be investigated and discussed.
<br/><br/> In the quiz interface of the electronic platform, a user will also have the opportunity to create a more detailed quiz than the basic quiz described above.  The first step in generating this quiz is essentially identical to that of creating
double-sided flash cards in that a user will select which biographical categories to be quizzed upon as well as a "primary" category, which will be the "given" piece of each quiz question, with the other categories comprising the answer choices.  The
processes for correct and incorrect answers will remain the same as described in the basic quiz above.  The user will have two options of quizzing method once the biographical fields have been selected: being quizzed on "random" fields or "all" fields. 
In the random fields quiz, a user will be given one item of primary information as well as four items of data from another category.  The category from which the four items of data come will vary from question to question (depending upon how many
secondary categories the user selected to be quizzed upon) while the primary given item category will remain constant.  For example, if "photo" is the primary category, a user will consistently be given a photo with which he or she may have to match one
of four names for one question, and one of four phone numbers for the next question, etc. In the all fields quiz, a user will be given one item of primary information as well as four items of data from each category selected to be quizzed upon.  To
answer a question correctly, the user must successfully match the correct data item from each category's four choices given to the one primary item of information.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the electronic platform's simplicity and flexibility allow for it to be easily tailored to the specific demands of many potential partner groups and organizations.  Under the partnership program, the electronic platform is
customizable to create a full-service, streamlined membership, group, and flash card and quizzing structure that will best suit the partner's needs.  The electronic platform is useful for a wide array of groups and organizations, such as college Greek
institutions (fraternities and sororities), businesses with memorization and membership needs, conferences, corporate company events, educational classes at all academic levels, college campus clubs and student organizations, non-profit organizations,
and athletic teams.  From visual design to functional specifications, there are numerous ways in which the electronic platform can be tailored to meet the desires of partners.  For example, the electronic platform's color scheme and layout can be
tailored to match a partner's desired color scheme, as well as to add partner organizational logos and images.
<br/><br/> The functional processes implemented to manage the sign up, profile creation, and group formation aspects of the electronic platform can be adjusted to create a more streamlined and less user-intensive experience for partners and their
organizational group members who will be using the platform.  If the partner so desires, the electronic platform can be specifically tailored for the partner organization, as well as tailored with unpopulated profiles for all of its members.  This in
turn will remove the sign up and group formation processes altogether as members that have been pre-selected by the partner to join and use the service, will simply need to sign in to the service using their company, organizational, or given email and a
temporary password given to them before sign up.  User profiles can be custom designed with the biographical fields for which the partner wishes each of its members to provide data.
<br/><br/> Partners may also pre-select the construction of its group's flash cards and quizzes by conveying the optimal biographical fields and primary categories to best suit their members' needs for memorization.  In addition, partners may potentially
be granted control of the advertisements that appear on their tailored platform.  These advertisements include standard website and mobile application banners and side-banner advertisements.  Whether the partners choose to outsource these advertisements,
select them internally, or choose to have no advertisements whatsoever, they will have access to the precisely targeted audience of their own organizational members.
<br/><br/> The electronic platform is a multi-faceted, group-enhancing, and memorization-aiding platform that provides a wide array of benefits to numerous classifications of persons and groups that will become users and partners.  The electronic platform
provides a simple, but greatly needed, service that does not exist in its nature in website or mobile application form.  Students, members of Greek organizations, corporate employees and executives, athletes, conference attendees, educators, and
countless others often face the task (and in many cases, the problem) of memorizing the names, faces, and biographical information of members of a group.  Certain services currently exist to create flash cards and rudimentary tests and surveys, but the
electronic platform provides individuals with a service that makes the act of memorization and increasing group familiarity social, "gamifies" the experience, and connects users to members of their groups on a much deeper level than would be possible
without their use of the electronic platform.  Furthermore, in the current state of service and platform offerings, companies and organizations possessing the need to facilitate the familiarization, greater interaction, and memorization of the members of
their groups and/or event attendees must relegate themselves to the use of insufficient methods such as Microsoft PowerPoint.RTM., nametags, business cards, paper flash cards, and others similar to these methods.  Whether they choose to become partners
to create a tailored and streamlined service to their specific needs or to use the basic platform, companies and organizations gain access to a set of tools that will drastically improve the efficiency, effectiveness, participation, and fun of group
memorization when they use the electronic platform.
<br/><br/> Whereas, the systems and methods have been described in relation to the drawings and claims, it should be understood that other and further modifications, apart from those shown or suggested herein, may be made within the spirit and scope of
this invention.
