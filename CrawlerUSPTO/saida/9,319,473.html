<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 3, wherein the stateful object is a user post to the social-networking system.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 1, wherein the stateful object is associated with a node in a social graph maintained by a social-networking system.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 1, wherein the first notification comprises a message and a payload.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 1, wherein the real-time push service comprises a channel server, a MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) server, and a push service hosted by a carrier network.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 1, wherein: the stateful object comprises user-facing information;  the content in the first notification comprises all the user-facing information associated with the stateful object when the first notification is sent; 
and the update in the second notification comprises all the user-facing information associated with the stateful object when the second notification is sent that was not in the first notification.
<br/><br/> 9.  One or more computer-readable non-transitory storage media embodying software that is operable when executed to: send to a mobile client computing device a first notification through a real-time push service, the first notification
comprising content and being associated with a stateful object, wherein: the stateful object comprises user-facing information;  the content of the first notification comprises a pre-determined subset of the user-facing information associated with the
stateful object at a first time when the first notification is sent;  and the sending is determined by: a priority level of the first notification;  a first power state of the mobile client computing device;  and a first network state of the mobile
client computing device;  and in response to a state change of the stateful object, send to the mobile client computing device a second notification through the real-time push service, the second notification comprising an update to the content based on
the state change of the stateful object, wherein: the update to the content comprises a pre-determined subset of the user-facing information associated with the stateful object at a second time when the second notification is sent, wherein the second
time is later in time than the first time;  and the sending is determined by: a priority level of the second notification;  a second power state of the mobile client computing device;  and a second network state of the mobile client computing device.
<br/><br/> 10.  The media of claim 9, wherein the first or second notification is configured for display by the mobile client computing device.
<br/><br/> 11.  The media of claim 9, wherein the first notification comprises a message and a payload.
<br/><br/> 12.  The media of claim 9, wherein the real-time push service comprises a channel server, a MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) server, and a push service hosted by a carrier network.
<br/><br/> 13.  The media of claim 9, wherein: the stateful object comprises user-facing information;  the content in the first notification comprises all the user-facing information associated with the stateful object when the first notification is sent; 
and the update in the second notification comprises all the user-facing information associated with the stateful object when the second notification is sent that was not in the first notification.
<br/><br/> 14.  A system comprising: one or more processors;  and a memory coupled to the processors comprising instructions executable by the processors, the processors being operable when executing the instructions to: send to a mobile client computing
device a first notification through a real-time push service, the first notification comprising content and being associated with a stateful object, wherein: the stateful object comprises user-facing information;  the content of the first notification
comprises a pre-determined subset of the user-facing information associated with the stateful object at a first time when the first notification is sent;  and the sending is determined by: a priority level of the first notification;  a first power state
of the mobile client computing device;  and a first network state of the mobile client computing device;  and in response to a state change of the stateful object, send to the mobile client computing device a second notification through the real-time
push service, the second notification comprising an update to the content based on the state change of the stateful object, wherein: the update to the content comprises a pre-determined subset of the user-facing information associated with the stateful
object at a second time when the second notification is sent, wherein the second time is later in time than the first time;  and the sending is determined by: a priority level of the second notification;  a second power state of the mobile client
computing device;  and a second network state of the mobile client computing device.
<br/><br/> 15.  The system of claim 14, wherein the first or second notification is configured for display by the mobile client computing device. <hr/> <center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> This disclosure generally relates to mobile computing devices.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A social-networking system, which may include a social-networking website, may enable its users (such as persons or organizations) to interact with it and with each other through it.  The social-networking system may, with input from a user,
create and store in the social-networking system a user profile associated with the user.  The user profile may include demographic information, communication-channel information, and information on personal interests of the user.  The social-networking
system may also, with input from a user, create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social-networking system, as well as provide services (e.g., wall posts, photo-sharing, event organization, messaging, games, or
advertisements) to facilitate social interaction between or among users.
<br/><br/> The social-networking system may transmit over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user.  A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device
of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social-networking system.  The social-networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user, such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of
other users connected to the user.
<br/><br/> A mobile computing device--such as a smartphone, tablet computer, or laptop computer--may include functionality for determining its location, direction, or orientation, such as a GPS receiver, compass, or gyroscope.  Such a device may also
include functionality for wireless communication, such as BLUETOOTH communication, near-field communication (NFC), or infrared (IR) communication or communication with a wireless local area networks (WLANs) or cellular-telephone network.  Such a device
may also include one or more cameras, scanners, touchscreens, microphones, or speakers.  Mobile computing devices may also execute software applications, such as games, web browsers, or social-networking applications.  With social-networking
applications, users may connect, communicate, and share information with other users in their social networks.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a social-networking system may push to a user's mobile client computing device a first notification about a stateful object.  The stateful object may be an object (e.g., a status update, a photo, a location check-in)
hosted by the social-networking system.  At a later time, the social-networking system may push to the mobile client computing device a second notification related to the stateful object.  Instead of all the information related to the stateful object,
the second notification may comprise just incremental state changes related to the stateful object since the first notification. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example network environment 100 associated with a social-networking system.  Network environment 100 includes a user 101, a client system 130, a social-networking system 160, and a third-party system 170 connected to each
other by a network 110.  Although FIG. 1 illustrates a particular arrangement of user 101, client system 130, social-networking system 160, third-party system 170, and network 110, this disclosure contemplates any suitable arrangement of user 101, client
system 130, social-networking system 160, third-party system 170, and network 110.  As an example and not by way of limitation, two or more of client system 130, social-networking system 160, and third-party system 170 may be connected to each other
directly, bypassing network 110.  As another example, two or more of client system 130, social-networking system 160, and third-party system 170 may be physically or logically co-located with each other in whole or in part.  Moreover, although FIG. 1
illustrates a particular number of users 101, client systems 130, social-networking systems 160, third-party systems 170, and networks 110, this disclosure contemplates any suitable number of users 101, client systems 130, social-networking systems 160,
third-party systems 170, and networks 110.  As an example and not by way of limitation, network environment 100 may include multiple users 101, client system 130, social-networking systems 160, third-party systems 170, and networks 110.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, user 101 may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third-party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over
social-networking system 160.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may be a network-addressable computing system hosting an online social network.  Social-networking system 160 may generate, store, receive, and transmit
social-networking data, such as, for example, user-profile data, concept-profile data, social-graph information, or other suitable data related to the online social network.  Social-networking system 160 may be accessed by the other components of network
environment 100 either directly or via network 110.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may include an authorization server that allows users 101 to opt in or opt out of having their actions logged by social-networking system 160 or
shared with other systems (e.g., third-party systems 170), such as, for example, by setting appropriate privacy settings.  In particular embodiments, third-party system 170 may be a network-addressable computing system that can host websites or
applications.  Third-party system 170 may generate, store, receive, and transmit third-party system data, such as, for example and without limitation, web pages, text, images, video, audio, or applications.  Third-party system 170 may be accessed by the
other components of network environment 100 either directly or via network 110.  In particular embodiments, one or more users 101 may use one or more client systems 130 to access, send data to, and receive data from social-networking system 160 or
third-party system 170.  Client system 130 may access social-networking system 160 or third-party system 170 directly, via network 110, or via a third-party system.  As an example and not by way of limitation, client system 130 may access third-party
system 170 via social-networking system 160.  Client system 130 may be any suitable computing device, such as, for example, a personal computer, a laptop computer, a cellular telephone, a smartphone, or a tablet computer.
<br/><br/> This disclosure contemplates any suitable network 110.  As an example and not by way of limitation, one or more portions of network 110 may include an ad hoc network, an intranet, an extranet, a virtual private network (VPN), a local area
network (LAN), a wireless LAN (WLAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless WAN (WWAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a portion of the Internet, a portion of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), a cellular telephone network, or a
combination of two or more of these.  Network 110 may include one or more networks 110.
<br/><br/> Links 150 may connect client system 130, social-networking system 160, and third-party system 170 to communication network 110 or to each other.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable links 150.  In particular embodiments, one or more links
150 include one or more wireline (such as for example Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)), wireless (such as for example Wi-Fi or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)), or optical
(such as for example Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) or Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)) links.  In particular embodiments, one or more links 150 each include an ad hoc network, an intranet, an extranet, a VPN, a LAN, a WLAN, a WAN, a WWAN, a
MAN, a portion of the Internet, a portion of the PSTN, a cellular technology-based network, a satellite communications technology-based network, another link 150, or a combination of two or more such links 150.  Links 150 need not necessarily be the same
throughout network environment 100.  One or more first links 150 may differ in one or more respects from one or more second links 150.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates example social graph 200.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may store one or more social graphs 200 in one or more data stores.  In particular embodiments, social graph 200 may include multiple
nodes--which may include multiple user nodes 202 or multiple concept nodes 204--and multiple edges 206 connecting the nodes.  Example social graph 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 is shown, for didactic purposes, in a two-dimensional visual map representation. 
In particular embodiments, a social-networking system 160, client system 130, or third-party system 170 may access social graph 200 and related social-graph information for suitable applications.  The nodes and edges of social graph 200 may be stored as
data objects, for example, in a data store (such as a social-graph database).  Such a data store may include one or more searchable or queryable indexes of nodes or edges of social graph 200.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may correspond to a user of social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third-party
application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over social-networking system 160.  In particular embodiments, when a user registers for an account with social-networking system 160, social-networking
system 160 may create a user node 202 corresponding to the user, and store the user node 202 in one or more data stores.  Users and user nodes 202 described herein may, where appropriate, refer to registered users and user nodes 202 associated with
registered users.  In addition or as an alternative, users and user nodes 202 described herein may, where appropriate, refer to users that have not registered with social-networking system 160.  In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may be
associated with information provided by a user or information gathered by various systems, including social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may provide his or her name, profile picture, contact information,
birth date, sex, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, or other demographic information.  In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to
information associated with a user.  In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may correspond to one or more web pages.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may correspond to a concept.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a concept may correspond to a place (such as, for example, a movie theater, restaurant, landmark, or city); a website (such
as, for example, a website associated with social-network system 160 or a third-party website associated with a web-application server); an entity (such as, for example, a person, business, group, sports team, or celebrity); a resource (such as, for
example, an audio file, video file, digital photo, text file, structured document, or application) which may be located within social-networking system 160 or on an external server, such as a web-application server; real or intellectual property (such
as, for example, a sculpture, painting, movie, game, song, idea, photograph, or written work); a game; an activity; an idea or theory; another suitable concept; or two or more such concepts.  A concept node 204 may be associated with information of a
concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems, including social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, information of a concept may include a name or a title; one or more images (e.g., an image of the
cover page of a book); a location (e.g., an address or a geographical location); a website (which may be associated with a URL); contact information (e.g., a phone number or an email address); other suitable concept information; or any suitable
combination of such information.  In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node 204.  In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may correspond
to one or more web pages.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a node in social graph 200 may represent or be represented by a webpage (which may be referred to as a "profile page").  Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social-networking system 160.  Profile pages may
also be hosted on third-party websites associated with a third-party server 170.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may
correspond to a particular concept node 204.  Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user node 202 may have a corresponding user-profile page in which the corresponding
user may add content, make declarations, or otherwise express himself or herself.  As another example and not by way of limitation, a concept node 204 may have a corresponding concept-profile page in which one or more users may add content, make
declarations, or express themselves, particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node 204.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may represent a third-party webpage or resource hosted by a third-party system 170.  The third-party webpage or resource may include, among other elements, content, a selectable or other icon, or
other inter-actable object (which may be implemented, for example, in JavaScript, AJAX, or PHP codes) representing an action or activity.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a third-party webpage may include a selectable icon such as "like,"
"check in," "eat," "recommend," or another suitable action or activity.  A user viewing the third-party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons (e.g., "eat"), causing a client system 130 to transmit to social-networking system 160 a
message indicating the user's action.  In response to the message, social-networking system 160 may create an edge (e.g., an "eat" edge) between a user node 202 corresponding to the user and a concept node 204 corresponding to the third-party webpage or
resource and store edge 206 in one or more data stores.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a pair of nodes in social graph 200 may be connected to each other by one or more edges 206.  An edge 206 connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes.  In particular embodiments,
an edge 206 may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a first user may indicate that a second user is a "friend" of the first
user.  In response to this indication, social-networking system 160 may transmit a "friend request" to the second user.  If the second user confirms the "friend request," social-networking system 160 may create an edge 206 connecting the first user's
user node 202 to the second user's user node 202 in social graph 200 and store edge 206 as social-graph information in one or more of data stores 24.  In the example of FIG. 2, social graph 200 includes an edge 206 indicating a friend relation between
user nodes 202 of user "A" and user "B" and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes 202 of user "C" and user "B." Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges 206 with particular attributes connecting particular user
nodes 202, this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges 206 with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes 202.  As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge 206 may represent a friendship, family relationship, business or employment
relationship, fan relationship, follower relationship, visitor relationship, subscriber relationship, superior/subordinate relationship, reciprocal relationship, non-reciprocal relationship, another suitable type of relationship, or two or more such
relationships.  Moreover, although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected, this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected.  Herein, references to users or concepts being connected may, where appropriate, refer
to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph 200 by one or more edges 206.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, an edge 206 between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node 202 toward a concept associated with a concept node 204.  As an
example and not by way of limitation, as illustrated in FIG. 2, a user may "like," "attended," "played," "listened," "cooked," "worked at," or "watched" a concept, each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype.  A concept-profile page
corresponding to a concept node 204 may include, for example, a selectable "check in" icon (such as, for example, a clickable "check in" icon) or a selectable "add to favorites" icon.  Similarly, after a user clicks these icons, social-networking system
160 may create a "favorite" edge or a "check in" edge in response to a user's action corresponding to a respective action.  As another example and not by way of limitation, a user (user "C") may listen to a particular song ("Ramble On") using a
particular application (SPOTIFY, which is an online music application).  In this case, social-networking system 160 may create a "listened" edge 206 and a "used" edge (as illustrated in FIG. 2) between user nodes 202 corresponding to the user and concept
nodes 204 corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application.  Moreover, social-networking system 160 may create a "played" edge 206 (as illustrated in FIG. 2) between concept nodes 204
corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application.  In this case, "played" edge 206 corresponds to an action performed by an external application (SPOTIFY) on an external audio
file (the song "Imagine").  Although this disclosure describes particular edges 206 with particular attributes connecting user nodes 202 and concept nodes 204, this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges 206 with any suitable attributes connecting
user nodes 202 and concept nodes 204.  Moreover, although this disclosure describes edges between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 representing a single relationship, this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node 202 and a concept node 204
representing one or more relationships.  As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge 206 may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept.  Alternatively, another edge 206 may represent each type of relationship (or
multiples of a single relationship) between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 (as illustrated in FIG. 2 between user node 202 for user "E" and concept node 204 for "SPOTIFY").
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may create an edge 206 between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 in social graph 200.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user viewing a concept-profile page (such as, for
example, by using a web browser or a special-purpose application hosted by the user's client system 130) may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node 204 by clicking or selecting a "Like" icon, which may cause the user's
client system 130 to transmit to social-networking system 160 a message indicating the user's liking of the concept associated with the concept-profile page.  In response to the message, social-networking system 160 may create an edge 206 between user
node 202 associated with the user and concept node 204, as illustrated by "like" edge 206 between the user and concept node 204.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may store an edge 206 in one or more data stores.  In particular
embodiments, an edge 206 may be automatically formed by social-networking system 160 in response to a particular user action.  As an example and not by way of limitation, if a first user uploads a picture, watches a movie, or listens to a song, an edge
206 may be formed between user node 202 corresponding to the first user and concept nodes 204 corresponding to those concepts.  Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges 206 in particular manners, this disclosure contemplates forming
any suitable edges 206 in any suitable manner.
<br/><br/> In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the social graph from one node to the other.  A degree of separation between two nodes can be considered a measure of
relatedness between the users or the concepts represented by the two nodes in the social graph
<br/><br/> The social-networking system may provide to a user frequently update content based on recorded activities or actions that may be related to the user.  In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may support a news-feed service.  In
particular embodiments, a news feed may comprise a data format including one or more news-feed stories.  Each news-feed story may include content related to a specific subject matter or topic.  In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may
aggregate activities or actions related to a specific user action into a news-feed story.  For example, a first user may post a photo to the social-networking system, while other users of the social-networking system may perform various activities or
actions related to the photo.  Other users may "like" the photo, post comments related to the photo, or tag one or more particular users to the photo.  The social-networking system may aggregate activities related to the photo into a news-feed story
comprising an image of the photo, a profile picture of the first user, a count of "likes" of the photo by other users, and one or more comments related to the photo.  As for another example, a first user may checks in to a webpage (maintained by the
social-networking system or a third-party system) corresponding to a place (e.g., a landmark, a restaurant, a department store).  Other users of the social-networking system may "like" the check-in activity, or post comments related to the check-in
activity.  The social-networking system may aggregate activities related to the check-in activity into a news-feed story comprising a link and an image of the webpage, a profile picture of the first user, a count of "likes" of the check-in activity by
other users, and one or more comments related to the check-in activity.  The social-networking system may also aggregate into the news-feed story update to the webpage, or advertising related to the webpage (e.g., on-line coupons from a business related
to the webpage).  In particular embodiments, the social-networking may present a news feed including one or more news-feed stories to a viewing user.  For example, an application (e.g., a web browser) hosted by a client device of the viewing user may
retrieve a news feed from the social-networking system and display the news feed in the application's user interface.  The application may display each news-feed story in the news feed in a respective frame (e.g., an HTML iFrame) in the application's
user interface.
<br/><br/> The social-networking system may aggregate activities or actions into news-feed stories based on social-graph information.  For example, the social-networking system may aggregate for a viewing user a news feed including news-feed stories
related to activities or actions performed by users who are within a specified degree of separation (e.g., within two degrees of separation) from the viewing user on the social graph.  The social-networking system may aggregate activities or actions into
news-feed stories based on privacy settings.  For example, a user may specify which other users can access information of a particular activity performed by the user.  The social-networking system may aggregate for a viewing user a news feed including
news-feed stories related to activities accessible to the viewing user.
<br/><br/> The social-networking system may maintain state information of a process, a program, or an object hosted by the social-networking system.  The state information may comprise current or last-known status of a process, a program, or an object. 
That is, an object (or a process, a program) hosted by the social-networking system may be a stateful object as its state information is maintained by the social-networking system.  The social-networking system may maintain and store state information of
an object with a node (or edge) corresponding to the object in a social graph of the social-networking system.  For example, a post (e.g., a status update, a photo, an Universal Resource Locator or URL link, a location check-in) posted to the
social-networking system by a user may be a stateful object.  The social-networking system may maintain state information in access status of the post.  For example, the social-networking system may record whether a particular user has access the post
from a web page hosted by the social-networking system.  For example, the social-networking system may record whether the post has been transmitted to a mobile client computing device of a particular user.
<br/><br/> An object hosted by the social-networking system may comprise user-facing information--i.e., information associated with the object that one or more users of the social-networking system can interact with.  In particular embodiments, the
social-networking system may maintain state information for user-facing information of a stateful object.  For example, an object of a post may comprise user-facing information such as "likes" and comments associated with the post object.  The
social-networking system may maintain state information in "likes" and comments associated with the post.  For example, the social-networking system may record the last count of "likes" and the last count of comments that has been transmitted to a mobile
client computing device of a particular user.  For each of the comments associated with the post, the social-networking system may also record whether the comment has been transmitted to the mobile client computing device of the particular user.
<br/><br/> A web site such as the social-networking system may provide a push notification service to users of the web site.  A notification may be transmitted (pushed) from the web site to a client computing device of a user through a push channel.  FIG.
3 illustrates an example push channel 300 for push notification.  In the example of FIG. 3, a server of a web site 310 may generate a notification for a user.  For example, the server may generate a notification such as a text message in response to
another user's input.  For another example, the server may generate a notification such as a news-feed story based on activities performed by the user's social connections as described earlier.  For example, the notification may be a text message such as
an instant message (IM) or an Short Message Service (SMS) message, an Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) message, an on-line chat message, an email, a news-feed story, an advertisement, or any combinations of those.  The server may transmit the
notification to a channel server 320.  The channel server 320 may maintain for each receiving user a queue of notifications.  The channel server 320 may transmit the notification to a MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) server 330.  The MQTT server 330 may
maintain a persistent connection with the user's mobile client computing device 360.  The persistent connection may comprise a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Internet Protocol (IP) connection.  The MQTT server 330 may transmit the notification to
a carrier network 340.  The carrier network 340 may comprise a local area network, a wide area network, a metropolitan area network, a portion of the Internet, a cellular network, or a combination or two or more or theses.  A push service 350 hosted by
the carrier network may transmit the notification from the carrier network 340 to the user's mobile client computing device 360.  The push service 350 may also be hosted by the web site 310.  For example, the push service 350 may be hosted by the
social-networking system.  Particular embodiments contemplate any suitable entities hosting the push service 350.
<br/><br/> Notifications pushed to the mobile client computing device may be provided for multiple applications for consumption.  For example, a notification may be displayed in a web browser or a messaging application hosted by the mobile client computing
device.  An operating system of the mobile client computing device may also display a notification in a notification area of a home screen shown in a display of the mobile client computing device.  In particular embodiments, upon receiving the
notification, a software application such as an alert controller hosted by the mobile client computing device 360 may determine a display of the notification based on the user's activity at the mobile client computing device 360.  FIGS. 4A and 4B
illustrate examples for displaying a notification on a mobile client computing device.  In the example of FIG. 4A, if the alert controller detects that the user is in a phone call session, the alert controller may cause the notification to be displayed
in a small area 410 on a top portion of a display 361 of the mobile client computing device 360.  If the user is inactive at the mobile client computing device 360, the alert controller may cause the notification to be displayed in a user interface
(e.g., of an instant messaging application) that encompasses an entire area of the display 361, as illustrated in FIG. 4B.  That is, if the user is interacting with the mobile client computing device 360 (or a foreground process is running on the mobile
client computing device 360), the alert controller may cause the notification to be displayed in a minimal, non-intrusive manner.  If the user is inactive with the mobile client computing device 360, the alert controller may cause the notification to be
displayed in a more telling, content-rich manner.
<br/><br/> To provide a lively and interactive experience for a user, it is desirable to push a notification about an activity to the user's client computing device as the activity happens, or as one or more changes related to the activity happen.  For
example, when a user post a status update to the social-networking system, the social-networking system may push a notification to the user's particular friend.  The social-networking system may also push another notification to the particular friend
when another user makes a comment on the status update.  Meanwhile, pushing notifications about the activity and changes related to the activity whenever a change happens can require additional resources in bandwidth of a push channel for the push
notifications.  Particular embodiments describe methods for efficient push notifications.  Particular embodiments may push notifications based on incremental state changes of a stateful object.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates an example method 500 for push notifications.  The example method 500 may be implemented by a mobile client computing device associated with a user.  For example, the example method 500 may be implemented by a process of an
application (or an operating system) running on one or more processors of the mobile client computing device.  The mobile client computing device may be a cellular phone, a smartphone, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, or any suitable mobile
computing device.  The method may begin at step 510.  In particular embodiments, at step 510, the mobile client computing device may receive a first notification through a real-time push service.  For example, the real-time push service may be provided
by a web site such as the social-networking system.  For example, the notification may be pushed to the mobile client computing device by the real-time push service through the push notification channel 300 illustrated in FIG. 3.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the first notification may comprise content and being associated with a stateful object.  In particular embodiments, the stateful object may be hosted by the social-networking system as described earlier.  For example,
the stateful object may be a post such as a photo posted to the social-networking system as described earlier.  The first notification may comprise content associated with the stateful object.  For example, the first notification may comprise a message
(e.g., "Jeff posted a photo") and a payload (e.g., an image file for the photo).  In one embodiment, the first notification may comprise the message only.  For another example, the first notification may comprise a news-feed story about the photo
including a message (e.g., "Jeff posted a photo"), a count of "likes" associated with the photo, a count of comments on the photo, and an image file for the photo.  The news-feed story may also include text strings for one or more comments.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, at step 520, the mobile client computing device may receive a second notification through the real-time push service.  In particular embodiments, the second notification may comprise an update to the content (of the
first notification) based on a state change of the stateful object.  That is, instead of pushing to the mobile client computing device a second notification comprising all the information related to the stateful object, the social-networking system may
push a second notification comprising incremental state changes (related to the stateful object) since the first notification.
<br/><br/> For example, the social-networking system may push to the mobile client computing device notifications associated with a stateful object of a photo posted to the social-networking system.  The photo post object may comprise user-facing
information including a message, an image file for the photo, and a count of 5 "likes" at a first time instance when the a first notification is pushed to the mobile client computing device.  Upon receiving the first notification (including the message,
the image file, and the count of 5 "likes"), the mobile computing device may present in a user interface (e.g., a web browser) a news-feed story including the message, the image file, and the count of 5 "likes", as illustrated in FIG. 6A.  FIG. 6A
illustrates an example news-feed story 601 comprising the message (602), the image (603), and the count of 5 "likes" (604) that are pushed to the mobile client computing device with the first notification.  At a second time instance after the first time
instance, the photo post object may comprise user-facing information including the message, the image file, a count of 12 "likes", a count of one comment, and a text string for the one comment.  That is, the stateful photo post object has state changes
in the number of "like" count, the number of comment count, and a new comment.  Based on the state changes, the social-networking system may transmit to the mobile client computing device a second notification comprising an update including all the
user-facing information that is new at the second time instance (but was not sent to the mobile client computing device at the first time instance): the count of 12 "likes", the count of one comment, and the text string for the one comment.  Upon
receiving the second notification, the mobile client computing device may access locally cached copies of the message and the image file (that were received with the first notification), and present in a user interface a news-feed story including the
message, the image file, the count of 12 "likes", the count of one comment, and the text string for the one comment, as illustrated in FIG. 6B.  FIG. 6B illustrates the news-feed story 601 with content from the second notification.  The news-feed story
601 may comprise the count of 12 "likes" (605), the count of one comment (606), and the text string of the one comment (607) that are pushed to the mobile client computing device with the second notification (i.e., content that are new at the second time
instance).  The news-feed story 601 may also comprise the message 602 and the image 603 that have not been changed since the first notification (and are not part of the second notification).
<br/><br/> In other embodiments, notifications pushed to the mobile client computing device may comprise content including a pre-determined subset of the user-facing information.  For example, the pre-determined subset may include a message, an image file,
and a count of "likes" for the photo post object above.  The social-networking system may transmit to the mobile client computing device a first notification including the message, the image file, and the count of 5 "likes" at the first time instance. 
Accordingly, the social-networking system may transmit to the mobile client computing device a second notification comprising an update including the count of 12 "likes" at the second time instance.  The pre-determined subset may be configured by a
receiving user of the push notifications, or by the social-networking system.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may repeat one or more steps of the method of FIG. 5, where appropriate.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of FIG. 5 as occurring in a particular order, this disclosure
contemplates any suitable steps of the method of FIG. 5 occurring in any suitable order.  Moreover, although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components, devices, or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of FIG. 5, this
disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components, devices, or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of FIG. 5.
<br/><br/> Notifications may be pushed to the mobile client computing device based on priority, a power state of the mobile client computing device, and a network state of the mobile client computing device.  For example, the social-networking system may
assign an immediate, nice-to-have, or low priority to a notification.  For example, a notification may have an immediate priority if the notification is an instant message, a message of a stateful object newly posted to the social-networking system, or
of a category desired or configured by a receiving user.  A notification may have a nice-to-have priority if the notification is an update to a previous notification as described in the example method of FIG. 5.  A notification may have a low priority if
the notification is about a friend updating his or her profile picture stored in the social-networking system.  The mobile client computing device may transmit its power state and network state to the social-networking system periodically or when the
power or network state changes.  For example, the social-networking system may transmit only notifications of the immediate priority to the mobile client computing device if the mobile client computing device has a low power state (e.g., the device's
battery is less than 20 percent of its full capacity) or has a lower-bandwidth network connection (e.g., 2G cellular connection).  For example, the social-networking system may transmit notification of all priorities to the mobile client computing device
if the mobile client computing device has a high power state (e.g., the device's battery is more than 70 percent of its full capacity, or is being charged) or has a higher-bandwidth network connection (e.g., 3G or Wi-Fi wireless connection).
<br/><br/> The push notifications based on incremental state change of a stateful object described above may also be implemented by an example method 700 illustrated in FIG. 7.  The method 700 may begin at step 710.  In particular embodiments, at step 710,
one or more computing devices may send to a mobile client computing device a first notification through a real-time push service.  The real-time push service may comprise the push notification channel 300 illustrated in FIG. 3.  That is, one or more
computing devices (e.g., servers) of the web site 310 may send to a mobile client computing device 360 a first notification through the push notification channel 300.  In particular embodiments, the first notification may comprise content and being
associated with a stateful object.  The stateful object may be hosted by the social-networking system.  For example, the stateful object may be a post such as a photo posted to the social-networking system as described earlier.  The first notification
may comprise a message and an image payload for the photo.  The first notification may comprise a news-feed story about the photo including a message, a count of "likes" associated with the photo, a count of comments on the photo, an image file for the
photo, and text strings for one or more comments.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, at step 720, the one or more computing devices may, in response to a state change of the stateful object, send to the mobile client computing device a second notification through the real-time push service.  The second
notification may comprise an update to the content based on the state change of the stateful object.  Furthermore, the second notification may be configured for display by the mobile client computing device.  For example, in response to one or more new
comments (or "likes") associated with the photo post described above, the one or more computing devices may send to the mobile client computing device a second notification comprising update to user-facing information (or a sub-set of user-facing
information) such as text strings for the new comments and a new count of "likes." The second notification may be configured to cause the mobile client computing device to update a display of a news-feed story associated with the photo post as
illustrated in the examples of FIGS. 6A and 6B.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may repeat one or more steps of the method of FIG. 7, where appropriate.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of FIG. 7 as occurring in a particular order, this disclosure
contemplates any suitable steps of the method of FIG. 7 occurring in any suitable order.  Moreover, although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components, devices, or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of FIG. 7, this
disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components, devices, or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of FIG. 7.
