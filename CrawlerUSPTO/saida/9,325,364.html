</font><br/>
       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A smart phone for using to optimize the energy production of a solar
     panel in real time by a user features a signal processor to receive GPS
     signaling containing information about the global position of the smart
     phone, and input signaling containing control information to initiate a
     GUI algorithm in the signal processor to determine visual and/or audio
     cues for a user on a proper alignment of a solar panel for optimal solar
     energy collection efficiency; and provide display imaging signaling from
     a screen of the smart phone, or audio signaling from a speaker in the
     smart phone containing information about the visual and/or audio cues for
     the user on the proper alignment of the solar panel for optimal solar
     efficiency, so as to enable the user to simultaneously adjust the planar
     orientation of the solar panel having the smart phone placed thereon,
     based on the visual and audio cues.

<br/><br/>Features and Advantages
<br/><br/> In summary, the present invention let's one harness the power of the sun, e.g., including how to maximize the use the sun when installing solar panels.
<br/><br/> The present invention lets one expertly locate, configure, adjust and optimize a solar panel in real-time, anywhere on the globe, using a smart phone's (such as an the iPhone's) assisted GPS, digital compass, digital gyroscope, and forward
facing camera.  It calculates and identifies the highest efficiency placement based on the solar panel's geographic location, orientation, and calendar duration of placement.
<br/><br/> In effect, the present invention leverages the assignee's capability with solar powered water management projects to provide a unique and optimized solution for those addressing water management needs in both developed and emerging markets. 
Further, the present invention provides a clean and easily articulated interface to align the assignee's water harvesting pumping solution.
<br/><br/> Future assignee product innovations, including its upcoming portable solar pumping solutions for rural small-holder farmers, will benefit from the capability to directly optimize solar panels within emerging market rural communities,
unencumbered by charts or additional technical requirements.
<br/><br/> The assignee strongly expects others engaged in rural activities in the global emerging markets to benefit as well.
<br/><br/> Other features and benefits may include the following: Industry leading GUI with visual and audible cues makes the present invention intuitive, interactive and accurate, no manuals needed.  the present invention's algorithms and irradiation
databases don't require a live Internet connection to work, so users in the field aren't tethered by real-time connection constraints.  Celestial calculations may be used visually identify the highest sun path, lowest sun path, optimal sun path and
optimum sun position based upon one's geographic location and selected calendar dates, to provide the most optimal solar panel setting.  the present invention works globally.  By way of example, using the iPhone's forward facing camera, the present
invention's innovative interface identifies potential obstructions to give a trueview from the face of the optimized solar panel.  By way of example, one possible implementation may take the form of: a) Placing the iPhone on the solar panel so the
forward facing camera is imaging upwardly, b) Reviewing the image on the iPhone screen being taken by the forward facing camera looking for potential obstructions, and c) Moving the solar panel so that the image (and the solar panel) has no potential
obstructions.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, a picture could be taken, reviewed for potential obstructions, and the solar panel moved based on that reviewed.
<br/><br/> Since the disclosure for the present invention's solar panel aligning tool appears to be tied closely to the assignee's rain harvesting pumping solution, either of the aforementioned manual (non-electronic) implementations would be appear to
provide a viable technique for further enhancing the underlying technology that the present invention's solar panel aligning tool offers.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, currently the forward facing camera is only used as a point of reference {it mirrors what the front face of the solar panel will see}.  There is not an automated technique for defining obstructions.  However, the capability is built
in to do the following when the forward facing camera is active.  1.  The forward facing camera is relaying the front image real-time {just like when you turn it on to run a video call}; 2.  As noted below, the program overlays images, arrows, and sun
paths to queue the user to define the appropriate alignment; 3.  Once the user has aligned the panel correctly {as noted by the overlayed interface} they have the option to "draw" in any obstructions; 4.  The user simply traces over object which are in
the sun's overlayed flight path; and 5.  The program then debits the power by the % of arc which is hidden.
<br/><br/> The process is not automated.  However, the user can actively select the obstructed areas.
<br/><br/> Other features include the following: "Saved Panels" capability allows for naming, saving, editing, and viewing {using Apple's map utility} of multiple locations and multiple panel configurations with a single interface.  Customizable settings
allow estimations for the expected panel output based upon internal solar irradiation databases, panel specifications, geographical location, and selected calendar dates.  "Power Output" graphs show the power output of the panel for the total time
selected, also for current month and current day Available in at least two languages, e.g., English and German.  Available for iPhone 4, 4s, 5 and iPad 1 and 2, etc. Available free on iTunes as a solution to both assignee's customers and solar
enthusiasts.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, and consistent with that set forth herein, the present invention's solar panel aligning tool may be placed on a solar panel and a program determines an arc of the sun's path based at least partly on the orientation
and known global position on the Solar Panel Aligning Tool using known solar irradiation database, and displays the sun's overlayed flight path on its screen.  The user may optionally trace on the screen over object which are in the sun's overlayed
flight path.  The program may then debit the power by the % of arc of the sun's overlayed flight path which is hidden by the user's tracing.  The present invention's solar panel aligning tool does not determine elevation and azimuth angles of objects in
the captured image and debit the power by the % of arc of the sun's overlayed flight path which is hidden by such objects. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> In summary, FIGS. 1-4, 13 and 14 show embodiments of the present invention in the form of two methods for optimizing a solar panel 12 in real time by a user of a smart phone 20, as well as a smart phone having signal processing functionality for

<br/><br/>FIGS. 1 and 4: The Basic Method
<br/><br/> By way of example, and according to some embodiments, FIGS. 1, 4 and 14 show the present invention in the form of a method for optimizing a solar panel 12 (see also FIG. 13a) in real time by a user of a smart phone 20, based at least partly on

being received by the solar panel 12; 10d, selecting a position from the at least two positions in order to minimize the visual obstructions in the display imaging signaling provided from the forward-facing screen 12b3 of the smart phone 20 that may at

sunlight from being received by the solar panel 12 in the position selected.
<br/><br/>FIG. 2: The Smart Phone 20
<br/><br/> By way of further example, and according to some embodiments, FIGS. 2 4 and 14 show the present invention in the form of a smart phone 20 for using to optimize the energy production of a solar panel in real time by a user featuring: a signal
processor or signal processing module 20a may be configured at least to: receive global positioning satellite (GPS) signaling containing information about the global position of the smart phone 20, and input signaling containing control information to
initiate a graphical user interface algorithm in the signal processor or signal processing module 20a in order to determine visual cues, or audio cues, or both visual and audio cues for a user on a proper alignment of the solar panel 12 for optimal solar
energy collection efficiency; and provide display imaging signaling generated from a screen 12b3 of the smart phone 20, or audio signaling generated from a speaker 20b2 in the smart phone containing information about the visual cues, or the audio cues,
or both the visual and audio cues for the user on the proper alignment of the solar panel 12 for optimal solar efficiency, so as to enable the user to simultaneously adjust the planar orientation of the solar panel 12 having the smart phone placed
thereon, based at least partly on some combination of the visual and audio cues.
<br/><br/>FIG. 3
<br/><br/> By way of still further example, and according to some embodiments, FIGS. 3, 4 and 14 show the present invention in the form of a method for using a smart phone 20 to optimize the energy production of a solar panel 12 in real time by a user,
based at least partly on a computer program algorithm 30 for implementing signal processing having at least the steps of: 30a, receiving in the smart phone 20 global positioning satellite (GPS) signaling containing information about the global position
of the smart phone 20, and input signaling containing control information to initiate an intuitive graphical user interface algorithm in a signal processor or signal processing module 20a in the smart phone 20 in order to determine visual cues, or audio
cues, or both visual and audio cues, for a user on a proper alignment of the solar panel 12 for optimal solar energy collection efficiency; and 30b, providing display imaging signaling generated from the screen 20b3 of the smart phone 20 and audio

so as to enable the user to simultaneously adjust the planar orientation of the solar panel 12 having the smart phone 20 placed thereon, based at least partly on some combination of the visual and audio cues.
<br/><br/>FIGS. 4 and 5
<br/><br/> FIG. 4a shows the solar panel 12 having the smart phone 20, e.g., placed directly thereon, for implementing some embodiments of the present invention; and FIG. 4b shows an image of the Earth with an indication related to how GPS signaling can
determine the global position of the smart phone anywhere on the surface of the Earth.  FIG. 4a includes three solid, dashed and dotted arrow types coded so that the reader can relate text associated with a respective arrow combination corresponding to
the functionality of the smart phone, including direction (solid three arrow combination), vantage point (single dashed arrow) and three dimensional spatial orientation (dotted three arrow combination).
<br/><br/> For example, the smart phone 20 includes the forward-facing camera and associated forward-facing camera functionality in the signal processor 20a for providing the forward-facing camera imaging that identifies the smart phone's vantage point, as
indicated by the single dashed arrow.  By implementing the associated forward-facing camera functionality, the signal processor 20a may identifies the smart phone's vantage point, and provide in the display imaging signaling generated from the screen
20b3 of the smart phone 20 such information in the form of, e.g. camera imaging signals showing the visual obstructions.  Algorithms for implementing a forward-facing camera and its associated forward-facing camera functionality, including in smart
phones, are known in the art, and the scope of the invention is not intended to be limited to any particular type or kind thereof either now known or later developed in the future.
<br/><br/> For example, the smart phone 20 may include a digital compass for implementing associated digital compass functionality in the signal processor 20a for providing the direction the smart phone is pointing in relation to a normal axis, as
indicated by the solid three arrow combination, a first indicating the normal axis, a second indicating the direction the smart phone 20 is pointing in relation to the normal axis, and a third indicating the angle between the direction the smart phone 20
is pointing and the normal axis.  By implementing the associated digital compass functionality, the signal processor 20a may determine the direction the smart phone 20 is pointing, and provide in the display imaging signaling generated from the screen
20b3 of the smart phone 20 such information in the form of, e.g. these three solid arrows as visual cues for the user on the proper alignment of the solar panel 12 for optimal solar energy collection efficiency.  Algorithms for implementing a digital
compass and its associated digital compass functionality, including in smart phones, are known in the art, and the scope of the invention is not intended to be limited to any particular type or kind thereof either now known or later developed in the
future.
<br/><br/> For example, the smart phone 20 may include a digital gyroscope for implementing associated digital gyroscope functionality in the signal processor 20a for providing the spatial orientation of the smart phone 20, e.g., as indicated by the three
dotted arrow combination, a first indicating the X axis, a second indicating the Y axis, and a third indicating the Z axis.  By implementing the associated digital gyroscope functionality, the signal processor 20a may determine the spatial orientation of
the smart phone 20, and provide in the display imaging signaling generated from the screen 20b3 of the smart phone 20 such information in the form of, e.g., these three dotted arrows as visual cues for the user on the proper alignment of the solar panel
12 for optimal solar energy collection efficiency.  Moreover, celestial algorithms may be used to calculate the optimum orientation based upon user inputs to the smart 20 and a selected time period, for a particular global location.  Such celestial
algorithms, as well as algorithms for implementing a digital gyroscope and its associated digital gyroscope functionality, including in smart phones, are known in the art, and the scope of the invention is not intended to be limited to any particular
type or kind thereof either now known or later developed in the future.
<br/><br/> By way of further example, the signal process may be configured to provide associated audio cues that correspond to, or that compliment, the visual cues.  Algorithms for implementing audio commands and its associated audio command functionality,
including in smart phones, are known in the art, and the scope of the invention is not intended to be limited to any particular type or kind thereof either now known or later developed in the future.
<br/><br/> For example, the smart phone 20 may include a GPS signalling receiver for implementing associated GPS functionality in the signal processor 20a for providing the global position of the smart phone 20.  By implementing the associated GPS
functionality, the signal processor 20a may determine the global position of the smart phone 20, and use it in the associated GUI algorithms for determining visual cues for the user on the proper alignment of the solar panel 12 for optimal solar energy
collection efficiency.  GPS signalling receiver, and associated algorithms for implementing GPS functionality, including in smart phones, are known in the art, and the scope of the invention is not intended to be limited to any particular type or kind
thereof either now known or later developed in the future.
<br/><br/> For example, the smart phone 20 may include an intuitive GUI interface (e.g., which may be menu driven consistent with that set forth below) and associated intuitive GUI interface functionality for implementing in the signal processor 20a for
providing the GUI for the user of the smart phone 20.  By implementing the associated intuitive GUI interface functionality, the signal processor 20a may determine the proper alignment of the solar panel 12 for optimal solar energy collection efficiency,
and provide in the display imaging signals visual cues for the user on the proper alignment of the solar panel 12 for optimal solar energy collection efficiency.  Algorithms for implementing GUI functionality, including in smart phones, are known in the
art, and the scope of the invention is not intended to be limited to any particular type or kind thereof either now known or later developed in the future.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 shows the smart phone 20, the solar panel 12 and an orientation level 60, which may be used in conjunction with the present invention.  In FIG. 5, the arrow indicates that the smart phone 20 is to be placed on the solar panel 12.  To aid
global customers of the assignee in solar power panel alignment, the inventors believe that the present invention provides or fields a compelling and innovative smart phone app. The present invention may define proper panel alignment, noting that the
panel is fixed and there is most likely an optimum alignment location {sun's position and travel}.  The present invention leverages the iPhone 4's A-GPS, digital compass, and 3 axis gyroscope.  The present invention provides an innovative and intuitive
graphical user interface
<br/><br/> In effect, combining the smart phone's assisted global position {A-GPS}, direction {digital compass}, and orientation {3 axis gyroscope}, an app may be defined which aids users or customers in establishing the best optimized position {location,
tilt, rotation}, simply by placing the phone on the front face of the panel and visually indicating the correct orientation as the panel is moved.
<br/><br/>FIG. 6: The Main Menu
<br/><br/> By way of example, FIG. 6 shows the "Main" menu screen first, directly after the application or technique set forth herein launches.  This menu screen provides a unique "water effect" containing 6 buttons linked to the application's main
sections.  These six screens are shown, summarized below and highlighted in further detail in sections that follow below:
<br/><br/> 1.  Panels: This menu selection leads to a panels management section, as shown.  In this section, users may create, delete or edit parameters of solar panels.  By way of example, a default set of parameters may exist or be included for some
known applications, e.g., including the assignee's RainPerfect.TM.  water harvesting pumping solution product.
<br/><br/> 2.  Panel setup:--This menu section provides an innovative, interactive and real-time graphical user interface (GUI) for panel orientation.  On this screen, users are guided through the setup for an optimal solar panel position, considering both
local geographical coordinates and a chosen or selected time period.
<br/><br/> 3.  Power output: This menu section provides an estimated power output for a selected panel, location and orientation.  Based upon the specifications input provided by the user for a particular panel, this screen provides estimations for the
amount of power generated by the chosen panel within a particularly selected period of time.
<br/><br/> 4.  About: This menu section provides access to both the assignee's and other social media links.  In particular, this panel may contain information linking to, e.g., the following: EOL Blog, EOL Twitter, EOL <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> EOL LinkedIn, EOL eMail
address, the assignee's YouTube channel, etc.
<br/><br/> 5.  Extras section: This menu section provides a visual access to, e.g., the assignee's news RSS feed.
<br/><br/> 6.  Settings: This section summarizes all user selectable options for the present invention's application.  In this panel, users may input, e.g., their social media (<b><i>Facebook</i></b> and Twitter) credentials, turn sound on or off, and access the
application HELP section, etc.
<br/><br/> The "Main" menu screen in FIG. 6 may form part of the GUI interface, according to some embodiments of the present invention.
<br/><br/> These sections will all be described in further detail below:
<br/><br/>FIG. 7: The Panels Screen
<br/><br/> By way of example, FIG. 7 shows "Panels" management screen that may be used to provide a singular access source, e.g., listing all panels optimized by the present invention's application.  Users may establish specifications and orientations for
as many panel and location combinations as desired.  This page catalogs these multiple entries in an easily accessible and clean interface.  Any of these listed combinations may be viewed, re-optimized, updated, and then saved.
<br/><br/> For example, on the "Panels" management screen, users may access any of the following functions.
<br/><br/> 1.  Create Panel Objects: a) Users may define, name, apply panel specifications, and save multiple panel configurations.  Each configuration may be unique and stored in the application's database.  b) As noted before, customers who have
purchased the assignee's RainPerfect.TM.  water harvesting pumping solution product may select a preset for this system's panel when configuring their location.
<br/><br/> 2.  Edit Object Parameters: a) Users may select any period for defining the optimum panel adjustment.  The adjustment period will define the optimal position for the panel and subsequently define the appropriate power output chart based upon
internal insolation {solar} databases.  By default, the adjustment period may be 1 year.  If a user wants to achieve a better more efficient panel performance, they may choose to optimize based upon a specific day, month, or season.  For instance, if the
assignee's RainPerfect.TM.  product will only be used in a particular geographic region for the spring and summer months, then those particular dates may be selected and the output panel orientation will be optimized for those specific dates.  b) Users
are free to input specific panel specification and performance characteristics.  These inputs relate to panel specifications {e.g., size, efficiency, etc.} and panel performance characteristics {e.g., shading loss, PowerPoint tracking loss, dust loss,
etc.}.  Defaults may already be included in the app based upon the typical characteristics {e.g., specifications and installation} for a commercial 220 W panel.  All defaults are editable.  Note that "Estimated PV power density" may be based upon the
panel's efficiency and the calculated insolation at the point of operation and optimization.  This value will vary based upon the user's geographic location and selected duration.  c) Panel locations may be directly viewed using, e.g., the Apple Mapping
software, included in the current iOS operating system.  Users may click into a specific window which drops their optimized coordinates directly into a map view.
<br/><br/> 3.  Delete Panel a) Particular saved panel configurations may be deleted by simply swiping across the individual entry and then selecting "delete."
<br/><br/> The "Panels" screen in FIG. 7 may form part of the GUI interface, according to some embodiments of the present invention.
<br/><br/>FIG. 8: The Panel Setup Screen
<br/><br/> By way of example, FIG. 8 shows an example of an innovative panel set-up screen and its associated capability of the present invention's application.  For this particular image, one may use the application to adjust the solar panel 12, e.g., for
the assignee's RainPerfect.TM.  water harvesting pumping solution product.
<br/><br/> The "Panel Setup" section is quite simple, graphically rich, and intuitive in operation.  A user simply may place the smart phone 20, e.g., an iPhone, directly on the surface of the panel 12 and start or initiate the functionality of the "Panel
Setup" screen.  The application graphically and audibly, e.g., via a faster increasing tone as one approaches optimum {if selected} informs the user on how to turn and/or tilt the panel 12 to achieve the optimal orientation for the current location and
selected time period (default value of 1 year).
<br/><br/> In operation, and by way of example, the app may take the selected adjustment period and divides it into a sequence of, e.g., 3 hour intervals.  For each sub-period, the app calculates the vector of direction towards the sun.  The summation of
vectors define the sun's trajectory.  Those vectors with Negative Z-coordinates (night time) are omitted.  Next, each vector may be multiply with a weighting-coefficient to accommodate the amount of energy at sunrise/sunset being less than at noon-time. 
Finally, all resulting vectors may be summarized to obtain one "optimum" vector which defines the most efficient orientation point for the chosen period and current location.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 8, the panel set-up screen includes imaging showing compass and bearing gauges 21a, 21b, e.g., displayed on the screen 20b3, containing visual information about compass and bearing readings.
<br/><br/> By way of example, the steps for implementing the aforementioned algorithm may be implemented in the signal processor 20a, e.g. for determining the most efficient orientation point for the chosen period and current location, by one skilled in
the art without undue experimentation.
<br/><br/>FIG. 9: The Power Output Screen
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 shows a "Power Output" screen that draws a monthly energy generation chart 21c for the selected panel, based upon the defined period of time, panel specifications, and local insolation {solar radiation}.  Directly summarized underneath
the panel are the following parameters.
<br/><br/> 1.  Panel input dimensions, width and height: These dimensions may be used to define the amount of solar radiation capturable area.
<br/><br/> 2.  Power: This value is taken directly from the "Panels" specifications and is provided by the panel manufacturer.
<br/><br/> 3.  Efficiency: This value is taken directly from the "Panels" specifications and is provided by the panel manufacturer.
<br/><br/> 4.  Total Output: This value is simply the additive summation of the noted monthly panel outputs in the chart.
<br/><br/> 5.  Average Output: This value is simply the average of the noted monthly panel outputs divided by the average number of solar hours in a day {hours in which the sun is actually shining on the panel}.
<br/><br/> The "Power Output" screen includes a current power selection icon, as shown, for selecting the current panel.
<br/><br/> By way of example, the steps for implementing the aforementioned algorithm may be implemented in the signal processor 20a, e.g. for determining both daily energy generation for the selected panel and the monthly energy generation chart for the
selected panel, by one skilled in the art without undue experimentation.  The display imaging signaling would contain this information and be provided from the screen 20b3.
<br/><br/> In addition, the smart phone 20 may include such power output functionality and one or more associated power output algorithms for implementing in the signal processor 20a for providing the power output signaling and data to generate both the
daily energy generation for the selected panel and the monthly energy generation chart 21c.  Such power output algorithms are known in the art, and the scope of the invention is not intended to be limited to any particular type or kind thereof either now
known or later developed in the future.
<br/><br/>The Power Calculations
<br/><br/> It is commonly understood that the Sun delivers approximately 1370 W/m^2 of energy to the Earth's outer atmosphere.  Consequently, mathematical calculations need to define how much energy will be lost in the atmosphere as one delivers solar
insolation to the earth's surface.  One next considers, at each point of earth, the following:
<br/><br/> 1.  Different day length (hours time at which the panel actually receives sunlight).
<br/><br/> 2.  Different length of path for sun beams to reach the top to surface of the panel {note the graphic below and subsequent graphics}.
<br/><br/> By solving for these variables, one determines the amount of energy delivered to the surface of the solar panel 12.  The theoretical maximum energy is now debited based upon the panel efficiency value provided by the panel manufacturer in their
panel specifications.  The "Panels" specification page {noted in the "Panels" section} provides the capability for additional conservatism in this power measurement by providing additional debiting factors; shadow, dust, etc. to name a few.
<br/><br/> By way of example, formulas are within the public domain and may be located, e.g., at the following internet URL: http://www.brightonwebs.co.uk/energy/solar_earth_sun.htm.
<br/><br/>FIG. 10: The Extras Screen
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 shows an "Extras" panel, e.g., which may provide direct access to the assignee's RSS feed.  As available, thumbnail images are noted next to specific feeds to highlight these particular new releases.
<br/><br/> By way of further example, this section may also provide the capability for users to share the assignee's RSS feed items to their Twitter or <b><i>Facebook</i></b> accounts, further expanding Xylem's social media presence.
<br/><br/>FIG. 11: The Settings Screen
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 shows a "Settings" screen, e.g., which provides a single resource to set globally changeable application inputs.  In particular, this section may be configured, e.g., to allow users to input both their iOS Twitter and <b><i>Facebook</i></b>
credentials, necessary to allow direct access to these social media systems from the application.  The audible alignment functionality may be turned on or off in this section.  The application may allow multi-language capability, e.g., including either
English or German language capability.  This setting is set by the global iPhone language and, per standard iPhone operating characteristics, is not user selectable in the application.
<br/><br/>FIG. 12: The "About" Screen
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 shows the "About" screen, e.g., which provides direct accessibility to the assignee's social media sites.  In particular, the following social media functions are accessible from this screen.  Twitter Handle: @assignee .  <b><i>. . Facebook</i></b>:
Aquatinamics LinkedIn: assignee's Essence of Life The assignee's YouTube Channel The assignee's Blog Essence of Life eMail contact: EssenceOfLife@xyleminc.com
<br/><br/>FIG. 13
<br/><br/> FIG. 13a shows one particular application for the present invention, in which a control box 40 may be arranged in relation to the solar panel 12; FIG. 13b shows a rain barrel 42 having the control box 40 arranged on its top cover and the solar
panel 12 arranged at its base for providing power to the control box 40; and FIG. 13c shows a close-up view of the control box 40 arranged on the rain barrel 42 in FIG. 13b.
<br/><br/> The control box 40 includes a pump and a control circuit (not shown) for pumping water out of the rain barrel 42.  The control box 40 receives power from the solar panel 12 which allows it to operate is locations where electrical power may not
otherwise available.  In such applications, the user may use a smart phone in order to maximize the efficiency of the solar energy collection of the solar panel 12, e.g., using the technology set forth in relation to the present invention.
<br/><br/>FIG. 14
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 includes diagrams of the sun at various angles in relation to the Earth's surface, and mathematical formulas for determining the angle between normal and the sun's beam, which are all known in the art and would be appreciated by one
skilled in the art, and which may be used in determining one or more of the functionality set forth herein.
