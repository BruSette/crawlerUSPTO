content;  selecting a type of content to be captured wherein the type of content is selected from internal content and external content, based on a time period that the user's gesture requesting the mobile terminal to capture at least one content is
maintained for or a number of times that the user's gesture requesting the mobile terminal to capture at least one content is repeated, wherein the user's gesture is a single gesture;  and capturing the selected type of the content and meta data
corresponding to the captured content, wherein the internal content includes content that is reproduced in the mobile terminal based on information related to the internal content, and stored in the mobile terminal, and wherein the external content
includes content that is produced by a source other than the mobile terminal and not stored in the mobile terminal at the time of the capturing.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: obtaining capture data including an image and the meta data corresponding to the captured content;  and displaying the obtained capture data in a predetermined region of the screen.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1, wherein the content comprises at least one from among a still image, a moving image, and sound.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 1, wherein the capturing of the selected type of the content comprises: capturing a plurality of external contents;  and obtaining capture data including an image and the meta data corresponding to each of the plurality
of external contents.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 1, wherein the selecting of a type of content to be captured comprises: capturing the external content when the time period, which the user's gesture requesting the mobile terminal to capture at least one content is
maintained for, is equal to or greater than a predetermined time period, and capturing the internal content when the time period, which the user's gesture requesting the mobile terminal to capture at least one content, is maintained for is less than the
predetermined time period.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 1, wherein the selecting of a type of content to be captured comprises: capturing the external content when the number of times, which the user's gesture requesting the mobile terminal to capture at least one content is
repeated, is equal to or greater than a predetermined number, and capturing the internal content when the number of times, which the user's gesture requesting the mobile terminal to capture at least one content is repeated, is less than the predetermined
number.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 2, further comprising: sensing the user's selection of the displayed capture data;  and providing additional information corresponding to the selected capture data, based on the meta data included in the selected capture
data.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 2, further comprising adding the obtained capture data to a capture panel including a list of capture data.
<br/><br/> 9.  The method of claim 8, further comprising: displaying the obtained capture data in a first region of the screen;  and displaying the capture panel to which the obtained capture data is added, in a second region of the screen.
<br/><br/> 10.  The method of claim 8, wherein the list of capture data included in the capture panel is arranged according to a capture time or content type.
<br/><br/> 11.  The method of claim 2, wherein the meta data comprises at least one from among additional information, link information, and recommended information corresponding to the captured content.
<br/><br/> 12.  The method of claim 2, further comprising: displaying the obtained capture data in a first region of the screen;  and displaying a share panel including a list of identification information of one or more external devices, which are allowed
to share data with the mobile terminal, in a second region of the screen.
<br/><br/> 13.  The method of claim 12, wherein the identification information of the one or more external devices comprises at least one from among user identification information, group identification information, server identification information, and
identifiers of the one or more external devices.
<br/><br/> 14.  The method of claim 12, wherein the share panel comprises a list of telephone directories and a list of Social Network Services (SNSs).
<br/><br/> 15.  The method of claim 12, wherein the list of identification information of the one or more external devices included in the share panel is arranged based on at least one from among a communication time, a number of times that communication

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> The following description with reference to the accompanying drawings is provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of exemplary embodiments of the invention as defined by the claims and their equivalents.  It includes various specific
details to assist in that understanding but these are to be regarded as merely exemplary.  Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various changes and modifications of the embodiments described herein can be made without
departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.  In addition, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions may be omitted for clarity and conciseness.
<br/><br/> The terms and words used in the following description and claims are not limited to the bibliographical meanings, but, are merely used by the inventor to enable a clear and consistent understanding of the invention.  Accordingly, it should be
apparent to those skilled in the art that the following description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention is provided for illustration purpose only and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their
equivalents.
<br/><br/> First, the terms used in the present disclosure will be briefly described below before exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described in greater detail.
<br/><br/> Most of the terms used herein are general terms that have been widely used in the technical art to which the present disclosure pertains.  However, some of the terms used herein may have been created to reflect the intentions of technicians in
this art, precedents, or new technologies.  Also, some of the terms used herein may have been arbitrarily chosen.  In this case, these terms are defined in detail below.  Accordingly, the specific terms used herein should be understood based on the
unique meanings thereof and the whole context of the present disclosure.
<br/><br/> In the present specification, it should be understood that the terms, such as `include` or `have,` etc., are intended to indicate the existence of the features, numbers, steps, actions, components, parts, or combinations thereof disclosed in the
specification, and are not intended to preclude the possibility that one or more other features, numbers, steps, actions, components, parts, or combinations thereof may exist or may be added.  Also, the terms, such as `unit` or `module`, etc., should be
understood as a unit that processes at least one function or operation and that may be embodied in a hardware manner, or a combination of the hardware manner and a software manner.
<br/><br/> It is to be understood that the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.  Thus, for example, reference to "a component surface" includes reference to one or more of such
surfaces.
<br/><br/> Throughout the present specification, the term `object` means anything that a user can select.  Examples of an object may include an icon, a link, a picture, a text, an index item, and so on.  The term `page` means a space containing content,
information, or an object.  For example, a page may be a web page, a list of contents, a list of thumbnails, a tray of photographs, a tray of icons, and so on.
<br/><br/> Throughout the present specification, the term `gesture` means, for example, a movement of a hand of a user to control a mobile terminal Examples of a gesture described herein include tapping, touching and holding, double-tapping, dragging,
panning, flicking, dragging and dropping, and so on.
<br/><br/> The term `tapping` may be understood as a user touching a screen with a finger or a stylus at very high speeds.  In other words, the term `tapping` means a case where a time period between when touch-in is done and when touch-out is done is very
short.  Touch-in means a user touching a screen with a finger or a stylus and touch-out means taking the finger or the stylus off from the screen.
<br/><br/> The term `touching and holding` means a user touching a screen with a finger or a stylus and maintaining the touching for a threshold period of time or longer.  That is, the term `touching and holding` means a case where a time period between
when touch-in is done and when touch-out is done is equal to or greater than the threshold period of time.  If a touch input is maintained for a threshold period of time or longer, a video or audio feedback signal may be provided to the user so that the
user may determine whether the touch input is a tapping operation or a touch-and-hold operation.
<br/><br/> The term `double-tapping` means a user touching a screen twice at high speeds by using a finger or a stylus.
<br/><br/> The term `dragging` means a user touching a point on a screen with a finger or a stylus and moving the finger or the stylus to another point on the screen while maintaining the touching.  Dragging may be done to move an object or perform
panning.
<br/><br/> The term `panning` means performing dragging without selecting an object.  Since no object is selected while panning is done, panning is performed to move a page within a screen or move an object group within a page, rather than to move an
object within a page.
<br/><br/> The term `flicking` means a user performing dragging at high speeds by using a finger or a stylus.  Dragging (or panning) and flicking may be differentiated from each other, based on whether a moving speed of the finger or the stylus is equal to
or greater than a threshold speed.
<br/><br/> The term `dragging and dropping` means a user dragging an object to a desired location on a screen by using a finger or a stylus and then taking the finger or the stylus off from the screen so as to drop the object at a location corresponding to
where the finger or stylus is taken off the screen.
<br/><br/> Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings so that those of ordinary skill in the art can easily accomplish embodiments of the present invention. 
The present invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein.  In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in
detail if it is determined that they would obscure the invention due to unnecessary detail.  Throughout the drawings, whenever the same element reappears in a subsequent drawing, it is denoted by the same reference numeral.
<br/><br/> As used herein, the term "and/or" includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.  Expressions such as "at least one of," when preceding a list of elements, modify the entire list of elements and do not modify
the individual elements of the list.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a mobile terminal according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.  The mobile terminal 100 may be embodied in any of various shapes.  Examples of the mobile terminal 100 may include a mobile phone, a
smartphone, a notebook computer, a digital broadcasting terminal, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a Portable Multimedia Player (PMP), a navigation device, a tablet Personal Computer (PC), and the like.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 1, the mobile terminal 100 may include a sensing unit 110, a capturing unit 120, a memory 130, a user input unit 140, a display unit 150, a communication unit 160, a recommending unit 170, and a controller 180, but the present
invention is not limited thereto.  The mobile terminal 100 may further include other elements or may include only some of the elements illustrated in FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> The elements of the mobile terminal 100 illustrated in FIG. 1 will now be described.
<br/><br/> The sensing unit 110 senses a current state of the mobile terminal 100, e.g., the location of the mobile terminal 100, whether a user touches the mobile terminal 100 or not, the orientation of the mobile terminal 100, and
acceleration/deceleration of the mobile terminal 100, and then generates a sensing signal for controlling an operation of the mobile terminal 100.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the sensing unit 110 may include any of various sensors to sense a touch on or near a touch screen, i.e., a real-touch or a proximity-touch.  A tactile sensor is a type of sensor
that senses a touch on or near a touch screen.  The tactile sensor may sense a touch on a screen to a same degree or more precisely than the degree to which a human being can sense the touch.  The tactile sensor is capable of sensing various information,
e.g., the toughness of a contact surface, the hardness of an object to be touched, and the temperature of a point to be touched.
<br/><br/> A proximity sensor is another example of a sensor that senses a touch near a touch screen.
<br/><br/> The proximity sensor is a sensor that senses the presence of an object, which is accessing or is located near a predetermined detection surface, without any physical contact and by using the force of an electromagnetic field or infrared rays. 
Thus, the proximity sensor has a very long lifetime and may be used for various purposes, compared to the tactile sensor.
<br/><br/> Examples of the proximity sensor include a transmissive photoelectric sensor, a direct reflective photoelectric sensor, a mirror reflective photoelectric sensor, a high-frequency oscillation proximity sensor, an electrostatic capacitive
proximity sensor, a magnetic proximity sensor, an infrared proximity sensor, and so on.
<br/><br/> Thus, the sensing unit 110 may sense a gesture or a pattern input by a user.  For example, the unit 110 may sense a user's gesture, e.g., dragging, flicking, tapping, touching and holding, double-tapping, panning, or sweeping.  In this case, the
sensing unit 110 may sense, for example, a direction, speed, and movement length of a gesture.
<br/><br/> The capturing unit 120 may capture at least one content according to a user's gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture at least one content.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, content may be internal
content or external content.  The internal content means content to be reproduced in the mobile terminal 100, and the external content means content present outside the mobile terminal 100.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, content may be a still image, a moving image, sound, or the like.  Thus, the capturing unit 120 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may include a camera 121
and a microphone 122 to receive an audio signal or a video signal.
<br/><br/> The camera 121 processes an image frame, e.g., a still image or a moving image, which is captured by an image sensor (not shown) in a video telecommunication mode or a shooting mode.  The processed image frame may be displayed on the display
unit 150.
<br/><br/> The image frame processed by the camera 121 may be stored in the memory 130 or may be transmitted to the outside via the communication unit 160.  At least two cameras 121 may be used according to a structure of the mobile terminal 100.
<br/><br/> In a telecommunication mode, a recording mode, or a voice recognition mode, the microphone 122 receives an external audio signal and converts the audio signal into electrical audio data.  The microphone 122 may use any of various noise removal
algorithms to remove noise generated when an external audio signal is input to the microphone 122.
<br/><br/> The capturing unit 120 may obtain capture data including an image and meta data corresponding to at least one content captured via the camera 121 or the microphone 122.  In other words, the capturing unit 120 may collect an image and meta data
corresponding to captured content from the memory 130 or an external server (not shown).
<br/><br/> If captured content is a still image, an image corresponding to the captured content may be the captured content itself.  If captured content is sound, e.g., music, an image corresponding to the captured content may be an image related to the
captured content.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, meta data may include, for example, additional information, recommended information, and link information related to captured content.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the capturing unit 120 may produce an image and meta data corresponding to captured content in one format.  For example, the capturing unit 120 may produce capture data in an
EXchangable image file (Exif) format, an Extensible Metadata Platform from Adobe (XMP) format, or an International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) format.
<br/><br/> The memory 130 may store programs to be processed or controlled by the controller 180, and may store input/output data, e.g., capture data, a phone book, a message, a still image, or a moving picture.
<br/><br/> The memory 130 may include at least one storage medium from among a flash memory type storage medium, a hard disk type storage medium, a multimedia card micro type storage medium, a card type memory, e.g., a Secure Digital (SD) memory or an
eXtreme Digital (XD) memory, a Random Access Memory (RAM), a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), a Read-Only Memory (ROM), an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), a Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM), a magnetic disc, and an
optical disc memory.  Also, the mobile terminal 100 may perform web storage in the Internet, in addition to or as the memory 130.
<br/><br/> The user input unit 140 generates input data for controlling an operation of the mobile terminal 100.  The user input unit 140 may include a keypad, a dome switch, a touch pad, e.g., a constant pressure type/capacitive type touchpad, a jog
wheel, a jog switch, HardWare (H/W) buttons.  In particular, if the touch pad forms a layered structure together with the display unit 150, then the touch pad may be referred to as a touch screen.
<br/><br/> The display unit 150 outputs and displays information processed by the mobile terminal 100.  For example, the display unit 150 may display a User Interface (UI) and/or a Graphical User Interface (GUI) related to capture data captured by the
capturing unit 120, a capture panel including a list of capture data, and a shared panel including a list of IDentification (ID) information of one or more external devices.
<br/><br/> If the display unit 150 and the touch pad form a layered structure together to manufacture a touch screen as described above, the display unit 150 may be used as not only an output device but also an input device.  The display unit 150 may
include at least one from among a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), a Thin Film Transistor-LCD (TFT-LCD), an Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED), a flexible display, and a 3-Dimensional (3D) display.  Also, at least two display units 150 may be used
according to a structure of the mobile terminal 100.  The touch screen may be constructed to sense a location of a touch input, a touched area, and a touched pressure.  Also, the touch screen may be constructed to sense not only a real-touch but also a
proximity touch.
<br/><br/> In the present specification, the term `real-touch` means a case where a pointer actually touches a screen, and the term `proximity-touch` means a case where a pointer does not actually touch a screen but approaches the screen within a
predetermined distance from the screen.  In the present specification, the term `pointer` means a tool for touching a particular location on or near a screen.  Examples of the pointer include a stylus pen and a finger of a user.
<br/><br/> The communication unit 160 may include at least one element for communicating the mobile terminal 100 with an external device 200.  For example, the communication unit 160 may include a broadcast receiving module, a mobile telecommunication
module, a wireless internet module, a wired internet module, a short-range wireless communication module, a location information module, and so on.

<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the external device 200 may be a server device, e.g., an SNS server.
<br/><br/> A method of capturing content by using the elements of the mobile terminal 100 will now be described below in detail with reference to FIG. 2.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method of capturing content, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.  The method of FIG. 2 includes operations that are sequentially performed by the elements of the mobile terminal 100
of FIG. 1.  Thus, although not described here, the above description of the mobile terminal 100 may also be applied to the method of FIG. 2.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the sensing unit 110 may, in operation S210, sense a user's gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture at least one content.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the
present invention, the gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture at least one content means a gesture including a user command regarding content capturing.  The gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture at least one content may be
preset.  Examples of the gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture at least one content may include pressing a capture key, touching or tapping a predetermined region on a screen, shaking the mobile terminal 100, and so on.  The sensing unit
110 may also sense a time period that this gesture is maintained or a number of times that this gesture is repeated.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the capturing unit 120 may, in operation S220 capture at least one content, based on the gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture at least one content.  According to an
exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the capturing unit 120 may determine a type of content to be captured, based on a time period that this gesture is maintained or a number of times that this gesture is repeated.  According to an exemplary
embodiment of the present invention, examples of content may include internal content and external content.
<br/><br/> The internal content means content reproduced in the mobile terminal 100.  Examples of the internal content may include sound content that is being reproduced, e.g., music or voice content; moving picture content that is being reproduced, e.g.,
video content; and displayed still image content, e.g., book content, map content, document content, schedule content, or a web page.
<br/><br/> The external content means content present outside the mobile terminal 100.  Examples of the external content may include sound content, e.g., music or a voice signal that is being reproduced in another device; moving picture content, e.g.,
broadcast content, movie content, or advertisement image content; and still image content, e.g., a name card, a ticket, a book, a movie poster, a wine label, a 1-Dimensional (1D) barcode, a 2-Dimensional (2D) barcode, or a logo.
<br/><br/> A method of determining a type of content to be captured, performed by the capturing unit 120 will now be described below in greater detail with reference to FIG. 3.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a method of selecting a type of content to be captured, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 1 and 3, the sensing unit 110 may, in operation S310, sense a gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture at least one content.  Then, the capturing unit 120 may, in operation S320, determine whether external content
or internal content is to be captured, based on a time period that this gesture is maintained for or a number of times that this gesture is repeated, which is sensed by the sensing unit 110.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the capturing unit 120 may, in operation S330, capture internal content when the time period that this gesture is maintained for is less than a predetermined time period, and may, in
operation S340, capture external content when the time period that this gesture is maintained for is equal to or greater than the predetermined time period.  For example, if the gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture at least one content
is a gesture of pressing a capture key, then external content may be captured when a user presses the capture key for a predetermined time or longer, and internal content may be captured when the user presses the capture key for a time period less than
the predetermined time.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the capture key may mean a hardware input, a predetermined region on a screen, or a predetermined bezel region.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, the capturing unit 120 may capture external content when the time period that this gesture is maintained for is less than the predetermined time period and may capture internal content when the time period that this gesture is
maintained for is equal to or greater than the predetermined time period.
<br/><br/> According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the capturing unit 120 may, in operation S330, capture internal content when the number of times that the gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture is repeated is
less than a predetermined number, and may, in operation S340, capture external content when the number of times is equal to or greater than the predetermined number.  For example, if the gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture at least one
content is a gesture of tapping a predetermined region of the screen, then internal content may be captured when a user taps the predetermined region once and external content may be captured when the user taps the predetermined region twice.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, the capturing unit 120 may capture external content when the number of times that the gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture at least one content is repeated is less than the predetermined number, and may capture
internal content when the number of times is equal to or greater than the predetermined number.
<br/><br/> Referring back to FIG. 2, the capturing unit 120 may, in operation S230, obtain capture data corresponding to the at least one captured content.  In other words, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the capturing unit
120 may collect an image and meta data corresponding to the at least one captured content.  In this case, the capturing unit 120 may collect an image and meta data corresponding to the at least one captured content, from the memory 130 or an external
server (not shown).
<br/><br/> If the at least one captured content is a still image, an image corresponding to the at least one captured content may be the at least one captured content itself.  For example, when the capturing unit 120 captures a web page displayed on the
mobile terminal 100, an image corresponding to the captured web page may be the web page itself.
<br/><br/> If the at least one captured content is sound, e.g., music, an image corresponding to the at least one captured content may be an image related to the at least one captured content.  For example, when the capturing unit 120 captures music
content that is being reproduced in the mobile terminal 100 or at least one external device (not shown), an image corresponding to the captured music content may be a photo of an album jacket, an artist, or music video related to the music content.  If
the capturing unit 120 captures advertisement video, an image corresponding to the advertisement video may be an image of an advertised product.  If the capturing unit 120 captures broadcast video, an image corresponding to the broadcast video may be a
main image of a broadcast program.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, examples of meta data may include additional information, recommended information, and link information related to captured content.  The additional information may include a time
when the content is captured, a place where the content is captured, information related to the content, and so on.  The recommended information means information about content recommended based on a correlation between the captured content and the
recommended content and personal information of a user.  The link information means content access information that allows the mobile terminal 100 to access the captured content.  An example of the link information is a Uniform/Universal Resource Locator
(URL).
<br/><br/> For example, if captured content is music content to be reproduced in an external device, then meta data corresponding to the captured content may include a time when the content is captured, a place where the content is captured, the music
title of the content, information about the artist thereof, other music content of the artist, recommended music content belonging to the same album, and access information about a streaming server that provides music sources.
<br/><br/> If captured content is a book, meta data corresponding to the captured content may include the title of the book, the author thereof, a time when the content is captured, a place where the content is captured, a place where the book is sold, the
address of a web page introducing reviews of the book, and information about another book of the author.
<br/><br/> That is, when the capturing unit 120 transmits a captured content to an external server, the external server may collect meta data matching the captured content and transmit the collected meta data to the capturing unit 120.
<br/><br/> If content captured by the capturing unit 120 is external content, at least two contents may be simultaneously captured.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the capturing unit 120 may simultaneously capture a still
image content and a sound content by using the camera 121 and the microphone 122, respectively.
<br/><br/> For example, when a user captures the label on a bottle of wine at a wine bar where music is being played, the capturing unit 120 may simultaneously capture the wine label and the music.  In this case, the capturing unit 120 produces capture
data for the wine label and capture data for the music.
<br/><br/> The capturing unit 120 may obtain capture data related to the captured wine label, e.g., an image, the name, and the place of origin of the wine, the kind of grape, and an address for accessing a page where the wine can be purchased.  Also, the
capturing unit 120 may obtain capture data related to the captured music, e.g., the title of the music, the artist thereof, an address for accessing a site that provides a sound source, a time when the music is captured, and a place where the music is
captured.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the capturing unit 120 does not simply capture a screen image of content captured but may also capture meta data corresponding to the captured content, e.g., information about a
situation of the mobile terminal 100 when the content is captured, additional information about the content, information related to the content, recommended information, and link information.
<br/><br/> Then, the display unit 150 may, in operation S240, display the capture data in a predetermined region of the screen.  In other words, the display unit 150 may display an image and meta data corresponding to the captured content in the
predetermined region of the screen.
<br/><br/> For example, if Cheom Seong Dae, which is a historic Korean astronomical observatory, is captured, meta data thereof, e.g., an image and description of Cheom Seong Dae, information about a place where it is captured, and information about a time
when it is captured, may be displayed.  If a movie poster is captured, meta data thereof, e.g., an image of the movie poster, the title of the movie shown in the movie poster, the director, the cast, a movie release date, and theaters where the movie is
shown, may be displayed.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the display unit 150 may display capture data in a central region on a screen.  In this case, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the display unit 150 may
display the capture data in a form of cards.
<br/><br/> If a plurality of pieces of capture data are simultaneously captured, the display unit 150 may display all or only one of the plurality of pieces of capture data in a predetermined region on a screen.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the display unit 150 may allow capture data to be automatically displayed in a predetermined region on a screen when the capture data is captured.  In this case, a user may directly
view an image and meta data corresponding to captured content when the content is captured.
<br/><br/> The sensing unit 110 may, in operation S250, sense a user's selection of capture data from among the displayed capture data.  For example, when a user taps the displayed capture data, the sensing unit 110 may sense the user's tapping.
<br/><br/> Then, the controller 180 may, in operation S260, provide detailed information corresponding to the selected capture data, sensed by the sensing unit 110.  The detailed information means information that is more informative than the displayed
image and meta data regarding the at least one content.  Thus, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the providing of the detailed information may include displaying a web page related to the at least one capture data, playing a
music content related to the at least one capture data, or reproducing a moving picture related to the at least one capture data.
<br/><br/> The controller 180 may select an application for providing the detailed information, based on the meta data of the at least one capture data.  For example, if the selected capture data corresponds to music content, the controller 180 may select
an application for reproducing a music file and reproduce the music file.  If the selected capture data corresponds to game content, the controller 180 may execute a game application to provide a corresponding game service.
<br/><br/> Then, the controller 180 may, in operation S270, add the capture data to a capture panel.  The capture panel means a region for storing data captured by the mobile terminal 100.  In the capture panel, a list of capture data may be displayed. 
According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the capture panel may be a type of GUI.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the controller 180 may arrange a list of pieces of capture data included in the capture panel, according to times when the pieces of capture data are respectively captured.  For
example, the controller 180 may arrange capture data corresponding to most recently captured content, in an uppermost region of the capture panel.
<br/><br/> According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the controller 180 may arrange a list of capture data included in a capture panel, based on content type.  For example, the controller 180 may arrange a plurality of pieces of
capture data included in the capture panel in such a manner that the plurality of pieces of capture data may be classified to correspond to still image content, sound content, and moving picture content, respectively.
<br/><br/> Then, the display unit 150 may, in operation S280, display the capture panel to which the capture data is added.  For example, when capture data is obtained, the display unit 150 may display the capture data in a first region of a screen, and
display a capture panel to which the capture data is added, in a second region of the screen.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the display unit 150 may display the entire capture panel or a part of the capture panel in the second region.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a capture panel may include an image and meta data corresponding to each of captured contents.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a capture panel may
additionally display an icon representing the type of content, as will be described below with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating a method of capturing internal content, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 1 and 4, the sensing unit 110 may sense a user's gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture internal content.  An example of this gesture may be pressing of a capture key for a predetermined time or longer.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 4(a), if a song of an artist `IU` is being reproduced in the mobile terminal 100 and an album image of the artist `IU` is displayed on the mobile terminal 100, then the capturing unit 120 may capture a screen image 410
displaying the album image and obtain meta data 420 related to this song from the memory 130 or an external server (not shown).  The meta data 420 may be `Artist: IU, Album name: Real me, Title: You &amp; I, Capture time: 2012.3.1.`.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 4(b), the display unit 150 may display capture data including the screen image 410 and the meta data 420, in a first region of a screen thereof.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the capture data
may be displayed in a central region of the screen in the form of cards.  Thus, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a user may directly view an image and meta data related to captured content.
<br/><br/> Also, when the capture data including the screen image 410 and the meta data 420 is captured, the controller 180 may add the capture data to a capture panel 300.  In this case, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the
capture data that is newly obtained may be added to an uppermost region of the capture panel 300.  Also, the display unit 150 may display the capture panel 300 to which the capture data is added, at an edge region of the screen.
<br/><br/> In other words, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when a user captures internal content, the display unit 150 may display newly produced capture data in a center region of the screen and display the entire capture
panel 300 or a part of the capture panel 300 in an edge region of the screen.  In this case, the user may check whether the newly produced capture data is stored in the capture panel 300.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 4(c), according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the capture panel 300 may display an image and meta data corresponding to the captured content.  In this case, according to an exemplary embodiment of the
present invention, a list of capture data included in the capture panel 300 may be arranged according to time or content type.
<br/><br/> When some of images included in the capture panel 300 are displayed, a user may touch and drag the capture panel 300 in an inward direction of the screen.  Then, the display unit 150 may display all the images included in the capture panel 300. 
According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the user may simultaneously view a plurality of pieces of capture data corresponding to contents captured by the user by using the list of capture data included in the capture panel 300.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating a method of capturing external content, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 1 and 5, the sensing unit 110 may sense a user's gesture requesting external content to be captured.  An example of this gesture may be pressing of a capture key for a predetermined period of time or longer.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 5(a), while looking around a bookstore where music is being played, a user may desire to capture a book.  In this case, the user makes a gesture to capture external content, i.e., the book.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 5(b), the capturing unit 120 captures the external content according to the user's gesture.  In this case, since music is being played in the bookstore, the capturing unit 120 may capture the music together with an image of the
book.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 5(c), the capturing unit 120 may produce first capture data 510 including an image and meta data corresponding to the music, and second capture data 520 including an image and meta data corresponding to the book.  The
controller 180 may add the first capture data 510 and the second capture data 520 to a capture panel 300.  The controller 180 may allow the first capture data 510 and the second capture data 520 to be automatically added to the capture panel 300 when the
first capture data 510 and the second capture data 520 are captured, or may allow the first capture data 510 and the second capture data 520 to be added to the capture panel 300 when the user makes a gesture related thereto.
<br/><br/> The display unit 150 may display at least one of the first capture data 510 and the second capture data 520 in a first region of the screen, and display the capture panel 300 in a second region of the screen.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 5(d), the first capture data 510 and the second capture data 520 captured by the user are stored in the capture panel 300.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, if capture data added to the capture
panel 300 is not desired capture data, the user may remove the capture data from the capture panel 300.
<br/><br/> Referring back to FIG. 2, when the capture data is obtained, the display unit 150 may, in operation S290, display the capture data in the first region of the screen and display a share panel in the second region of the screen.
<br/><br/> The share panel means an integrated communication panel displaying a list of ID information of one or more external devices to share data.  When a user selects ID information of an external device from the list of ID information in the share
panel, the communication unit 160 may communicate with the selected external device.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, ID information of the one or more external devices may include user ID information, group ID information,
and server ID information of the one or more external devices.  Also, the share panel may include a list of telephone number directories and an SNS list.  The SNS list means a list of ID information regarding users registered as acquaintances with an SNS
server, as will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 6 below.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a screen image displaying a share panel when capture data is obtained, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 6(a) and 6(b), upon sensing a user's gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture at least one content, the mobile terminal 100 of FIG. 1 may capture a map image 610 while a map application is executing.  In this
case, the display unit 150 may display the captured map image 610 and meta data 620 related to the captured map image 610 in a first region of the screen, and display a share panel 400 in an edge region of the screen.
<br/><br/> The share panel 400 may include user ID information 400-1, an identifier 400-2, group ID information 400-3, SNS server ID information 400-4, and agent ID information 400-5 of an external device.
<br/><br/> The user ID information 400-1 may include profile images, telephone numbers, and IDs of friends of a user.  The identifier 400-2 may include an image identifying a CE device, such as a smart TV or a table PC, or a device ID thereof.  The group
ID information 400-3 may include at least two pieces of user ID information, a group name, a group image, and the like.
<br/><br/> The SNS server ID information 400-4 may include an image, an access address, and account information of an SNS server.  The term `social networking service (SNS)` means a service allowing a user to build a relationship with unspecified persons
in an online environment.  Users may build new relationships or strengthen the relationships with their acquaintances, via an SNS.
<br/><br/> The controller 180 may arrange a list of ID information of at least one external device included in the share panel 400, based on at least one from among a communication time, a number of times that communication is established, and the
distances between the mobile terminal 100 and the at least one external device.  In other words, the controller 180 may arrange the ID information of the at least one external device, in such a manner that the ID information of an external device that
has most recently communicated with the mobile terminal 100 may be made to appear first or the ID information of an external device that has most often communicated with the mobile terminal 100 may be made to appear first.  Otherwise, the controller 180
may arrange the ID information of the at least one external device in such a manner that an external device most adjacent to the mobile terminal 100 may be made to appear first and an external device farthest from the mobile terminal 100 may be made to
appear last.
<br/><br/> Thus, a user may freely chat with, call, or broadcast information to another user or a user group, e.g., his/her family by using the share panel 400.  Also, the user may directly transmit capture data to a server of an SNS, e.g., <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> or an
external device, e.g., a TV, via the share panel 400.
<br/><br/> For example, referring to FIGS. 6(a) and 6(b), according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a user may capture a map image displaying the location of a restaurant, e.g., Pizza Suprema, and easily transmit the map image 610 and
meta data 620 about Pizza Suprema, e.g., the name and address of the restaurant, information of a map application, a capture time, a place where the map image 610 was captured, etc.) to at least one external device included in the share panel 400.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when capture data is obtained, the display unit 150 may display the capture data, a capture panel 300 to which the capture data is added, and the share panel 400 in first to third
regions of the screen, respectively.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the first region may be located within a predetermined distance from a center of the screen, the second region may be located at a side of the screen, and the third region may be
located at another side of the screen, as will be described below in detail with reference to FIG. 7.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a screen image displaying a capture panel and a share panel when capture data is obtained, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 1 and 7, the capturing unit 120 may capture a displayed map image according to a user's gesture requesting the mobile terminal 100 to capture at least one content, and obtain capture data corresponding to the map image by
collecting meta data related to the map image.
<br/><br/> In this case, the display unit 150 may display the capture data 500 including the map image and the meta data, in a central region of the screen.  The display unit 150 may display the capture panel 300 on a left side of the screen and display
the share panel 400 on a right side of the screen.  However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the locations of the capture data 500, the capture panel 300, and the share panel 400 are not limited.
<br/><br/> A method of allowing a user to transmit capture data by using a share panel will now be described below in more detail with reference to FIG. 8.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 illustrates screen images for sharing capture data, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.  Referring to FIGS. 1 and 8(a), according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, capture data 500 obtained by
the capturing unit 120 may be displayed in a first region of a screen, a share panel 400 may be displayed in a second region of the screen, and a capture panel 300 may be displayed in a third region of the screen.  In this case, a user may drag the
capture data 500 and drop it onto ID information of an external device included in the share panel 400.
<br/><br/> In this case, the sensing unit 110 senses the drag-and-drop gesture performed from the first region to the second region.  Then, the communication unit 160 transmits the capture data 500 to the external device corresponding to the location in
the second region where the capture data 500 is dropped.
<br/><br/> For example, a user A may capture a map image displaying the location of a desired restaurant and transmit the map image to a device of a user B in order to have lunch with the user B. In this case, when the user A captures the map image in the
mobile terminal 100, the capturing unit 120 captures not only the map image but also meta data related to the map image.  Then, the display unit 150 may display capture data including the map image and the meta data in the first region, and display the
share panel 400 including ID information of the user B in the second region.  In this case, when the user A drags the capture data and drops it onto the ID information of the user B in the share panel 400, the communication unit 160 transmits the capture
data to the device of the user B. Since the capture data includes both the map image and the meta data, the user B may execute a map application used to capture data including the map image and the meta data by using the device of the user B.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 8(b), according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when the capture data 500 and the share panel 400 are displayed on the screen, a user may transmit the capture data 500 to at least one external device
included in the share panel 400 by tapping ID information of the at least one external device in the share panel 40.
<br/><br/> For example, when the user A taps the ID information of the user B in the share panel 400, the sensing unit 110 senses the user's tapping gesture, and the communication unit 160 transmits capture data to the device of the user B corresponding to
the sensed gesture.
<br/><br/> A method of providing capture data by using the elements of the mobile terminal 100 of FIG. 1 will now be described below with reference to FIG. 9.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating a method of providing capture data, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> The method of FIG. 9 includes operations that are sequentially performed by the mobile terminal 100 of FIG. 1.  Thus, although not described here, the above description of the mobile terminal 100 may also be applied to the method of FIG. 9.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 9, the sensing unit 110 may, in operation S910, sense a user's gesture requesting a capture panel.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gesture requesting a capture panel means a gesture that
includes a user command regarding a display in the capture panel 300.  The gesture requesting a capture panel may be preset.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gesture requesting a capture panel may include a gesture of flicking a screen from a predetermined location in an edge region of the screen toward the inside of the screen.  The
edge region of the screen may include not only a border region of the screen but also a bezel region of the mobile terminal 100.  In other words, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a user may request the capture panel 300 by
performing flicking toward the inside of the screen from a predetermined location in the edge region or the bezel region.
<br/><br/> According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gesture requesting a capture panel may include touching or tapping a predetermined region on the screen, and shaking the mobile terminal 100 according to a predetermined
pattern.
<br/><br/> Then, the display unit 150 may, in operation 5920, display the capture panel 300 including a list of capture data on the screen, according to the sensed gesture.  In other words, the display unit 150 may display the entire capture panel 300 that
is partially displayed in an edge region of the screen or that is hidden, according to the sensed gesture.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, capture data may include an image and meta data corresponding to content captured using the mobile terminal 100.  That is, the display unit 150 may display the capture panel 300
including a list of images and meta data corresponding to each of captured contents.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, captured content may include at least one from among a still image, a moving picture, and sound.  Also, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, captured
content may be internal content or external content.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the controller 180 may arrange a list of capture data included in the capture panel 300 according to a capture time.  For example, capture data that has most recently been captured
may be arranged in an upper region of the capture panel 300.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the controller 180 may arrange a list of capture data included in the capture panel 300 according to content type.  In other words, the controller 180 may provide a list of capture
data in units of internal contents or external contents.  Otherwise, the controller 180 may provide a list of capture data in units of still images, moving pictures, or sound.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the display unit 150 may display all images included in the capture panel 300 at once according to the user's flicking gesture or may classify and display the images according to a
time period that the user's flicking gesture is maintained, the intensity of flicking, or a number of times of performing flicking.
<br/><br/> For example, the display unit 150 may display a hidden shape or cue of the capture panel 300 when a user's first flicking gesture is sensed, and may display all images included in the capture panel 300 when the user's second flicking gesture is
sensed.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when the sensing unit 110 senses a user's flicking gesture performed toward the inside of the screen from a predetermined location in an edge region of the screen to request a
capture panel, the display unit 150 may display the capture panel 300 to appear from the predetermined location toward the inside of the screen, according to the user's flicking gesture.
<br/><br/> A method of providing captured data included in a capture panel will now be described below in greater detail with reference to FIG. 10.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating a capture panel 300 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 1 and 10(a), the sensing unit 110 may sense a gesture requesting a capture panel while a home screen image is displayed or an application is executing.  For example, a gesture of flicking a left bezel region on the mobile
terminal 100 in a right direction may be set as the gesture requesting a capture panel.  When a user flicks the left bezel region in the right direction with his/her finger, the sensing unit 110 may sense the gesture requesting a capture panel.
<br/><br/> In this case, the display unit 150 displays the capture panel 300 on the screen according to this gesture.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when a user flicks the left bezel region in the right direction, the
capture panel 300 may appear from the left bezel region in the right direction.
<br/><br/> The gesture requesting the capture panel 300 is not limited, and examples of this gesture may include a gesture of flicking the left bezel region in the right direction, a gesture of flicking a right bezel region in a left direction, a gesture
of flicking an upper bezel region downward, and a gesture of flicking a lower bezel region upward.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 10(b), according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a list of capture data may include at least one from among an image 1030 and meta data 1020 corresponding to each of captured contents, and an icon 1010
representing the type of the content.  For example, an icon of capture data related to sound content may be `.DELTA.`, an icon of capture data related to a still image may be `.quadrature.`, and an icon of capture data related to a moving picture may be
`.largecircle.`.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, since a plurality of pieces of capture data may be included in the capture panel 300, a user may scroll the screen upward or downward or touch and drag the screen upward or downward
to view the plurality of pieces of capture data stored in the capture panel 300.
<br/><br/> The gesture requesting a capture panel may include a user's gesture requesting at least one piece of content to be captured.  In other words, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, even though a gesture requesting the
mobile terminal 100 to capture at least one content is sensed, the display unit 150 may display the capture panel 300.  For example, referring to FIG. 7, the display unit 150 may display capture data obtained according to a gesture requesting the mobile
terminal 100 to capture at least one content in a first region of the screen and display the capture panel 300 to which the capture data is added in a second region of the screen.  A method of capturing content according to an exemplary embodiment of the
present invention has been described above with reference to FIG. 2 and thus, will not be repeated here.
<br/><br/> Referring back to FIG. 9, the sensing unit 110 may, in operation 5930, sense a gesture of selecting at least one piece of capture data from the list of capture data included in the capture panel 300.  For example, a user may touch, tap, or sweep
the at least one piece of capture data.
<br/><br/> Then, the controller 180 may provide detailed information corresponding to the at least one of capture data or may switch to a share mode, according to the gesture of selecting the at least one piece of capture data in operation S940.  According
to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when the gesture of selecting the at least one piece of capture data is a first gesture, the controller 180 may, in operation S950, provide detailed information corresponding to the at least one piece
of capture data, based on meta data included in the at least one piece of capture data.  In this case, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the controller 180 may select an application for providing detailed information
corresponding to the at least one piece of capture data, and execute the selected application.
<br/><br/> For example, if a user selects capture data related to music content from the capture panel 300, the controller 180 may reproduce a streaming page related to the music content.  If the user selects capture data related to a schedule from the
capture panel 300, the controller 180 may execute a schedule application.  If the user selects capture data related to movie content from the capture panel 300, the controller 180 may reproduce a movie file.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when the gesture of selecting is a second gesture, the sensing unit 110 may, in operation S960, switch to a share mode to display a share panel for transmitting capture data to an
external device.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the second gesture may be a gesture requesting a share panel.  The gesture requesting a share panel means a gesture requesting the share panel 400 to be displayed so as to
share data with an external device.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gesture requesting a share panel may be preset.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gesture requesting a share panel
may be a gesture of flicking or a gesture of sweeping.
<br/><br/> The display unit 150 may display the share panel 400 including a list of ID information of at least one external device in an edge region of the screen, according to the gesture requesting a share panel.
<br/><br/> For example, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when a user flicks the screen toward the inside of the screen from a predetermined location in an edge region of the screen while the capture panel 300 is displayed, the
display unit 150 may display the share panel 400 in an edge region of the screen.
<br/><br/> In this case, the sensing unit 110 may sense a drag-and-drop gesture performed from a first point on the displayed capture panel 300 to a second point on the displayed share panel 400.  Then, the communication unit 160 may transmit capture data
corresponding to the first point to an external device corresponding to the second point, according to the drag-and-drop gesture.
<br/><br/> According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, if a gesture of sweeping at least one piece of capture data included in a list of capture data included in the displayed capture panel 300 is sensed, then the controller 180 may
switch to the share mode.
<br/><br/> In other words, the display unit 150 may display capture data corresponding to the gesture of sweeping in the first region of the screen, display the share panel 400 in the second region of the screen, and display the capture panel 300 in a
third region of the screen.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the first region may be located within a predetermined distance from the center of the screen, the second region may be located at one side of the screen, and the third region may be
located at another side of the screen, as will be described below in detail with reference to FIG. 11.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating a method of sharing capture data in a capture panel, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 1 and 11(a), the display unit 150 may display a capture panel 300 including a list of capture data on the screen thereof, based on a user's gesture requesting a capture panel.  The list of capture data may include at least one
from among an image 1030 and meta data 1020 corresponding to each of captured contents, and an icon 1010 representing the type of the content.  For example, an icon of capture data related to sound content may be `.DELTA.`, an icon of capture data
related to a still image may be `.quadrature.`, and an icon of capture data related to a moving picture may be `.largecircle.`.
<br/><br/> In this case, the sensing unit 110 may sense the user's gesture of sweeping second capture data (second meta data+a second image).  Here, the sweeping is a type of dragging and means moving from a first point on the screen to a second point on
the screen by a user sweeping the screen with his/her finger or a touch pen without touching any object for a predetermined period of time.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 11(b), when a gesture of sweeping at least one piece of capture data from the list of capture data included in the capture panel 300 is sensed, the display unit 150 may display the second capture data (second meta data+second
image) corresponding to the gesture of sweeping in a central region of the screen, display the capture panel 300 on a left side of the screen, and display the share panel 400 on a right side of the screen.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the sensing unit 110 may sense a gesture of tapping at least one piece of ID information of at least one external device in the share panel 400.  In this case, the communication unit
160 may transmit the second capture data corresponding to the gesture of sweeping to the at least one external device corresponding to the gesture of tapping.
<br/><br/> For example, when a user desires to share second capture data related to map content included in the capture panel 300 with his/her friend X, the user may display the capture panel 300 by flicking a left bezel region on the mobile terminal 100
in a right direction.  Also, the user may sweep a region of the capture panel 300 displaying the second capture data related to the map content.
<br/><br/> In this case, the display unit 150 may display the second capture data related to the map content in a central region of the screen, display the capture panel 300 at a left side of the screen, and display the share panel 400 at a right side of
the screen.  In this case, when the user taps ID information about the friend X included in the share panel 400, the communication unit 160 transmits the second capture data related to the map content to a device of the friend X.
<br/><br/> A method of sharing data between the mobile terminal 100 and an external device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention by using the elements of the mobile terminal 100 will now be described below with reference to FIG. 12.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating a method of sharing data, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> The method of FIG. 12 includes operations that are sequentially performed by the elements of the mobile terminal 100 of FIG. 1.  Thus, although not described here, the above description of the mobile terminal 100 may also be applied to the
method of FIG. 12.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 1 and 12, the sensing unit 110 may, in operation S1210, sense a user's gesture requesting a share panel.  The gesture requesting a share panel means a gesture requesting the share panel 400 of FIG. 7 or 8 to be displayed so as
to share data between the mobile terminal 100 and an external device.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gesture requesting a share panel may be preset.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gesture requesting a share panel may include a gesture of flicking a screen from a predetermined location in an edge region of the screen toward the inside of the screen.  The
edge region of the screen may include not only a border region of the screen but also a bezel region on the mobile terminal 100.  In other words, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a user may request the share panel 400 by
flicking the screen from the predetermined location in the edge region of the screen toward the inside of the screen with his/her finger.
<br/><br/> According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gesture requesting a share panel may include touching or tapping a predetermined region of the screen or shaking the mobile terminal 100 according to a predetermined
pattern.
<br/><br/> The display unit 150 may, in operation S1220, cause the share panel 400, which is hidden at a side of the screen and includes a list of ID information of at least one external device, to appear and be displayed, on a side of the screen,
according to the gesture requesting a share panel.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a thumbnail image corresponding to ID information of at least one external device may be displayed in the share panel 400 in an edge region of the screen.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the controller 180 may arrange the list of ID information of at least one external device included in the share panel 400 according to a communication time.  In other words, the
controller 180 may arrange the ID information of an external device that has most recently communicated with the mobile terminal 100, in an uppermost region of the share panel 400.  In this case, a user may select an external device to share data, based
on a list of recent communications.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the controller 180 may arrange the list of ID information of the at least one external device included in the share panel 400 according to a number of times communication is
established.  In other words, the controller 180 may arrange the ID information of an external device that has most often communicated with a user, in the uppermost region of the share panel 400.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the controller 180 may arrange the list of ID information of the at least one external device included in the share panel 400 according to the distance between the mobile terminal
100 and the at least one external device.  In other words, the controller 180 may scan at least one external device near the mobile terminal 100 according to short-range wireless communication technology, e.g., Bluetooth, and then arrange the ID
information of an external device most adjacent to the mobile terminal 100 in the uppermost region of the share panel 400.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the controller 180 may recommend the ID information of an external device to share data.  If a number of times that a user simultaneously transmits data to his/her friends A, B, and
C is equal to or greater than a predetermined number, then the controller 180 may recommend ID information of the friends B and C by arranging the ID information of the friends B and C in the uppermost region of the share panel 400 even when the user
selects only ID information of the friend A.
<br/><br/> When a user desires to share a music content with an external device, the controller 180 may arrange ID information of friends X, Y, and Z who have shared music contents with the user a predetermined number of times or greater, in the uppermost
region of the share panel 400 so as to recommend the friends X, Y, and Z as persons who will share the music content with the user.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the share panel 400 may appear from a predetermined location on the screen toward the inside of the screen, according to a user's flicking gesture.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the sensing unit 110 may, in operation S1230, sense a gesture requesting detailed information about the share panel 400 displayed at a side of the screen.  According to an exemplary
embodiment of the present invention, the gesture requesting the detailed information may include a gesture of flicking the displayed share panel 400 toward the inside of the screen.
<br/><br/> Then, the display unit 150 may, in operation S1240, expand the share panel 400 toward the inside of the screen to display the detailed information, according to the gesture requesting the detailed information.  In this case, the expanded and
displayed share panel 400 may display detailed information corresponding to ID information of an external device.  The detailed information corresponding to the ID information of the external device may include attribute information about the external
device, information about the relationship between a user and the external device, an image identifying the external device or a user of the external device, and so on.
<br/><br/> That is, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the display unit 150 may display the share panel 400, which simply displays a thumbnail image and the like, in an edge region of the screen when a user's first flicking
gesture is sensed, and may display the share panel 400 including the detailed information corresponding to the ID information of the external device when the user's second flicking gesture is sensed.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a user may request the share panel 400 to be displayed on the mobile terminal 100 while a home screen image is displayed or an application is executing.  In other words, the sensing
unit 110 may sense the user's gesture requesting the share panel 400 while an application is executing.  In this case, while the application is executing, the display unit 150 may display the share panel 400 in an edge region of the screen according to
this gesture.
<br/><br/> In this case, when the user requests the application that is executing to be captured, the capturing unit 120 may capture this application and obtain capture data including an image and meta data corresponding to the application.
<br/><br/> The sensing unit 110 may sense a first gesture of selecting ID information of at least one external device included in the displayed share panel 400.
<br/><br/> The first gesture of selecting the ID information may be a tapping gesture, a touch-and-hold gesture, a double-tapping gesture, or a flicking gesture.  In this case, the communication unit 160 may transmit shared data to the at least one
external device corresponding to the first gesture of selecting the ID information.  The shared data means data that a user desires to share with at least one external device.  An example of the shared data may be capture data.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, ID information of an external device may include at least one from among user ID information, group ID information, server ID information, and an identifier of the external device.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the controller 180 may select an application for transmitting shared data, based on the ID information of the at least one external device corresponding to the first gesture of
selecting the ID information, and then execute the selected application.  The communication unit 160 transmits the shared data to the at least one external device corresponding to the first gesture of selecting the ID information by using the application

requesting a panel.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the panel may include at least one from among a share panel including a list of ID information of at least one external device, a capture panel including a list of capture data, and
a recommending panel including contents to be recommended.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the sensing unit 110 may sense a gesture of tapping a predetermined region of the screen a predetermined number of times or greater, as the gesture requesting a panel.  Furthermore,
the sensing unit 110 may recognize and sense a preset syllable or word as the gesture requesting a panel.
<br/><br/> FIG. 17 is a diagram illustrating a share panel, a capture panel, and a recommending panel, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 17, at least one from among the capture panel 300, the share panel 400, and the recommending panel 600 may be displayed according to a user's gesture requesting a panel.  For example, the capture panel 300 may be displayed when
the user flicks a left bezel region in a right direction, the share panel 400 may be displayed when the user flicks a right bezel region in a left direction, and the recommending panel 600 may be displayed when the user performs double-tapping a lower
part of the mobile terminal 100.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, each of hidden panels may appear from one side of the screen and then be displayed on the screen, according to the user's simple gesture.
<br/><br/> A method of providing a user with information by using a recommending panel will now be described below in detail with reference to FIG. 18.
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 is a flowchart illustrating a method of providing information by using a recommending panel, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> The method of FIG. 18 includes operations that are sequentially performed by the elements of the mobile terminal 100 of FIG. 1.  Thus, although not described here, the above description of the mobile terminal 100 may also be applied to the
method of FIG. 18.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 1 and 18, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the sensing unit 110 may, in operation S1810, sense a gesture requesting content recommendation.  The gesture requesting content recommendation means a
gesture requesting recommended content to be displayed.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gesture requesting content recommendation may be preset.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the
gesture requesting content recommendation may include a gesture requesting a recommending panel.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gesture requesting content recommendation may include a gesture of tapping a predetermined region on the mobile terminal 100 a predetermined number of times or greater.  That is,
the sensing unit 110 may sense a gesture of tapping the predetermined region on the mobile terminal 100 the predetermined number of times or greater as the gesture requesting content recommendation.
<br/><br/> For example, when a user double-taps a bezel region on the mobile terminal 100 so as to be recommended content, the sensing unit 110 senses the user's gesture of double-tapping as the gesture requesting content recommendation.
<br/><br/> According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gesture requesting content recommendation may include a gesture of flicking a predetermined region on a screen toward the inside of the screen.  For example, when the user
flicks a predetermined location in a lower bezel region upward, the sensing unit 110 may determine that the gesture requesting content recommendation occurs.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gesture requesting content
recommendation may include a gesture of shaking the mobile terminal 100 a predetermined number of times or greater.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the sensing unit 110 may sense a pause in the user's voice for a predetermined time or longer during voice recognition.  In this case, the sensing unit 110 may recognize the pause in
the user's voice as the gesture requesting content recommendation.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the sensing unit 110 may recognize and analyze the user's voice to sense a preset word or syllable requesting content recommendation.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the
present invention, the preset word requesting content recommendation may be a word that the user has frequently used when he or she hesitates to speak or is thinking.  For example, the preset word may be `um`, `well`, or the like.
<br/><br/> The preset word requesting content recommendation content may be set by the user or may be automatically set by analyzing the user's language pattern by using the controller 180.
<br/><br/> Then, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the recommending unit 170 may, in operation S1820, determine content to be recommended, based on capture data including an image and meta data corresponding to content captured
by the user.
<br/><br/> In general, the user captures an object (content) which he or she is interested in, and capture data according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes not only an image corresponding to the captured object but also meta data
corresponding to the captured object.  Thus, when content that is to be recommended is determined based on the capture data, the user may be recommended content that is optimal to the user.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, examples of the capture data may include capture data corresponding to internal content reproduced inside the mobile terminal 100, and capture data corresponding to external content
present outside the mobile terminal 100.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the recommending unit 170 may determine content to be recommended, in consideration of at least one from among usage pattern information about the mobile terminal 100, the user's
profile information, the user's life pattern information, and situational information when the gesture requesting content recommendation is sensed.
<br/><br/> The usage pattern information about the mobile terminal 100 may include a communication time, communication details, the contents of messages exchanged, a schedule, a type of a preferred application, a record of visiting a web site, stored music
file information, and the user's preference for, for example, places, a music genre, contents, movies, friends, games, and bookmarked contents.
<br/><br/> The user's life pattern information may include information related to the user's life pattern, e.g., meals, residence, exercises, work, relaxation time, and sleep cycle.  The user's profile information may include the user's age, sex,
occupation, and educational background.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the situational information means information collected by or near the mobile terminal 100 when the gesture requesting content recommendation is sensed.  According to an exemplary
embodiment of the present invention, the situational information may include content that is being reproduced when the gesture requesting content recommendation is sensed, location information of the mobile terminal 100 when the gesture requesting
content recommendation is sensed, time information when the gesture requesting content recommendation is sensed, and weather information when the gesture requesting content recommendation is sensed.
<br/><br/> Then, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the display unit 150 may, in operation S1830, display a recommending panel including the recommended content on the screen.  In this case, according to an exemplary embodiment
of the present invention, the recommending panel may appear upward from the lower bezel region.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the display unit 150 may also display a recommended advertisement.  The recommending unit 170 may extract a recommended advertisement, in consideration of the situational
information, e.g., the location of the mobile terminal 100, time, date, and weather, the capture data, and user log data, as will be described below in detail with reference to FIG. 19.
<br/><br/> FIG. 19 is a diagram illustrating a gesture requesting content recommendation, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIGS. 1 and 19(a), according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a user may double-tap a lower part of the mobile terminal 100 to be recommended content.  In this case, the sensing unit 110 may sense the user's
double-tapping gesture as a gesture requesting content recommendation.
<br/><br/> When the gesture requesting content recommendation is sensed, the recommending unit 170 determines content to be recommended, based on capture data.  For example, it is assumed that the user reproduces music of an artist A in the capture panel
300 of FIG. 17 at least five times per week, capture data about music files of the artist A occupies more than 20% of the entire capture data, and the music files of the artist A occupy 80% of contents that the user has captured in a park.  In this case,
when the user taps the lower part of the mobile terminal 100 in the park, the recommending unit 170 may select content related to music of the artist A as content that is to be recommended.
<br/><br/> As another example, the user may double-tap a bezel region on the mobile terminal 100 when a folder including 2010' family travel photos is displayed.  In this case, the recommending unit 170 may select a 2011' Jeju-do family travel photo folder
related to the displayed photo content as content that is to be recommended.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when during voice recognition, the user says `um (or well)` and temporarily stops speaking since he or she did not know what to say, the sensing unit 110 may recognize either a time
period that the voice recognition is stopped or the word `um (or well)`.
<br/><br/> In this case, if the time period that the voice recognition is stopped exceeds a predetermined time, the sensing unit 110 may sense absence of the user's voice as the gesture requesting content recommendation.  If the word `um (or well)` is
preset as a word requesting content recommendation, the sensing unit 110 may determine the word `um (or well)` sensed during the voice recognition as the gesture requesting content recommendation.
<br/><br/> Since the gesture requesting content recommendation is sensed, the recommending unit 170 selects content to be recommended.  In this case, the recommending unit 170 may further consider information about the user's usual language habits to
predict a word that the user will say, and select content to be recommended, based on the predicted word.
<br/><br/> The content that is to be recommended may include capture data including an image and meta data regarding captured content.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 19(b), the display unit 150 may display a recommending panel including recommended content 1910.  According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the display unit 150 may further display a recommended
advertisement 1920.
<br/><br/> In this case, the sensing unit 110 may sense the user's selection about the displayed recommended content.  Then, the controller 180 controls the selected recommended content to be reproduced.  For example, when the recommended content 1910
displayed in the recommending panel is an image related to music content, the user may reproduce the music content by touching or tapping the image related to the displayed music content.
<br/><br/> FIG. 20 is a diagram illustrating a method of displaying recommended data, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the recommending unit 170 may determine a plurality of contents to be recommended.  In this case, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the display unit 150
of FIG. 1 displays the plurality of recommended contents.
<br/><br/> According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the display unit 150 may simultaneously display the plurality of recommended contents in a recommending panel, or may sequentially display the plurality of recommended contents in
the recommending panel according to a user's gesture.
<br/><br/> For example, when the recommending unit 170 determines first content to be recommended 2010 and a second content to be recommended 2020, the display unit 150 may first display the first content to be recommended 2010 in the recommending panel. 
Then, when the sensing unit 110 senses a gesture of flicking from a first point on the recommending panel to a second point thereon, the display unit 150 may switch from the first content to be recommended 2010 to the second content to be recommended
2020 to display the second content to be recommended 2020 in the recommending panel, based on the gesture of flicking.
<br/><br/> In other words, the user may view the plurality of recommended contents by simply making a gesture of turning pages of a book.  The user may tap desired content to be reproduced while viewing the plurality of recommended contents.  In this case,
the controller 180 controls the recommended content corresponding to the gesture of tapping.  Information about the recommended content that the user selects may be recorded in a user log.
<br/><br/> The above exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be embodied as program commands and may be stored in a non-transitory computer readable recording medium.  The non-transitory computer readable recording medium may store program
commands, data files, data structures, or a combination thereof.  Program commands that may be stored in the non-transitory computer readable recording medium may be specially designed and constructed for aspects of the present invention or may be well
known to those in the computer software field to which the present invention pertains.  Examples of the non-transitory computer readable medium are a magnetic recording medium, e.g., a hard disc, a floppy disc, a magnetic tape, etc.; an optical recording
medium, e.g., a Compact Disc (CD)-Read Only Memory (ROM), a Digital Versatile Disc (DVD), etc.; a magneto-optical medium, e.g., a floptical disk; and a hardware device, e.g., a ROM, a Random Access Memory (RAM), a flash memory, which is constructed to
store and execute program commands.  Examples of a program command include mechanical language code that may be made, for example, by using a compiler, and high-level language code that may be executed in a computer, for example, by using an interpreter.
<br/><br/> While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the
spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.
