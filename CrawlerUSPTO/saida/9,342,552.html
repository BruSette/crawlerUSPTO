FIELD
<br/><br/> The present disclosure generally relates to location-based services, and more specifically relates to graphical user interfaces for map search with respect to location-based services.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A social network, in general, is a social structure made up of entities, such as individuals or organizations, that are connected by one or more types of interdependency or relationships, such as friendship, kinship, common interest, financial
exchange, dislike, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge, or prestige.  In more recent years, social networks have taken advantage of the Internet.  There are social-networking systems existing on the Internet in the form of social-networking websites. 
A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system.
<br/><br/> The social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a user profile, in connection with the user.  The user profile may include a user's demographic information, communication channel information, and personal
interest.  The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user's relationship with other users in the social networking system (e.g., social graph), as well as provide services (e.g., wall-posts, photo-sharing, or instant messaging)
to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system.  A geo-social networking system is a social networking system in which geographic services and capabilities are used to enable additional social interactions.  User-submitted
location data or geo-location techniques (e.g., mobile phone position tracking) can allow a geo-social network to connect and coordinate users with local people or events that match their interests.  For example, users can check-in to a place using a
mobile client application by providing a name of a place (or selecting a place from a pre-established list of places).  The geo-social networking system, among other things, can record information about the user's presence at the place and possibly
provide this information to other users of the geo-social networking system.  The maps graphical user interface can allow the user to obtain location data using a map search with respect to the geo-social networking system.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> The present disclosure generally relates to a location-based services network system, and more specifically relates to graphical user interfaces for map search with respect to the location-based services network system.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a computing device accesses location data representing a first location of a first user wherein the first location corresponds to geographic coordinates, retrieves image data defining a graphical map from a remote
server based on the first location, accesses a search query inputted by the first user, retrieves one or more second locations in response to the search query, where the one or more second locations correspond to geographic coordinates, and displays a
first view comprising a list of the one or more second locations overlaying at least a portion of the graphical map, wherein the graphical map includes indicators for the first location and at least one of the one or more second locations in accordance
with their respective geographic coordinates.
<br/><br/> These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> The present disclosure is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.  In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough
understanding of the present disclosure.  However, the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details.  In other instances, well known process steps and/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to
unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure.  In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described
embodiments.  To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.
<br/><br/> A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it, and with each other through the system.  Typically, to become a registered user of a social networking system, an entity, either human or
non-human, registers for an account with the social networking system.  Thereafter, the registered user may log into the social networking system via an account by providing, for example, a correct login ID or username and password.  As used herein, a
"user" may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.
<br/><br/> When a user registers for an account with a social networking system, the social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a "user profile", in connection with the user.  The user profile may include information
provided by the user and information gathered by various systems, including the social networking system, relating to activities or actions of the user.  For example, the user may provide his name, profile picture, contact information, birth date,
gender, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, and other demographical information to be included in his user profile.  The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user
considers to be his friends.  A list of the user's friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user's profile.  Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction.  For example, if Bob and Joe
are both users and connect with each another, Bob and Joe are each connections of the other.  If, on the other hand, Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam's posted content items, but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob, a one-way connection may be
formed where Sam is Bob's connection, but Bob is not Sam's connection.  Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections (e.g., friends of friends).  Connections may be added
explicitly by a user, for example, the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend, or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users (e.g., users who are alumni of the same educational
institution).  The user may identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user's profile.
<br/><br/> The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user (such as contact information and interests) at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time.  The user may also update his or her profile information at
any time.  For example, when the user moves, or changes a phone number, he may update his contact information.  Additionally, the user's interests may change as time passes, and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time.  A
user's activities on the social networking system, such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system, may also provide information that may be included in the user's profile.  Again, such information may be updated from time to time to
reflect the user's most-recent activities.  Still further, other users or so-called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user's profile.  For example, a contact may add the user as a friend (or
remove the user as a friend).  A contact may also write messages to the user's profile pages--typically known as wall-posts.  A user may also input status messages that get posted to the user's profile page.
<br/><br/> A social network system may maintain social graph information, which can generally model the relationships among groups of individuals, and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds.  A social network
may be represented using a graph structure.  Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network.  Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users.  In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is
defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other.  A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.
<br/><br/> A social networking system may support a variety of applications, such as photo sharing, on-line calendars, search, events, and location-based services.  For example, the social networking system may allow users to post photographs and other
multimedia files to a user's profile, such as in a wall post or in a photo album, both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system.  Social networking system may also allow users to configure events.  For example, a first
user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event, location of the event and other users invited to the event.  The invited users may receive invitations to the event and respond (such as by accepting the invitation or
declining it).  Furthermore, social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar.  Similarly to events, the calendar entries may include times, dates, locations and identities of other users.
<br/><br/> The social networking system may also support a privacy model.  A user may or may not wish to share his information with other users or third-party applications, or a user may wish to share his information only with specific users or third-party
applications.  A user may control whether his information is shared with other users or third-party applications through privacy settings associated with his user profile.  For example, a user may select a privacy setting for each user datum associated
with the user and/or select settings that apply globally or to categories or types of user profile information.  A privacy setting defines, or identifies, the set of entities (e.g., other users, connections of the user, friends of friends, or third party
application) that may have access to the user datum.  The privacy setting may be specified on various levels of granularity, such as by specifying particular entities in the social network (e.g., other users), predefined groups of the user's connections,
a particular type of connections, all of the user's connections, all first-degree connections of the user's connections, the entire social network, or even the entire Internet (e.g., to make the posted content item index-able and searchable on the
Internet).  A user may choose a default privacy setting for all user data that is to be posted.  Additionally, a user may specifically exclude certain entities from viewing a user datum or a particular type of user data.
<br/><br/> Social networking system may maintain a database of information relating to geographic locations or places.  Places may correspond to various physical locations, such as restaurants, bars, train stations, airports and the like.  Some places may
correspond to larger regions that themselves contain places--such as a restaurant or a gate location in an airport.  In one implementation, each place can be maintained as a hub node in a social graph or other data structure maintained by the social
networking system, as described in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 12/763,171, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.  Social networking system may allow users to access information regarding each place using a client application
(e.g., a browser) hosted by a wired or wireless station, such as a laptop, desktop or mobile device.  For example, social networking system may serve web pages (or other structured documents) to users that request information about a place.  In addition
to user profile and place information, the social networking system may track or maintain other information about the user.  For example, the social networking system may support geo-social networking system functionality including one or more
location-based services that record the user's location.  For example, users may access the geo-social networking system using a special-purpose client application hosted by a mobile device of the user (or a web- or network-based application using a
browser client).  The client application may automatically access Global Positioning System (GPS) or other geo-location functions supported by the mobile device and report the user's current location to the geo-social networking system.  In addition, the
client application may support geo-social networking functionality that allows users to check-in at various locations and communicate this location to other users.  A check-in to a given place may occur when a user is physically located at a place and,
using a mobile device, access the geo-social networking system to register the user's presence at the place.  A user may select a place from a list of existing places near to the user's current location or create a new place.  The user may also provide
comments in a text string when checking in to a given place.  The user may also identify one or more other users in connection with a check-in (such as friends of a user) and associate them with the check-in as well.  U.S.  patent application Ser.  No.
12/574,614, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes, describes a system that allows a first user to check-in other users at a given place.  An entry including a comment and a time stamp corresponding to the time the user checked in may
be displayed to other users.  For example, a record of the user's check-in activity may be stored in a database.  Social networking system may select one or more records associated with check-in activities of users at a given place and include such
check-in activity in web pages (or other structured documents) that correspond to a given place.  For example, social networking system may select the check-in activity associated with the friends or other social contacts of a user that requests a page
corresponding to a place.  U.S.  application Ser.  No. 12/858,718, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes, describes an example geo-social networking system that can be used in connection with various embodiments of the present
invention.  The check-in activity may also be displayed on a user profile page and in news feeds provided to users of the social networking system.
<br/><br/> Still further, a special purpose client application hosted on a mobile device of a user may be configured to periodically capture location data of the mobile device and send the location data to social networking system.  In this manner, the
social networking system may track the user's location and provide various recommendations to the user related to places that are proximal to the user's path or that are frequented by the user.  In one implementation, a user may opt in to this
recommendation service, which causes the client application to periodically post location data of the user to the social networking system.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example social networking system.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store user profile data and social graph information in user profile database 101.  In particular embodiments, the social
networking system may store user event data and calendar data in event database 102.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store user privacy policy data in privacy policy database 103.  In particular embodiments, the social
networking system may store geographic and location data in location database 104.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may store media data (e.g., photos, or video clips) in media database 105.  In particular embodiments, databases
101, 102, 103, 104, 105, and 110 may be operably connected to the social networking system's front end 120.  In particular embodiments, the front end 120 may interact with client device 122 through network cloud 121.  Client device 122 is generally a
computer or computing device including functionality for communicating over a computer network (e.g., remotely).  Client device 122 may be a desktop computer, laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), in- or out-of-car navigation system, smart
phone or other cellular or mobile phone, or mobile gaming device, among other suitable computing devices.  Client device 122 may execute one or more client applications, such as a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox,
Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera, etc.), to access and view content over a computer network.  Front end 120 may include web or HTTP server functionality, as well as other functionality, to allow users to access the social networking system. 
Network cloud 121 generally represents a network or collection of networks (such as the Internet or a corporate intranet, or a combination of both) over which client devices 122 may access the social network system.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, user profile database 101 may store communication channel information and an address book of a user.  The address book, in one implementation, may be a superset or a subset of the users of the social networking system
that a user has established a friend or contact relationship.  A user of client device 122 may access this address book information using a special purpose or general purpose client application to view contact information.  In particular embodiments, the
address book may contain one or more contacts (e.g. a person or an business entity), and a name (e.g., first name, and/or last name) and communication channel information for each contact (e.g., a phone number, a user ID for an IM service, an email
address, a user ID for a social networking system, home address, etc.).  For at least a portion of the address book information, the contact entries may be dynamic in that the contact entry is associated with a user of the social networking system that
maintains his or her own account and corresponding user profile with contact information.  Accordingly, when a first user changes any aspect of contact information, the revised contact information may be provided to requesting users.  In particular
embodiments, a user may access the address book, look up and connect to a contact through a communication channel.  In some implementations, the client device 122 may maintain a local copy of the address book that may be refreshed or synchronized at
various times.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, event database 102 may store event data for any number of particular events and the data associated with each event including the name of the event, the date and time of the event, the event location, particular users
who are invited to participate or who are participating in the event, and other user or participant's comments about the event.  For example, a user may schedule an event through the social networking system, which has an associated link so that any
invited user may participate, or any user if the event is open to any user.  The event may have a specific geographical location associated with the event and other participants who have indicated through the social networking system that they will
participate in the event.  The event may also have event photos that have been uploaded by the user who created the event or any other participants.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, privacy policy database 103 may store a user's privacy data for a user's settings for each user datum associated with the user and the user's settings for third party applications.  For example, a user may have
selected default privacy settings or a user may have specifically excluded certain entities from viewing a user datum or particular type of user data, and all of that privacy data for all users and friends of users may be stored in the privacy policy
database 103.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store geo-location data identifying a real-world geographic location of a user associated with a check-in. For example, a geographic location of an Internet connected computer can be
identified by the computer's IP address.  For example, a geographic location of a cell phone equipped with Wi-Fi and GPS capabilities can be identified by cell tower triangulation, Wi-Fi positioning, and/or GPS positioning.  In particular embodiments,
location database 104 may store an information base of places, where each place includes a name, a geographic location and meta information.  For example, a place can be a local business, a point of interest (e.g., Union Square in San Francisco, Calif.),
a college, a city, or a national park.  For example, a geographic location of a place (e.g., a local coffee shop) can be an address, a set of geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), or a reference to another place (e.g., "the coffee shop next to
the train station").  For example, a geographic location of a place with a large area (e.g., Yosemite National Park) can be a shape (e.g., a circle, or a polygon) approximating the boundary of the place and/or a centroid (i.e., geometric center) of the
shape.  For example, meta information of a place can include information identifying be the user that initially created the place, reviews, ratings, comments, check-in activity data, and the like.  Places may be created by administrators of the system
and/or created by users of the system.  For example, a user may register a new place by accessing a client application to define a place name and provide a geographic location and cause the newly created place to be registered in location database 104. 
The creating user or other users may access a web page directed to the page and add additional information, such as reviews, comments and ratings for the place.  In particular embodiments, location database 104 may store a user's location data.  For
example, location database 104 may store a user's check-in activities.  For example, a user can create a place (e.g., a new restaurant or coffee shop), causing the social networking system to stores the user-created place in location database 104.  For
example, a user can create a comment, a review, or a rating of a place, causing the social networking system to store the user's comment, review and rating of the place in location database 104.
<br/><br/> The social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities.  In particular embodiments, a user of the social networking system may upload one or more media files to media database 105.  For example, a user can upload a photo or a
set of photos (often called a photo album), or a video clip to media database 105 from a client device 122 (e.g., a computer, or a camera phone).  In particular embodiments, the one or more media files may contain metadata (often called "tags")
associated with each media file.  For example, a photo shot by a digital camera may contain metadata relating to file size, resolution, time stamp, name of the camera maker, and/or location (e.g., GPS) coordinates.  A user can add additional metadata
values to a photo, or tag a photo, during an upload process.  Some examples of tags of a media file are author, title, comments, event names, time, location, names of people appearing in the media file, or user comment.  In particular embodiments, a user
may tag a media file by using a client application (e.g., a photo or video editor), or entering one or more tags in a graphical user interface of a media uploading tool that uploads a user's one or more media files from a client device 122 to the social
networking system.  A user may also tag a media file after an upload at a later time in the social networking system's web site.  In particular embodiments, the social networking system may also extract metadata from a media file and store the metadata
in media database 105.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, news feed engine 110 may access user profile database 101, event database 102, location database 104 and media database 105 for data about a user or set of users of the social networking system, and assemble a list of
one or more activities as news items for a particular user.  In particular embodiments, news feed engine 110 may access privacy policy database 103 and determine a subset of news items based on one or more privacy settings.  In particular embodiments,
news feed engine 110 may compile a dynamic list of a limited number of news items in a ranked or sorted order.  In particular embodiments, news feed engine 110 may provide links related to one or more activities in the news items, and links providing
opportunities to participate in the activities.  For example, a news feed can comprise wall posts, status updates, comments, and recent check-ins to a place (with a link to a web page of the place).  In other embodiments, news feed engine 110 may access
user profile database 101, event database 102, location database 104 and media database 105 and compile a dynamic list of a limited number of news items about a group of related actions received from users of the social networking system (i.e., a news
feed).  For example, a news feed can comprise an event that a user may schedule and organize through the social networking system (with a link to participate the event), check-ins at a specific geographical location of the event by the user and other
participants of the event, messages about the event posted by the user and other participants of the event, and photos of the event uploaded by the user and other participants of the event.
<br/><br/> The social networking system may also support other location-based services, such as location-based search and map services.  For example, using client device 122, a user may access the social networking system and retrieve graphical maps that
correspond to the user's current location and/or a desired location.  In particular embodiments, a user may manually input a location either in a free-form text field and/or in connection with a check-in to a place in a geo-social networking system. 
Still further, the client device 122 may include GPS or other location functionality that may be appended or otherwise included in one or more messages transmitted to the social networking system.  The social networking system itself may host search and
map services as internal functionality or may rely on one or more external systems hosted by third party service providers.  Using such functionality, a user may transmit a query that identifies a location and, optionally, one or more search terms that
correspond to a desired activity or other intention (such as restaurants, shopping, gas stations and the like).  A response may include a graphical map indicating the identified location graphically as an icon together with additional icons corresponding
to locations that meet the search query.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an example method of displaying a graphical user interface for a map search with respect to the location-based services networking system.  In particular embodiments, graphical map search data may be displayed in one or more
user interfaces, e.g., example user interfaces illustrated in FIG. 3-FIG. 6.  The steps in FIG. 2 may be executed by a user interacting with the interface of client device 122.  Client device 122 may access the location-based map search services using
either a special-purpose client application or a general-purpose browser client.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may access location data representing a first location of a first user wherein the first location corresponds to geographic coordinates, as illustrated in step 210.  The first location may be a current location or previous
location of the user or any arbitrary location specified by the user.  The first location may be a location identified as the result of a query.  Particular embodiments may automatically access GPS data or other geo-location functions to determine a
location of the user.  Particular embodiments may determine the user's location based on location data from social networking system being continuously received by a special purpose client application that is configured to continuously capture location
data of a mobile device of the first user.  Particular embodiments may record data, including but not limited to, the latitude and longitude of the user, the altitude of the user, the horizontal and vertical accuracy levels of the location information,
the current speed and direction of the user's travel, the timestamp of when a particular location was recorded, and the source of the location data on the mobile device, for example, from a GPS chip, WiFi, Bluetooth hardware, Cellular ID, or a software
solution incorporating one or more of the above signals.  Particular embodiments may determine the first user's location based on the user's most recent or history of location information, based on the entries above in the geo-social networking system. 
Particular embodiments may determine the first user's location based on automatic check-in or geo-tracking mechanisms or even the user's latest check-in entry based on the time stamp of the entry maintained by a geo-social networking system. 
Furthermore, location information may also be included in a search query inputted by the user in a text entry field.  For example, a user may input a query "coffee Dolores Park." A search service may parse the query to identify the geographic terms to
locate map image data to be displayed to a user.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the search query may require disambiguation based on a variety of signals, including but not limited to, the most recent or history of location information for the user stored in the geo-social networking system,
recent or historical location information for friends of the user as determined by the geo-social networking system, the currently displayed viewport of the graphical map interface, or location information resident on the mobile device but not yet
resident on the geo-social networking system.  In particular embodiments, for example, Dolores Park could refer to a park in San Francisco or New York, or two completely different zones.  In particular embodiments, which set of results is retrieved could
be altered by whether the user is closer to one of the two zones, whether they are normally closer to one of the two zones, whether the user's friends are normally closer to one of the two zones, and whether the phone has received a GPS update saying
that the phone is closer to one of the two zones even if the geo-social networking system has not yet been updated.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may retrieve image data defining a graphical map from a remote server based on the first location, as illustrated in step 220.  In particular embodiments, image data defining a graphical map may be retrieved from local
cache of the client.  Image data defining a graphical map may be stored in databases, servers, other types of computing devices, or in the local cache of the client.  FIG. 3 illustrates an example user interface where image data defining a graphical map
has been retrieved from a remote server based on the first location and is being displayed as a graphical map 300.  Within graphical map 300, location data representing a first location of a first user may be displayed as graphical location indicator
310.  For example, graphical location indicator 310 representing the current location of the first user may be a blue dot, or any other such graphical indicator that distinctly points out the location of the user.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may access a search query inputted by the first user, as illustrated in step 230.  Particular embodiments of graphical map 300 may have an input field 320 contained in the interface where the user can enter a search query. A search query is a query that a user enters into input field 320 to satisfy his or her informational needs.  For example, a user may enter a search query for "coffee" into input field 320.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may retrieve one or more second locations in response to the search query, where the one or more second locations correspond to geographic coordinates, as illustrated in step 240.  Sophisticated search engines implement
many other functionalities in addition to merely identifying the second locations as a part of the search process.  For example, a search engine may rank the second locations identified for a search query according to their relative degrees of relevance. Relevance may include one or more of a proximity component and one or more social components.  For example, relevance of a particular second location may be based in part on the distance between the first location and the second location.  In order to
determine relevance to the user at the first location, particular embodiments may access the user's social network data.  For example, particular embodiments may access data associated the user's prior check-in activity.  Particular embodiments may
access data associated with the other users who have checked-in, which may include the user's friends or other social contacts of the user who is at the first location.  Particular embodiments may access data associated with places that the first user
"likes" or additional "like" data from any other users including, but not limited to, the user's friends or other social contacts of the user.  In particular embodiments, the first user or any other user may have "liked" any of one or more second
location one or more times.  Further, particular embodiments may access external data, such as third-party ratings and reviews.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a search engine may rank the second locations identified for a search query by relevance and relative to the user's location so that second locations in closer proximity to the user are ranked higher than those second
locations that are a greater distance from the user.  In order to determine the relevance and proximity, particular embodiments may access the social network data discussed above as well as location data of the user that was accessed in step 210.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may display a first view comprising a list of the one or more second locations overlaying at least a portion of the graphical map, wherein the graphical map includes indicators for the first location and at least one of
the one or more second locations in accordance with their respective geographic coordinates, as illustrated in step 250.  In particular embodiments, the list of one or more second locations overlaying at least a portion of the graphical map is
translucent, enabling the graphical map to be at least slightly visible through the list.  FIG. 4 illustrates an example search result 400 that identifies four second locations 410, 420, 430, 440.  Search result 400 is generated in response to an example
search query "coffee".  Note that only four second locations are illustrated in order to simplify the discussion.  In practice, a search result may identify tens, hundreds, or even thousands of locations near or around the first user.  Still further, the
overlay list view may be scrollable to allow additional locations to be displayed.  Second locations 410, 420, 430, 440, each may include a title for the location, a short summary, including relevant social data retrieved from social networking system,
and a rating for the particular second location.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, second locations 410, 420, 430, 440, may be presented according to their relative degrees of relevance to search query "coffee".  That is, second location 410 may be considered somewhat more relevant to search query
"coffee" than second location 420, which, in turn, may be considered somewhat more relevant than second location 430, and so on.  Consequently, second location 410 may be presented first (i.e., at the top of search result 400) followed by second location
420, second location 430, and so on.  In particular embodiments, second locations 410, 420, 430, 440 may be presented in a list view on top of the map that obscures at least a portion of the map.  In some embodiments, the graphical map icon or location
indicator corresponding to the first-ranked location may be centered in the portion of the display map that remains unobscured by the list view.  Furthermore, the client application may move the displayed portion of the map such that another icon
corresponding to a location in the list view is substantially centered in the unobscured portion in response to selection inputs by the user.  For example, positional indicator 401 may correspond to second location 410.  In other particular embodiments,
in response to selection inputs by the user, the client application may collapse the list view such that the map is completely unobscured by the list and re-enable the list view, which may again obscure at least a portion of the map.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, 410, 420, 430, 440, may be presented according to their relative degrees of relevance to search query "coffee" in or around the user's location.  That is, second location 410 may be considered somewhat more relevant to
search query "coffee" and closer in proximity to the user's current location than second location 420.  Second location 420, in turn, is considered somewhat more relevant and close in proximity to the user's location than second location 430, and so on. 
Consequently, second location 410 may be presented first (i.e., at the top of search result 400) followed by second location 420, second location 430, and so on.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the ranking of the second locations with respect to the search queries may be determined by a ranking algorithm implemented by the search engine.  Given a search query and a set of second locations identified in
response to the search query, the ranking algorithm ranks the second locations in the set according to their relative degrees of relevance with respect to the search query or by proximity to the first user.  More specifically, in particular embodiments,
the second locations that are relatively more relevant to the search query are ranked higher than the second locations that are relatively less relevant to the search query, as illustrated, for example, in FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> As discussed above, second locations 410, 420, 430, 440 may also be represented as corresponding positional indicators in the graphical map portion of the user interface.  Each positional indicator appearing on the graphical map portion of the
user interface may represent a corresponding second location 410, 420, 430, 440, and appear at the geographical coordinates for the location associated with second locations 410, 420, 430, 440.  As discussed below, a list view may be displayed as an
overlay on the graphical map that can be toggled on and off by the user.  Furthermore, a user using appropriate inputs (such as touch screen inputs) may cause the client application (with the overlay list toggled on or off) to pan the graphical map as
desired by the user.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, each second location 410, 420, 430, and 440 is selectable both in the overlaying list view and the graphical map.  Particular embodiments may, in response to input by the first user, display a second view comprising
the list of the one or more second locations overlaying the graphical map, wherein one of the one or more second locations is highlighted and the portion of the displayed may that is unobscured by the overlaying list view is centered on the geographic
coordinates of the highlighted second location.  For example, in particular embodiments, if the user selects a second location 410, 420, 430, 440 from the list view, the second location may become highlighted and the graphical map may center on the
positional icon representing the geographic coordinates for the selected second location.  Further, in response to input by the first user from the graphical map view, particular embodiments may display a third view comprising the list of the one or more
second locations overlaying the graphical map, wherein one of the one or more second locations is highlighted and the unobscured (in one implementation, lower) portion of the map is centered and zoomed in on the geographic coordinates of the highlighted
second location.  In other implementations, in particular embodiments, if the user selects a second location 410, 420, 430, 440 (either the from the list or the graphical map), the second location may become highlighted and the graphical map may center
relative to the overall graphical map (including the obscured portion) and zoom in on the positional icon representing the geographic coordinates for the selected second location.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, in response to input by the first user associated with a particular second location 410, 420, 430, 440, a client application may display further information about the selected second location, as illustrated in FIG. 5. FIG. 5 illustrates a user interface where in response to input by the user, meta-information is displayed for a second location in user interface 500.  For example, the user has selected second location 410, or "Blue Bottle Coffee".  User interface 500
is partitioned into several areas or components.  In particular embodiments, one or more components in user interface 500, e.g., component 510, may be used to display relevant location data about the selected second location 410.  For example, component
510 may display the geographical coordinates, address, phone number, or business hours for the selected second location 410.  In particular embodiments, additional components, such as component 520, may be used to display social network data retrieved
from social networking system that relates to selected second location 410.  For example, component 520 may display social network data such as friends or other associates of the user who have checked-in at Blue Bottle Coffee, commented on Blue Bottle
Coffee, indicated that they "like" Blue Bottle Coffee, or any other social network data available in the database.  In particular embodiments, additional components, such as component 530, may be used to display selectable components where the component
