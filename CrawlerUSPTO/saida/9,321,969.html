       <p> A computer-implemented method for enabling users of social-networking
     applications to interact using virtual personas may include (1) creating
     a social-networking identity associated with a user of a
     social-networking application, (2) creating a plurality of virtual
     personas that represent different real-life roles of the user as part of
     the user's social-networking identity, (3) receiving a request to perform
     at least one networking action that implicates at least one of the user's
     virtual personas, and then (4) directing the social-networking
     application to perform the networking action such that the networking
     action implicates the user's virtual persona without implicating the
     user's entire social-networking identity. Various other methods, systems,
     and computer-readable media are also disclosed.

determining, based at least in part on the analysis of the user's request, that the user has selected the first virtual persona to be associated with the other user.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 1, wherein directing the social-networking application to establish the social-networking application comprises: obtaining the other user's consent to establish the social-networking relationship;  in response to
obtaining the other user's consent, directing the social-networking application to establish the social-networking relationship.
<br/><br/> 9.  The method of claim 1, wherein directing the social-networking application to establish the social-networking application comprises establishing the social-networking relationship such that the social-networking relationship implicates the
first virtual persona without implicating the second virtual persona.
<br/><br/> 10.  The method of claim 1, wherein the creating, receiving, and directing steps are performed by a plug-in that interfaces with the social-networking application.
<br/><br/> 11.  The method of claim 1, wherein directing the social-networking application to establish the social-networking application comprises transmitting, to at least one other user of the social-networking application, a message that includes a
link to at least one content instance associated with the first virtual persona.
<br/><br/> 12.  The method of claim 1, wherein directing the social-networking application to establish the social-networking application comprises transmitting a message that includes at least one content instance associated with the first virtual persona
to the other user of the social-networking application.
<br/><br/> 13.  The method of claim 1, wherein directing the social-networking application to establish the social-networking application comprises sharing, with the other user of the social-networking application, at least one content instance associated
with the first virtual persona.
<br/><br/> 14.  The method of claim 1, wherein directing the social-networking application to establish the social-networking application comprises associating at least one content instance previously shared via the social-networking application with the
first virtual persona.
<br/><br/> 15.  The method of claim 1, wherein: the first virtual persona comprises a virtual persona that represents the user's role as a romantic-relationship seeker;  receiving a request to establish the social-networking relationship comprises
receiving a request to establish a social-networking relationship between the user's virtual persona that represents the user's role as a romantic-relationship seeker and the other user of the social-networking application;  directing the

persona and a second geo-location associated with the second virtual persona;  upon defining the first and second geo-locations: enables the user to share, under the first virtual persona, at least one content instance that identifies the user's location
while the user is located at the first geo-location;  prevents the user from sharing, under the second virtual persona, the content instance that identifies the user's location while the user is located at the first geo-location due at least in part to
the first geo-location being associated with the first virtual persona and not being associated with the second virtual persona;  directs the social-networking application to associate at least one photograph previously shared via the social-networking
application with the first virtual persona by: enabling the user to assume the first virtual persona within the social-networking application;  after the user has assumed the first virtual persona: identifying a tag request submitted by the user to tag
the user in the photograph previously shared via the social-networking application;  ensuring that the user's tag in the photograph is associated with the first virtual persona and not associated with the second virtual persona due at least in part to
the user having assumed the first virtual persona prior to submitting the tag request. <hr/> <center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> In recent years, the popularity of social-networking applications (such as <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> TWITTER, and LINKEDIN) has increased dramatically among technology users.  Some social-networking applications allow users to create profiles that enable the
users to stay in touch with one another and/or meet new people.  For example, a user of a social-networking application may establish connections with various other users (including, e.g., the user's friends, relatives, colleagues, and/or
acquaintances--as well as complete strangers) by linking his or her profile to the other users' profiles.  In this example, upon establishing such connections, the user may share various types of content (such as personal information, geo-location
information, photographs, and/or status updates) with the other users.
<br/><br/> Unfortunately, while conventional social-networking applications may enable users to share various types of content with one another, such social-networking applications may still fail to enable users to tailor their online behavior to different
groups of people in the same way that people may do so in the real world.  For example, a conventional social-networking application may fail to enable a user to share his or her resume with a group of business professionals while concealing the same
from a group of romantic suitors.  Similarly, the conventional social-networking application may fail to enable the user to highlight certain personal attributes to romantic suitors while concealing the same from business professionals.
<br/><br/> As such, the instant disclosure identifies a need for systems and methods for enabling users of social-networking applications to tailor their online behavior to other users based on their relationships with one another in the real world.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> As will be described in greater detail below, the instant disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for enabling users of social-networking applications to interact using virtual personas in order to maintain control over their
social-networking identities.  In one example, a computer-implemented method for accomplishing such a task may include (1) creating a social-networking identity associated with a user of a social-networking application, (2) creating a plurality of
virtual personas that represent different real-life roles of the user as part of the user's social-networking identity, (3) receiving a request to perform at least one networking action that implicates at least one of the user's virtual personas, and
then (4) directing the social-networking application to perform the networking action such that the networking action implicates the user's virtual persona without implicating the user's entire social-networking identity.
<br/><br/> Examples of the networking action include, without limitation, establishing a social-networking relationship between the user's virtual persona and at least one other user of the social-networking application, transmitting a message that
includes a link to at least one content instance associated with the user's virtual persona to at least one other user of the social-networking application, transmitting a message that includes at least one content instance associated with the user's
virtual persona to at least one other user of the social-networking application, sharing at least one content instance associated with the user's virtual persona with at least one other user of the social-networking application, associating at least one
content instance previously shared via the social-networking application with the user's virtual persona, and/or any other suitable networking action.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the method may also include defining at least one of the user's virtual personas by identifying a set of content instances associated with the user's social-networking identity and then associating at least one of the content
instances with the user's virtual persona.  Examples of the user's virtual personas include, without limitation, virtual personas that represent the user's role as an employee, the user's role as a professional, the user's role as a colleague, the user's
role as a relative, the user's role as a parent, the user's role as a child, the user's role as a friend, the user's role as an acquaintance, the user's role as a church member, the user's role as a student, the user's role as a job seeker, the user's
role as a romantic-relationship seeker, the user's role as an online social-group moderator, and/or any other suitable role of the user.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the method may also include providing the other user with access to at least one content instance associated with the user's virtual persona.  In such examples, the method may further include denying the other user access to at
least one other content instance associated with the user's social-networking identity but not associated with the user's virtual persona.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the method may also include receiving the request to perform the networking action from the user of the social-networking application.  In such examples, the method may further include receiving a request from the user to
establish a social-networking relationship between the user's virtual persona and the other user of the social-networking application.  In addition, the method may include analyzing the user's request to perform the networking action and then determining
that the user has selected the virtual persona to be associated with the networking action based on the analysis of the user's request.
<br/><br/> Additionally or alternatively, the method may include receiving the request to perform the networking action from at least one other user of the social-networking application.  In some examples, the method may also include receiving a request
from the other user to establish a social-networking relationship between the user's social-networking identity and the other user.  In such examples, the method may further include transmitting a request to obtain the user's consent to establish the
social-networking relationship between the user's social-networking identity and the other user.  In addition, the method may include obtaining the user's consent to establish a social-networking relationship between the user's virtual persona and the
other user without establishing the social-networking relationship between the user's entire social-networking identity and the other user.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the method may also include determining that the networking action implicates at least one other user of the social-networking application.  In such examples, the method may further include obtaining the other user's consent to
perform the networking action in response to determining that the networking action implicates the other user.  In addition, the method may include directing the social-networking application to perform the networking action in response to obtaining the
other user's consent.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the method may also include directing the social-networking application to perform the networking action such that the networking action implicates the user's virtual persona without implicating any other virtual persona
associated with the user's social-networking identity.  In some examples, the method may be performed by a plug-in that interfaces with the social-networking application.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the method may also include defining at least one geo-location associated with the user's virtual persona.  In such examples, the method may further include enabling the user to share, under the user's virtual persona, at least
one content instance that identifies the user's location while the user is located at the geo-location.  In addition, the method may include preventing the user from sharing the content instance that identifies the user's location under any other virtual
persona associated with the user's social-networking identity.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a system for implementing the above-described method may include (1) a creator module programmed to (a) create a social-networking identity associated with a user of a social-networking application and (b) create a plurality
of virtual personas that represent different real-life roles of the user as part of the user's social-networking identity, (2) a receiver module programmed to receive a request to perform at least one networking action that implicates at least one of the
user's virtual personas, and (3) a director module programmed to direct the social-networking application to perform the networking action such that the networking action implicates the user's virtual persona without implicating the user's entire
social-networking identity.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the above-described method may be encoded as computer-readable instructions on a computer-readable-storage medium.  For example, a computer-readable-storage medium may include one or more computer-executable instructions that,
when executed by at least one processor of a computing device, may cause the computing device to (1) create a social-networking identity associated with a user of a social-networking application, (2) create a plurality of virtual personas that represent
different real-life roles of the user as part of the user's social-networking identity, (3) receive a request to perform at least one networking action that implicates at least one of the user's virtual personas, and then (4) direct the social-networking
application to perform the networking action such that the networking action implicates the user's virtual persona without implicating the user's entire social-networking identity.

and 7, respectively.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary system 100 for enabling users of social-networking applications to interact using virtual personas.  As illustrated in this figure, exemplary system 100 may include one or more modules 102 for performing
one or more tasks.  For example, and as will be explained in greater detail below, exemplary system 100 may include a creator module 104 programmed to (1) create a social-networking identity associated with a user of a social-networking application and
(2) create a plurality of virtual personas that represent different real-life roles of the user as part of the user's social-networking identity.  Exemplary system 100 may also include a receiver module 106 programmed to receive a request to perform at
least one networking action that implicates at least one of the user's virtual personas.
<br/><br/> In addition, and as will be described in greater detail below, exemplary system 100 may include a director module 108 programmed to direct the social-networking application to perform the networking action such that the networking action
implicates the user's virtual persona without implicating the user's entire social-networking identity.  Although illustrated as separate elements, one or more of modules 102 in FIG. 1 may represent portions of a single module or application (such as a
social-networking application or a plug-in that interfaces with a social-networking application).
<br/><br/> In certain embodiments, one or more of modules 102 in FIG. 1 may represent one or more software applications or programs that, when executed by a computing device, may cause the computing device to perform one or more tasks.  For example, and as
will be described in greater detail below, one or more of modules 102 may represent software modules stored and configured to run on one or more computing devices, such as the devices illustrated in FIG. 2 (e.g., computing devices 202(1)-(N) and/or
server 206), computing system 610 in FIG. 6, and/or portions of exemplary network architecture 700 in FIG. 7.  One or more of modules 102 in FIG. 1 may also represent all or portions of one or more special-purpose computers configured to perform one or
more tasks.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 1, exemplary system 100 may also include one or more databases, such as database 120.  In one example, database 120 may be configured to store any type or form of data and/or information associated with a social-networking
identity 122.  For example, database 120 may be configured to store data and/or information associated with virtual personas 124(1)-124(N) that represent different real-life roles of a user associated with social-networking identity 122.  In addition,
although not illustrated in FIG. 1, database 120 may be configured to store any additional data and/or information used to enable users of social-networking applications to interact with one another using virtual personas.
<br/><br/> Database 120 may represent portions of a single database or computing device or a plurality of databases or computing devices.  For example, database 120 may represent a portion of server 206 in FIG. 2, computing system 610 in FIG. 6, and/or
portions of exemplary network architecture 700 in FIG. 7.  Alternatively, database 120 in FIG. 1 may represent one or more physically separate devices capable of being accessed by a computing device, such as server 206 in FIG. 2, computing system 610 in
FIG. 6, and/or portions of exemplary network architecture 700 in FIG. 7.
<br/><br/> Exemplary system 100 in FIG. 1 may be implemented in a variety of ways.  For example, all or a portion of exemplary system 100 may represent portions of exemplary system 200 in FIG. 2.  As shown in FIG. 2, system 200 may include computing
devices 202(1)-(N) in communication with a server 206 via a network 204.  Computing devices 202(1)-(N) may be programmed with one or more of modules 102 and/or may store all or a portion of the data in database 120.  Additionally or alternatively, server
206 may be programmed with one or more of modules 102 and/or may store all or a portion of the data in database 120.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, one or more of modules 102 from FIG. 1 may, when executed by at least one processor associated with at least one of computing devices 202(1)-(N) and/or server 206, facilitate at least one of computing devices 202(1)-(N) and/or
server 206 in enabling users of social-networking applications to interact using virtual personas.  For example, and as will be described in greater detail below, one or more of modules 102 may cause at least one of computing devices 202(1)-(N) and/or
server 206 to (1) create a social-networking identity associated with a user of a social-networking application, (2) create a plurality of virtual personas that represent different real-life roles of the user as part of the user's social-networking
identity, (3) receive a request to perform at least one networking action that implicates at least one of the user's virtual personas, and then (4) direct the social-networking application to perform the networking action such that the networking action
implicates the user's virtual persona without implicating the user's entire social-networking identity.
<br/><br/> Computing devices 202(1)-(N) generally represents any type or form of computing device capable of reading computer-executable instructions.  Examples of computing device 202 include, without limitation, laptops, tablets, desktops, servers,
cellular phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), multimedia players, embedded systems, combinations of one or more of the same, exemplary computing system 610 in FIG. 6, or any other suitable computing device.
<br/><br/> Server 206 generally represents any type or form of computing device capable of providing and/or facilitating a social-networking application used in connection with one or more additional computing devices (such as computing devices
202(1)-(N)).  Examples of server 206 and 306 include, without limitation, application servers, web servers, and database servers configured to run certain software applications and/or provide various web and/or database services.
<br/><br/> Social-networking application 208 generally represents any type or form of software application capable of facilitating a social network consisting of users of computing devices (such as computing devices 202(1)-(N)).  For example,
social-networking application 208 may represent a distributed software application collectively implemented by computing devices (such as computing devices 202(1)-(N) and/or server 206).  Additionally or alternatively, social-networking application 208
may represent a stand-alone software application capable of interfacing with other instances of the social-networking application via a network (such as network 204).  Examples of social-networking application 208 include, without limitation, <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b>
TWITTER, LINKEDIN, BUMP, MYSPACE, GOOGLE+, TAGGED, MATCH.COM, EHARMONY.COM, MYYEARBOOK, MEETUP, MYLIFE, MYHERITAGE, MULTIPLY, ORKUT, NING, CLASSMATES.COM, BEBO, FRIENDSTER, HI5, ORKUT, PERFSPOT, ZORPIA, NETLOG, HABBO, or any other application that
facilitates social networking.
<br/><br/> Network 204 generally represents any medium or architecture capable of facilitating communication or data transfer.  Examples of network 204 include, without limitation, an intranet, a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Local Area Network (LAN), a
Personal Area Network (PAN), the Internet, Power Line Communications (PLC), a cellular network (e.g., a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network), a Bluetooth network or communication, a Near Field Communication (NFC) network or
communication (as facilitated by, e.g., GOOGLE's ANDROID BEAM technology), exemplary network architecture 700 in FIG. 7, or the like.  Network 204 may facilitate communication or data transfer using wireless or wired connections.  In one embodiment,
network 204 may facilitate communication between computing devices 202(1)-(N) and/or server 206.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an exemplary computer-implemented method 300 for enabling users of social-networking applications to interact using virtual personas.  The steps shown in FIG. 3 may be performed by any suitable computer-executable
code and/or computing system.  In some embodiments, the steps shown in FIG. 3 may be performed by one or more of the components of system 100 in FIG. 1, system 200 in FIG. 2, computing system 610 in FIG. 6, and/or portions of exemplary network
architecture 700 in FIG. 7.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 3, at step 302 the various systems described herein may create a social-networking identity associated with a user of a social-networking application.  For example, creator module 104 may, as part of server 206 (or,
alternatively, as part of computing device 202(1)), create social-networking identity 122 associated with a user of social-networking application 208.  The phrase "social-networking identity," as used herein, generally refers to any type or form of
profile, user account, and/or user-specific webpage associated with a user of a social-networking application.
<br/><br/> The systems described herein may perform step 302 in a variety of ways.  In some examples, creator module 104 may collect information from the user of computing device 202(1) in order to create social-networking identity 122 based at least in
part on the user's information.  For example, creator module 104 may direct computing device 202(1) to display a user interface configured to collect information from the user as part of a registration of sign-up process associated with social-networking
application 208.  In one example, creator module 104 may direct computing device 202(1) to access a web-based user interface hosted by server 206 and then display the user interface to the user.  In another example, creator module 104 may direct
computing device 202(1) to access a client-based user interface stored locally on computing device 202(1) and then display the user interface to the user.
<br/><br/> In some examples, after computing device 202(1) has displayed the user interface, the user may enter various types of information into the user interface as part of the registration or sign-up process associated with social-networking
application 208.  In such examples, creator module 104 may collect the information entered by the user and then create social-networking identity 122 based at least in part on the information collected from the user.
<br/><br/> Additionally or alternatively, creator module 104 may import at least a portion of the user's information from one or more computer-based resources (such as one or more websites or additional social-networking applications).  For example,
creator module 104 may obtain the user's consent to access the user's profile associated with another social-networking application.  In this example, upon obtaining the user's consent, creator module 104 may access the user's profile associated with the
other social-networking application and then import (by, e.g., copying) at least a portion of the user's information from the user's profile into social-networking identity 122.
<br/><br/> In some examples, after creating social-networking identity 122, creator module 104 may modify social-networking identity 122 upon receiving a request from the user.  For example, the user may submit a request to update social-networking
identity 122 to include additional information omitted by the user during the initial registration or sign-up process.  In this example, creator module 104 may receive the request from the user and then update social-networking identity 122 in response
to the user's request.
<br/><br/> Examples of the user's information used to create, modify, and/or represent social-networking identity 122 include, without limitation, information that identifies one or more of the user's names, the user's nicknames, the user's current or
former physical addresses, the user's phone numbers, the user's email addresses, the user's current or former educational institutions, the user's pending or obtained educational degrees, the user's current or former employers, the user's current or
former occupations, the user's computing devices, the user's religions, the user's relationship statuses, the user's political views, the user's interests, the user's hobbies, the user's organizations, the user's business connections, the user's favorite
musical genres, the user's favorite musical artists, the user's favorite books, the user's favorite movies, the user's favorite television shows, the user's favorite games, the user's favorite athletes, and/or any other suitable information associated
with the user.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 3, at step 304 the various systems described herein may create a plurality of virtual personas that represent different real-life roles of the user.  For example, creator module 104 may, as part of server 206 (or,
alternatively, as part of computing device 202(1)), create virtual personas 124(1)-(N) that represent different real-life roles of the user of social-networking application 208.  In this example, creator module 104 may create virtual personas 124(1)-(N)
as part of social-networking identity 122.
<br/><br/> Examples of virtual personas 124(1)-(N) include, without limitation, virtual personas that represent the user's role as an employee, the user's role as a professional, the user's role as a colleague, the user's role as a relative, the user's
role as a parent, the user's role as a child, the user's role as a friend, the user's role as an acquaintance, the user's role as a church member, the user's role as a student, the user's role as a job seeker, the user's role as a romantic-relationship
seeker, the user's role as an online social-group moderator, and/or any other suitable role of the user.
<br/><br/> The systems described herein may perform step 304 in a variety of ways.  In some examples, creator module 104 may define one or more of virtual personas 124(1)-(N) based at least in part on the user's instructions.  For example, creator module
104 may receive a request from the user to create virtual persona 124(1) to represent the user's real-life role as an employee.  In another example, creator module 104 may receive a request from the user to create virtual persona 124(N) to represent the
user's real-life role as an acquaintance.
<br/><br/> In some examples, in response to the user's request, creator module 104 may direct computing device 202(1) to display a set of content instances associated with social-networking identity 122 to the user.  For example, creator module 104 may
direct computing device 202(1) to display content instances 400 in FIG. 4 to the user.  As illustrated in FIG. 4, content instances 400 may identify the user's name (in this example, "John Smith"), the user's home address (in this example, "1600 Friendly
St., Mountain View, Calif.  94040"), the user's personal phone number (in this example, "650-921-9476"), the user's personal email address (in this example, "JSmith@personalmail.com"), the user's work phone number (in this example, "650-293-0321"), the
user's work email address (in this example, "DrSmith@citymedical.com"), the user's current employment (in this example, "Physician at City Medical Center"), organizations to which the user belongs (in this example, "Civic Club, Aquarium Hobbyists Group,
Professional Medical Association"), the user's interests (in this example, "Fishing, Exercising, Gardening"), the user's favorite musical artists (in this example, "Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin"), the user's favorite books (in this example, "Moby Dick,
Huckleberry Finn, Frankenstein"), the user's political views (in this example, "Conservative"), and the user's religion (in this example, "Catholic").
<br/><br/> Although not illustrated in content instances 400 in FIG. 4, additional examples of content instances associated with social-networking identity 122 include, without limitation, any of the user's information used to create, modify, and/or
represent social-networking identity 122 (e.g., the user's information described above in connection with step 302), any images (e.g., photographic and/or video images) associated with social-networking identity 122, any content posted or otherwise
shared under social-networking identity 122 via social-networking application 208, and/or any other suitable content instances associated with the user's social-networking identity.
<br/><br/> In some examples, after computing device 202 has displayed the set of content instances associated with social-networking identity 122, the user may select one or more content instances from content instances 400 to be associated with one or
more of virtual personas 124(1)-(N).  For example, the user may select content instances 402 in FIG. 4 to be associated with virtual persona 124(1) representing the user's role as an employee.  As illustrated in FIG. 4, content instances 402 may identify
the user's name (in this example, "John Smith"), the user's work phone number (in this abbreviated example, "650-293 .  . . "), the user's work email address (in this abbreviated example, "DrSmith .  . . "), the user's employment (in this abbreviated
example, "Physician .  . . "), the user's organizations (in this abbreviated example, "Civic Club .  . . "), the user's interests (in this abbreviated example, "Fishing .  . . "), the user's favorite musical artists (in this abbreviated example, "Mozart
.  . . "), and the user's favorite books (in this abbreviated example, "Moby Dick .  . . "). In this example, creator module 104 may receive the user's selection of content instances 402 and then associate the same with the virtual persona 124(1).
<br/><br/> In another example, the user may select content instances 404 in FIG. 4 to be associated with virtual persona 124(N) representing the user's role as an acquaintance.  As illustrated in FIG. 4, content instances 404 may identify the user's name
(in this example, "John Smith"), the user's personal phone number (in this abbreviated example, "650-9 .  . . "), the user's personal email address (in this abbreviated example, "JSmith .  . . "), the user's employment (in this abbreviated example,
"Physician .  . . "), the user's organizations (in this abbreviated example, "Civic Club .  . . "), the user's interests (in this abbreviated example, "Fishing .  . . "), the user's favorite musical artists (in this abbreviated example, "Mozart .  . .
"), the user's favorite books (in this abbreviated example, "Moby Dick .  . . "), the user's political views (in this example, "Conservative"), and the user's religion (in this example, "Catholic").  In this example, creator module 104 may receive the
user's selection of content instances 404 and then associate the same with the virtual persona 124(N).
<br/><br/> In some examples, creator module 104 may assign different levels of data control to virtual personas 124(1)-(N).  For example, the user may require social-networking application 208 to obtain his or her consent prior to performing certain
networking actions in connection with virtual persona 124(1) but not require social-networking application 208 to obtain the user's consent to perform the same networking actions in connection with virtual persona 124(N).  In this example, creator module
104 may define the levels of data control associated with virtual personas 124(1)-124(N) to reflect the user's differing requirements regarding his or her consent to perform such networking actions.
<br/><br/> In some examples, creator module 104 may define one or more geo-locations associated with one or more of virtual personas 124(1)-(N) to facilitate geo-location reporting based on a geo-fencing paradigm.  For example, the user may upload
geo-location information that identifies the user's work buildings and/or offices to social-networking application 208.  In this example, upon uploading the geo-location information to social-networking application 208, the user may submit a request to
associate the work buildings and/or offices with virtual persona 124(1).  In response to the user's request, creator module 104 may direct social-networking application 208 to associate the user's work buildings and/or offices with virtual persona
124(1).
<br/><br/> By associating the user's work buildings and/or offices with virtual persona 124(1), social-networking application 208 may enable the user to share content that identifies the user's current location under virtual persona 124(1) while the user
is located at the work buildings and/or offices.  In addition, unless the user has also submitted a request to associate the work buildings and/or offices with virtual persona 124(N), social-networking application 208 may prevent the user from sharing
content that identifies the user's current location under virtual persona 124(N) while the user is located at the work buildings and/or offices.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 3, at step 306 the various systems described herein may receive a request after creating the user's virtual personas to perform at least one networking action that implicates at least one of the user's virtual personas. 
For example, receiver module 106 may, as part of server 206 (or, alternatively, as part of computing device 202(1)), receive a request to perform a networking action after creating virtual personas 124(1)-(N) associated with social-networking identity
122.  In this example, the requested networking action may implicate virtual persona 124(1) without implicating social-networking identity 122 as a whole or virtual persona 124(N).
<br/><br/> The systems described herein may perform step 306 in a variety of ways.  In some examples, receiver module 106 may receive the request to perform the networking action from the user of computing device 202(1).  For example, receiver module 106
may receive a request 500 in FIG. 5 from the user of computing device 202(1) to establish a social-networking relationship between virtual persona 124(1) and the user of computing device 202(N).  As illustrated in FIG. 5, request 500 may identify the
requested networking action (in this example, "Establish a social-networking relationship between Virtual Persona 124(1) and the user of Computing Device 202(N)"), the requester (in this example, "User of Computing Device 202(1)"), and the requestee (in
this example, "User of Computing Device 202(N)").
<br/><br/> In other examples, receiver module 106 may receive the request to perform the networking action from the user of computing device 202(N).  For example, receiver module 106 may receive a request from the user of computing device 202(N) to
establish a social-networking relationship between virtual persona 124(1) and the user of computing device 202(N).
<br/><br/> In another example, receiver module 106 may receive a request from the user of computing device 202(N) to establish a social-networking relationship between social-networking identity 122 as a whole and the user of computing device 202(N).  In
this example, in response to receiving the request, receiver module 106 may transmit a request to obtain the consent of the user of computing device 202(1) to establish the social-networking relationship between social-networking identity 122 as a whole
and the user of computing device 202(N).  For example, receiver module 106 may direct computing device 202(1) to query the user regarding his or her consent to establish the social-networking relationship between social-networking identity 122 and the
user of computing device 202(N).  In this example, the user of computing device 202(1) may answer the query by denying his or her consent to establish the social-networking relationship between social-networking identity 122 and the user of computing
device 202(N) but providing his or her consent to establish a social-networking relationship between virtual persona 124(1) and the user of computing device 202(N).
<br/><br/> In some examples, receiver module 106 may analyze the request to perform the networking action to determine whether the requested networking action implicates one or more of virtual personas 124(1)-(N) or social-networking identity 122 as a
whole.  In one example, upon analyzing a request received from the user of computing device 202(1), receiver module 106 may determine that the user has selected virtual persona 124(1) to be associated with the networking action based at least in part on
the analysis of the request.  For example, upon analyzing a request from the user of computing device 202(1) to post content via social-networking application 208, receiver module 106 may determine that the user has selected virtual persona 124(1) (as
opposed to, e.g., social-networking identity 122 or virtual persona 124(N)) to be associated with the content posted via social-networking application 208.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 3, at step 308 the various systems described herein may direct the social-networking application to perform the networking action such that the networking action implicates the user's virtual persona without implicating
the user's entire social-networking identity.  For example, director module 108 may, as part of server 206 (or, alternatively, as part of computing device 202(1)), direct social-networking application 208 to perform the networking action in response to
the request.  In this example, social-networking application 208 may perform the networking action such that the networking action implicates virtual persona 124(1) without implicating social-networking identity 122 as a whole or virtual persona 124(N).
<br/><br/> The systems described herein may perform step 308 in a variety of ways.  In one example, director module 108 may direct social-networking application 208 to establish a social-networking relationship between virtual persona 124(1) and the user
of computing device 202(N).  For example, prior to requesting a social-networking relationship with the user of computing device 202(N), the user of computing device 202(1) may assume virtual persona 124(1) by directing social-networking application 208
to perform all of the user's subsequent networking actions under virtual persona 124(1) rather than under social-networking identity 122 or virtual persona 124(N).
<br/><br/> In this example, after assuming virtual persona 124(1), the user of computing device 202(1) may direct social-networking application 208 to submit a request to establish a social-networking relationship with the user of computing device 202(N). 
The phrase "social-networking relationship," as used herein, generally refers to any type or form of connection, link, or association between users of a social-networking application as provided or otherwise facilitated by the social-networking
application.
<br/><br/> In one example, social-networking application 208 may need to obtain the consent of the user of computing device 202(N) prior to establishing the requested social-networking relationship.  In this example, upon obtaining the consent of the user
of computing device 202(N), social-networking application 208 may establish the requested social-networking relationship.  Since the user of computing device 202(1) had assumed virtual persona 124(1) prior to requesting the social-networking relationship
with the user of computing device 202(N), director module 108 may ensure that the social-networking relationship is established only between virtual persona 124(1) and the user of computing device 202(N).
<br/><br/> In one example, upon establishing the social-networking relationship between virtual persona 124(1) and the user of computing device 202(N), social-networking application 208 may provide the user of computing device 202(N) with access to all of
content instances 402 associated with virtual persona 124(1).  In contrast, even after establishing the social-networking relationship between virtual persona 124(1) and the user of computing device 202(N), social-networking application 208 may deny the
user of computing device 202(N) access to any content instances associated with social-networking identity 122 but not associated with virtual persona 124(1) (e.g., the user's home address, the user's personal phone number, the user's personal email
address, the user's political views, and/or the user's religion).
<br/><br/> In one example, director module 108 may direct social-networking application 208 to transmit a message that includes a link to virtual persona 124(1) to the user of computing device 202(N).  For example, as the user of computing device 202(1) is
entering a business meeting, he or she may assume virtual persona 124(1) by directing social-networking application 208 to perform all of the user's subsequent networking actions under virtual persona 124(1) rather than under social-networking identity
122 or virtual persona 124(N).  In this example, after striking up a conversation with the user of computing device 202(N) at the meeting, the user may submit a request to transmit his or her electronic business card to computing device 202(N) via
social-networking application 208.  Since the user had assumed virtual persona 124(1) prior to the transmission, director module 108 may ensure that the user's electronic business card transmitted via social-networking application 208 includes a link to
virtual persona 124(1) instead of a link to social-networking identity 122 or virtual persona 124(N).
<br/><br/> In one example, director module 108 may direct social-networking application 208 to transmit a message that includes at least one content instance associated with virtual persona 124(1) to the user of computing device 202(N).  For example, after
assuming virtual persona 124(1), the user of computing device 202(1) may submit a request to exchange contact information with the user of computing device 202(N) via social-networking application 208.  In this example, since the user had assumed virtual
persona 124(1) prior to the exchange, director module 108 may ensure that the contact information exchanged via social-networking application 208 includes the user's work phone number and/or work email address as opposed to the user's personal phone
number and/or personal email address.
<br/><br/> In one example, director module 108 may direct social-networking application 208 to share at least one content instance associated with virtual persona 124(1) with one or more other users of social-networking application 208.  For example, after
assuming virtual persona 124(1), the user of computing device 202(1) may submit a request to post a status update and/or photograph associated with the user via social-networking application 208.  In this example, since the user had assumed virtual
persona 124(1) prior to the posting, director module 108 may ensure that the status update and/or photograph posted via social-networking application 208 are visible only to other users of social-networking application 208 who have established a
social-networking relationship with virtual persona 124(1).
<br/><br/> In one example, director module 108 may direct social-networking application 208 to associate at least one content instance previously shared via social-networking application 208 with virtual persona 124(1).  For example, after assuming virtual
persona 124(1), the user of computing device 202(1) may submit a request to tag himself or herself in a photograph posted earlier by the user of computing device 202(N) via social-networking application 208.  In this example, since the user had assumed
virtual persona 124(1) prior to the tagging, director module 108 may ensure that the user's tag of himself or herself in the photograph is associated with virtual persona 124(1) as opposed to social-networking identity 122 or virtual persona 124(N).
<br/><br/> In some examples, director module 108 may direct social-networking application 208 to perform the networking action in accordance with the level of data control assigned to virtual persona 124(1).  For example, the user of computing device
202(N) may submit a request to tag the user associated with virtual persona 124(1) in a photograph posted via social-networking application 208.  In this example, director module 108 may determine that the user associated with virtual persona 124(1)
requires social-networking application 208 to obtain his or her consent prior to performing such a networking action.  In response to this determination, director module 108 may direct social-networking application 208 to obtain the user's consent prior
to tagging the user as virtual persona 124(1) in the photograph.

<br/><br/> As detailed above, computing system 610 and/or one or more components of network architecture 700 may perform and/or be a means for performing, either alone or in combination with other elements, one or more steps of an exemplary method for
enabling users of social-networking applications to interact using virtual personas.
<br/><br/> While the foregoing disclosure sets forth various embodiments using specific block diagrams, flowcharts, and examples, each block diagram component, flowchart step, operation, and/or component described and/or illustrated herein may be
implemented, individually and/or collectively, using a wide range of hardware, software, or firmware (or any combination thereof) configurations.  In addition, any disclosure of components contained within other components should be considered exemplary
in nature since many other architectures can be implemented to achieve the same functionality.
<br/><br/> In some examples, all or a portion of exemplary system 100 in FIG. 1 may represent portions of a cloud-computing or network-based environment.  Cloud-computing environments may provide various services and applications via the Internet.  These
cloud-based services (e.g., software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, etc.) may be accessible through a web browser or other remote interface.  Various functions described herein may be provided through a remote desktop
environment or any other cloud-based computing environment.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, all or a portion of exemplary system 100 in FIG. 1 may facilitate multi-tenancy within a cloud-based computing environment.  In other words, the software modules described herein may configure a computing system (e.g., a
server) to facilitate multi-tenancy for one or more of the functions described herein.  For example, one or more of the software modules described herein may program a server to enable two or more clients (e.g., customers) to share an application that is
running on the server.  A server programmed in this manner may share an application, operating system, processing system, and/or storage system among multiple customers (i.e., tenants).  One or more of the modules described herein may also partition data
and/or configuration information of a multi-tenant application for each customer such that one customer cannot access data and/or configuration information of another customer.
<br/><br/> According to various embodiments, all or a portion of exemplary system 100 in FIG. 1 may be implemented within a virtual environment.  For example, modules and/or data described herein may reside and/or execute within a virtual machine.  As used
herein, the phrase "virtual machine" generally refers to any operating system environment that is abstracted from computing hardware by a virtual machine manager (e.g., a hypervisor).  Additionally or alternatively, the modules and/or data described
herein may reside and/or execute within a virtualization layer.  As used herein, the phrase "virtualization layer" generally refers to any data layer and/or application layer that overlays and/or is abstracted from an operating system environment.  A
virtualization layer may be managed by a software virtualization solution (e.g., a file system filter) that presents the virtualization layer as though it were part of an underlying base operating system.  For example, a software virtualization solution
may redirect calls that are initially directed to locations within a base file system and/or registry to locations within a virtualization layer.
<br/><br/> The process parameters and sequence of steps described and/or illustrated herein are given by way of example only and can be varied as desired.  For example, while the steps illustrated and/or described herein may be shown or discussed in a
particular order, these steps do not necessarily need to be performed in the order illustrated or discussed.  The various exemplary methods described and/or illustrated herein may also omit one or more of the steps described or illustrated herein or
include additional steps in addition to those disclosed.
<br/><br/> While various embodiments have been described and/or illustrated herein in the context of fully functional computing systems, one or more of these exemplary embodiments may be distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, regardless of
the particular type of computer-readable-storage media used to actually carry out the distribution.  The embodiments disclosed herein may also be implemented using software modules that perform certain tasks.  These software modules may include script,
batch, or other executable files that may be stored on a computer-readable storage medium or in a computing system.  In some embodiments, these software modules may configure a computing system to perform one or more of the exemplary embodiments
disclosed herein.
<br/><br/> In addition, one or more of the modules described herein may transform data, physical devices, and/or representations of physical devices from one form to another.  For example, one or more of the modules recited herein may receive information
from a user of a social-networking application (e.g., social-networking application 208), transform the user's information into a social-networking identity (e.g., social-networking identity 122) that includes a plurality of virtual personas (e.g.,
virtual personas 124(1)-(N)), enable the user to perform at least one networking action that implicate at least one of the user's virtual personas without implicating the user's entire social-networking identity, and store the virtual personas in a
database located on one or more computing devices (e.g., computing devices 202(1)-(N) and/or server 206).  Additionally or alternatively, one or more of the modules recited herein may transform a processor, volatile memory, non-volatile memory, and/or
any other portion of a physical computing device from one form to another by executing on the computing device, storing data on the computing device, and/or otherwise interacting with the computing device.
<br/><br/> The preceding description has been provided to enable others skilled in the art to best utilize various aspects of the exemplary embodiments disclosed herein.  This exemplary description is not intended to be exhaustive or to be limited to any
