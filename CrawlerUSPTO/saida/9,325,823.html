<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings.  The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.  Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention.
<br/><br/> One or more embodiments disclosed herein may enable a user to quickly and easily identify and communicate with one or more contacts, through a display of a user device, such as a home telephone.  In one implementation, available contacts on the
user device may be associated with a graphical image or icon (such as a photograph) representing the contact.  The user device may present the contact images in a manner that enables a user to easily differentiate and locate a desired contact.  The user
device may further facilitate importation and/or retrieval of contact images for association with contacts.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is diagram of an exemplary user device 100.  As illustrated, user device 100 may include a base 102 and a handset 104.  User device 100 may include the functionality of a telephone and the ability to display contact information for
various contacts, among other things.  For example, base 102 may include a screen 118 that displays contact images associated with various contacts known to the user.  Functioning as a telephone, a user may answer a call by picking up handset 104 from
base 102.  In this example, handset 104 may communicate with base 102, which may communicate with a telephone network, for example.
<br/><br/> Base 102 may include a speaker 114, a microphone 116, a lens assembly 117, display 118, and control buttons 120 and 122.  Handset 104 may include a speaker 154, a microphone 156, a display 158, control keys 160, and a keypad 162.  User device
100 may include other components (not shown) that aid in receiving, transmitting, and/or processing data.  Moreover, other configurations of user device 100 are possible.
<br/><br/> Regarding base 102, speaker 114 may provide audible information to a user and microphone 116 may receive audible information from the user, such as during speakerphone or video call operation.  Display 118 may include a display screen to provide
visual information to the user, such as video images or pictures.  For example, display 118 may provide information regarding incoming or outgoing telephone calls, telephone numbers, contact information, current time, voicemail, email, etc. Lens assembly
117 may include an image capturing assembly for manipulating light rays from a given or a selected range, so that images in the range can be captured in a desired manner.  Display 118 may also provide graphical images relating to contacts known to the
user, as shown in FIG. 1.  Display 118 may include a touch-screen display to accept inputs from the user.  For example, display 118 may include a FAMILY icon 124 which, when touched, may cause user device 100 to display family-related contact images in a
contact display region 126.
<br/><br/> Control buttons 120 and 122 may permit the user to interact with user device 100 to cause user device 100 to perform one or more operations, such as advancing information displayed on display 118 backward (e.g., by pressing button 120) or

<br/><br/> The exemplary configuration illustrated in FIG. 2 is provided for simplicity.  It should be understood that a typical network may include more or fewer devices than those illustrated in FIG. 2.  For example, other devices that facilitate
communications between the various entities illustrated in FIG. 2 may also be included in network 200.  In addition, user devices 210-230 are each shown as separate elements.  In other instances, the functions described as being performed by two or more
user devices may be performed by a single user device.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is an exemplary diagram of a client device or server entity 300 (hereinafter called "client/server entity 300"), which may correspond to one or more of user devices 210/220 or network device 230.  User devices 210/220 and network device
230 may each include one or more client/server entities.  For example, base 102 may include an instance of client/server entity 300 and handset 104 may include another instance of client/server entity 300.  Client/server entity 300 may include a bus 310,
processing logic 320, an input device 330, an output device 340, a communication interface 350, and a memory 360.  Client/server entity 300 may include other components (not shown) that aid in receiving, transmitting, and/or processing data, such as
image data, video data, or audio data.  Moreover, other configurations of components in client/server entity 300 are possible.
<br/><br/> Bus 310 may include a path that permits communication among the components of client/server entity 300.  Processing logic 320 may include any type of processor or microprocessor (or groups of processors or microprocessors) that interprets and
executes instructions.  In other embodiments, processing logic 320 may include an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), or the like.
<br/><br/> Input device 330 may include a device that permits a user to input information into client/server entity 300, such as a keyboard (e.g., control keys 160, keypad 162, or control buttons 120 and 122), a mouse, a pen, a microphone (e.g., microphone
156 or 116), a remote control, a touch-screen display (e.g., display 118 or 158), a camera or video camera (e.g., lens assembly 117), etc. Output device 340 may include a device that outputs information to the user, such as a display (e.g., display 118
or 158), a printer, a speaker (e.g., speaker 114 or 154), etc.
<br/><br/> Input device 330 and output device 340 may allow the user to activate a particular service or application, such as an application to browse venue and event information.  Input device 330 and output device 340 may allow the user to receive and
view a menu of options and select options from the menu.  The menu may allow the user to select various functions or services associated with applications executed by client/server entity 300.  For example, the menu may allow the user to select an event
and purchase tickets to that event.
<br/><br/> Communication interface 350 may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables client/server entity 300 to communicate with other devices and/or systems.  Communication interface 350 may include a wired and/or wireless transmitter and a
wireless and/or wired receiver.  Communications interface 350 may include a network interface card, e.g., Ethernet card, for wired communications, or a wireless network interface (e.g., a WiFi, WiMAX, or HSDPA) card for wireless communications. 
Communication interface 350 may also include, for example, a universal serial bus (USB) port for communications over a cable, a Bluetooth wireless interface for communicating with Bluetooth devices, etc.
<br/><br/> Memory 360 may include a random access memory (RAM) or another type of dynamic storage device that may store information and instructions, e.g., an application, for execution by processing logic 320; a read-only memory (ROM) device or another
type of static storage device that may store static information and instructions for use by processing logic 320; and/or some other type of magnetic or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive, e.g., a hard disk drive (HDD), for storing
information and/or instructions.
<br/><br/> Memory 360 may include one or more applications 362 and application data 364.  In the case of base 102, for example, applications 362 may include an address book or contact dialer application for enabling users to identify and contact
individuals and/or entities, such as businesses, services, etc. Application data 364 may include user profile information associated with individual users of devices 210/220.  For example, base 102 may be used in a family environment in which the parents
and children each maintain separate user profiles.  Upon identification of a user (e.g., via user selection of a identifier at, for example, a home screen), base 102 may provide information corresponding to the identified user.  In addition to
user-displayed information, application data 364 may include additional user information, such as preferences, settings, etc.
<br/><br/> In the case of a network device 230, applications 362 may include a web server or other type of server application (e.g., an FTP (file transfer protocol) server) configured to store information and to send the information to user devices
210/220, either periodically, or upon request from user devices 210/220.  In this case, application data 364 may include image or contact information maintained in a web-accessible repository, such as an online address book or social networking
environment (e.g., <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Myspace).  Alternatively, application data 364 may include images data corresponding to a specific URL (uniform resource locator).  In other implementations, applications 362 may include a gateway server application for
receiving information and transmitting information to user devices 210/220.  For example, a gateway server application may include an application for receiving text messages (e.g., SMS (short message system) messages) or multimedia messages (e.g., MMS
messages) from a messaging system and forwarding the received messages to user devices 210/220.
<br/><br/> Client/server entity 300 may perform certain operations, as described herein.  Client/server entity 300 may perform these operations in response to processing logic 320 executing software instructions contained in a computer-readable medium,
such as memory 360.  A computer-readable medium may be defined as a physical or logical memory device.  The software instructions may be read into memory 360 from another computer-readable medium or from another device via communication interface 350. 
The software instructions contained in memory 360 may cause processing logic 320 to perform processes that are described herein.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an exemplary process 400 for providing a visual address book/dialing application on user device 210/220 of FIG. 2.  FIG. 4 is described with respect to FIGS. 5 and 6A-6D, which are diagrams of graphical user interfaces
(e.g., screens) that may be shown on display 118 of user device 100, for example.  For simplicity, process 400 is described below with respect to user device 210.
<br/><br/> Process 400 may begin when a user activates a communications or address book application on user device 210/220 (block 405).  For example, user device 210 may display a screen 500 as shown in FIG. 5 on display 118.  A user may select among
various functions offered by user device 100.  For example, a user could touch a CALENDAR icon 502 to display and interact with a calendar function or application, a CALCULATOR icon 504 to display and interact with a calculator function, a PHOTODIALER
icon 506 to display and interact with a messaging/address book function or application, or a TRAFFIC icon 508 to display and interact with a current traffic conditions application or function.  As shown, other icons for additional functionality may be
displayed on screen 500.  In this example, icon 506 is labeled PHOTODIALER; however, it should be noted that any suitable descriptive label may be used, such as ADDRESS BOOK, VISUAL ADDRESS BOOK, CONTACTS, etc. Activation of the address book function
(block 405) may correspond to a user selecting icon 506 on screen 500, for example.
<br/><br/> Device 210, in response to the selection of the address book function icon (e.g., icon 506), may display a list of contacts using graphical images or icons (block 410).  For example, user device 210 may display a screen 600 as shown in FIG. 6A
on display 118.
<br/><br/> As illustrated, screen 600 may include several display elements, including a navigation region 605, an image-based contact region 610, and a modification region 615.  Navigation region 605 may include selectable icons relating to various
user-defined groups of contacts, such as FAMILY icon 620, FRIEND icon 625, WORK icon 630, and OTHER icon 635.  Selection of each icon may result in a corresponding group of contacts being graphically displayed in image-based contact region 610.  As
illustrated in FIG. 6A, image-based contact region 610 corresponding to a selection of FAMILY icon 620 may include various images 640 corresponding to contacts categorized as family by a user of user device 210.
<br/><br/> Depending on settings associated with user device 210, user device 210 may be configured to display contacts corresponding to one of icons 620-635.  For example, user device 210 may be configured to display contacts corresponding to the
most-recently displayed group of contacts upon activation of the address book application (block 405).  In another implementation, user device 210 may be configured to display contacts corresponding to the most-frequently displayed group of contacts upon
activation of the address book application.  In still another implementation, user device 210 may be configured to display contacts corresponding to a pre-assigned group of contacts upon activation of the address book function (e.g., FAMILY contacts). 
It should be noted that, with respect to FIGS. 6A-6E, 8, and 9, individuals depicted in the contact images displayed in image-based contact region 610 have been anonymized by placing a black bar across recognizable features.  Actual contact images used
during the implementation of user device 210 would, of course, be provided without such protective features.
<br/><br/> As depicted in FIG. 6A, images displayed in image-based contact region 610 may be presented in multiple different sizes or layouts, such as, for example, a grid-based pattern or a free-form layout independent of any default spatial relationships
between contact images.  For example, images associated with more important or more frequently contacted contacts may be provided in a larger size than images associated with lesser-used contacts.  As described below, the sizing and relative positioning
of contact images may be set and/or modified by users in according with EDIT option 645, which may be included in modification region 615 of screen 600.  Features corresponding to EDIT option 645 will be discussed in detail below, with respect to FIGS. 7
and 8.
<br/><br/> The interactive image-based address book function provides a user of user device 210 with an efficient and easy to use interface for finding and contacting one or more contacts.  Returning to FIG. 4, user device 210 may receive a user selection
of an identified contact image provided in image-based contact region 610 (block 412).  For example, if user device 210 includes a touch screen display (e.g., display 118), the user selection of the contact image may be received via direct interaction
with the icon or image associated with the selected contact.  Alternatively, control keys associated with user device 210 may be used to select a particular one of the image-based contacts from among those displayed to the user.
<br/><br/> Upon receipt of the user selection of the identified contact, user device 210 may determine whether a size of the contact image is less than a predetermined threshold size (e.g., 72 pixels.times.72 pixels) (block 415).  As briefly described
above, images or icons associated with contacts may be sized differently by the user to reflect a relative importance or priority among the various contacts displayed.  If the selected contact is associated with an image or icon that is greater than or
equal to the predetermined threshold (block 415-NO), processing may continue to block 425 described below.
<br/><br/> However, if the selected contact is associated with an image or icon that is less than the predetermined threshold (block 415-YES), user device 210 (e.g., processor 320 may be configured to enlarge the image or icon to a predetermined size
(block 420).  For example, assume that display 118 of user device 210 has a screen resolution of 800 pixels wide by 480 pixels high (e.g., a WVGA resolution).  Further assume that the selected contact image (e.g., contact image 650) has a resolution of
40 pixels.times.58 pixels, which falls below the threshold of 72 pixels.times.72 pixels.  In this instance, selection of a contact image (e.g., contact image 650) may result in automatic enlargement of contact image 650 to a size equal to or greater than
the threshold and display of the enlarged contact image.  In one example, user device 210 may digitally zoom the contact image using any number of known techniques based on a level of processing or quality of resultant image desired.  In one
implementation, the selected contact image may transition from a smaller size to the enlarged size via a graphical animation, such as a morphing or ballooning effect.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6B illustrates graphical user interface screen 600 upon receiving a user selection of a particular contact image (e.g., block 410).  As illustrated in FIG. 6B, contact image 650 has been enlarged from a size depicted in FIG. 6A to a size
depicted in FIG. 6B.  By automatically enlarging smaller contact images upon selection, user device 210 provides users with a more accurate manner of positively identifying contacts prior to initiating communication with them.
<br/><br/> User device 210 may determine whether the selected contact has more than one contact number (e.g., phone number) associated therewith (block 425).  For example, a contact may have a home phone number, a work phone number, and a mobile or
cellular phone number.  If it is determined that the selected contact has more than one contact number associated therewith (block 425-YES), user device 210 may present a graphical listing of the available contact numbers for selection by a user (block
430).  FIG. 6B illustrates such a graphical listing 655 including a graphical cell phone representation 660, a graphical home phone representation 665, and a graphical office phone representation 670.  Although phone number graphical representations
660-670 illustrated in FIG. 6B do not specify contact numbers associated with the respective representations, it should be understood that alternative implementations may provide additional levels of information for display to the user, such as the
telephone numbers being displayed in a cloud or balloon adjacent to the contact image.
<br/><br/> In addition to graphical representations relating to individual contact numbers, screen 600 may also display a Call All graphical option 675.  Consistent with embodiments described herein, selection of Call All option 675 may instruct user
device 210 to sequentially call each number associated with a contact until one of the calls is answered, or none of the calls is answered.  In one implementation, the various contact numbers may be called in a predetermined order, such as office number,
then home number, then cell number.
<br/><br/> User device 210 may receive a user selection of one of the contact number representations 660-670 or Call All option 675 (block 435).  Alternatively, user device 210 may determine that the selected contact includes only a single contact number
(block 425-NO).  User device 210 may initiate a call to the selected number (block 440).  For example, user device 210 may initiate a call to user device 220 via network 240, such as a VoIP call, a PSTN call, a cellular-based (e.g., CDMA, GSM, etc) call,
or a video call (e.g., using lens assembly 117).
<br/><br/> User device 210 may update display 118, e.g., screen 600, to display the status of the initiated call and any call related options (block 445).  FIG. 6C illustrates screen 600 upon initiation of a call to the selected number.  As shown, user
device 210 may update screen 600 to display status information 680 associated with the call, such as the contact number being called and the full name of the contact.  In some implementations, user device 210 may be configured to highlight the selected
contact image in a variety of manners.  For example, in addition to being enlarged, the selected contact image may be brightened or otherwise graphically altered with respect to non-selected contact images.  Alternatively, non-selected contact images may
be dimmed or lightened, as illustrated in FIG. 6B, to effectively highlight a selected contact image.
<br/><br/> Additionally, screen 600 may be updated to display any available in-call options.  As shown in FIG. 6C, status information 680 may include an END option 685 and an ADD option 690.  Functionality associated with END option 685 and ADD option 690
will be described in additional detail below.  Additional in-call options (not shown) may include a mute option for deactivating microphone 114/156, a privacy shade option for temporarily deactivating lens assembly 117 during a video call, a hold option
for placing the currently connected call on hold, etc.
<br/><br/> Returning to FIG. 4, user device 210 may receive a user selection of END option 685 at any time during the call, either before connection with the called contact or during a connected call (block 450).  Upon receipt of END option 685, user
device 210 may terminate the current call (block 455) and processing may return to block 410 for display of the address book to the user.
<br/><br/> Returning to block 445, user device 210 may, during the call, receive a user selection of ADD option 690, to add another contact to the current call, where this service is available to the user (block 460).  In response to the selection of ADD
option 690, user device 210 may update screen 600 to display the list of contacts to the user, also designating the contact already included in the current call (block 465).
<br/><br/> FIG. 6D illustrates screen 600 upon selection of ADD option 690 in FIG. 6C.  As shown, user device 210 may update screen 600 to display a contact screen similar to imaged-based contact region 610, described above with respect to FIG. 6A. 
However, the contact image associated with the contact currently in the call (e.g., contact image 650) has been modified to designate the current call status, as depicted by modified contact image 650m being overlaid with a telephone handset symbol.
<br/><br/> User device 210 may receive a user selection of a second contact for addition to the current call (block 470).  In one implementation, a second contact may be added to the call in a number of ways.  For example, in one implementation, a second
contact image (e.g., contact image 695 in FIG. 6D) may be selected from image-based contact region 610.  The selected second contact image may then be dragged across image-based contact region 610 and dropped onto modified contact image 650m.  This
dragging and dropping functionality is represented in FIG. 6D by the dashed line connecting contact image 695 and contact image 650m.
<br/><br/> In an alternative implementation (not shown), second contact image 695 may be selected in a similar manner to first contact image 650.  User device 210 may present contact number options and the user may select one of the contact number options
for connection to the current call.
<br/><br/> User device 210 may initiate the call to the second selected contact (block 475) as a part of the current call.  Upon call completion, user device 210 may proceed to block 450 for receipt of the END option selection.  In one implementation, the
end call request may be based on a user action, such as replacing handset 104 onto base 102.  Alternatively, user device 210 may receive a selection of END option 685.  Regardless, processing may return to block 455, described above, for termination of
the current call.  A conference type call with the parties may then commence.
<br/><br/> User device 210 may periodically update screen 600 to reflect a recent call/communication history for each contact on image-based contact region 610.  For example contact images on image-based contact region 610 may be updated to reflect any
recently received calls, dialed calls, missed calls, voicemails, text messages, or emails.  FIG. 6E illustrates this concept.  As shown, contact images in image-based contact region 610, such as contact image 695 and contact image 697 may include
graphical representations of recent communication activities.  For example, each of contact images 695 and 697 may include graphical stacks, such as stack 698, depicting recent communications with the respective contacts, with each communication in the
stack represented by a layered (e.g., stacked) copy of the contact image modified to include a graphical icon representative of the type of communication.  For example, contact image 695 in FIG. 6E includes an associated stack 698 having three elements
depicting a recent text message and two missed calls.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of an exemplary process 700 for enabling importation and/or modification of contact images.  FIG. 7 is described with respect to FIG. 6A as well as FIGS. 8 and 9, which are additional diagrams of graphical user
interfaces (e.g., screens) that may be shown on display 118 of user device 100, for example.  For simplicity, process 700 is described below with respect to user device 210.
<br/><br/> Process 700 may begin when user device 210 receives a user selection of an edit option (block 705).  For example, a user may select EDIT option 645 in screen 600, as illustrated in FIG. 6A.  Upon receipt of the selection, user device 210 may
present a plurality of contact image editing options to the user (block 710).
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 is a diagram of user interface screen 600 following receipt of EDIT option 645.  As illustrated, editing options presented may include a SET IMAGE option 800, a RESIZE option 805, a MOVE option 810, and a SAVE option 820 in modification
region 615 of screen 600.
<br/><br/> User device 210 may receive a user selection of a contact for editing (block 715).  For example, as described above, user device 210 may receive a selection of a contact by direct interaction with a contact or contact image via a touch screen
display, etc. Upon selection of a contact, user device 210 may receive a user selection of SET IMAGE option 800 (block 720).  Upon receipt of the SET IMAGE option selection, user device 210 may provide an interface to the user to upload, retrieve, or
otherwise associate an image, icon, or photo with a selected contact (block 725).  For example, in one implementation, user device 210 may be configured to access and retrieve images from one or more sources, such as <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> MySpace, Picasa, Flickr,
Photobucket, SnapFish, etc. via network 240.  Alternatively, images may be retrieved from storage local to user device 210, such as maintained in memory 360.  Retrieved images may then be associated with one or more contacts for display in image-based
contact region 610 (block 730).
<br/><br/> In yet another implementation, images may be received via lens assembly 117 on user device 210.  For example, a user of user device 210 may, during the SET IMAGE option described above, capture or take a picture using lens assembly 117.  The
captured image may be associated with the selected contact.
<br/><br/> In one exemplary embodiment, meta data (e.g., tags) embedded or associated with a retrieved image may be used by user device 210 to identify a contact for association with an image.  For example, image(s) retrieved via a <b><i>Facebook</i></b> applications
programming interface (API) may be tagged or associated with one or more individuals.  User device 210 may be configured to compare identification information associated with the selected contact with meta data with the image(s) retrieved via the
<b><i>Facebook</i></b> API.  If user device 210 determines that one or more retrieved photos matches the contact information, user device 210 may display the image(s) to the user via the display for selection by the user.
<br/><br/> In other implementations, user device 210 may be configured to receive images from the user in other ways, such as via multimedia message service (MMS), a memory card, networked storage, a mobile phone or instant message application
synchronization, etc. Features associated with SET IMAGE option 800 may further include basic image editing functions, such as image cropping and/or rotation, to better enable users to display specific image information in relation to various contacts.
<br/><br/> Although photographs or other portrait-type images may be used for a majority of contact images, as depicted in FIGS. 6A-6D, it should be understood that any type of graphic may be used.  For example, emergency services contacts (e.g., Fire
Department, Police Department, etc.) may be identified by graphical elements or icons corresponding to the respective service.  Further, personalized artwork or images may be used as contact images, such as children's drawings, etc. Using such graphical
elements as contact images may enable user device 210 to be effectively used by children, illiterate, or foreign language-speaking users.  In addition, when depicting businesses or other organizations (e.g., web sites) that are typically not identified
as individuals (e.g., the local pizza place, the pharmacy, etc.), contact images may correspond to graphical identifiers that correspond to the organization, such as business logos, etc. Depending on the capabilities of user device 210, organization
contact images may also be used to direct user device 210 to a network location (e.g., Internet web site) corresponding to the associated organization.
<br/><br/> In additional implementations, a user profile may include information about the user currently logged into user device 210.  The information may include user preferences, address book and contact information associated with the user, etc. For
example, the user profile may include information corresponding to the contacts and contact images that should be displayed to the user (e.g., default size, default sorting options, etc.).  With respect to contact images, the stored user profile may
include information relating to the number of contacts for which contact images have not yet been set.  In one implementation, this information may be presented as a ratio (e.g., 10 of 100 contacts need images), while in other implementations, this
information may be presented as a percentage.  Tracking a number of contacts not including images may remind a user to retrieve and/or set images for those contacts that do not yet have contact images associated therewith.
<br/><br/> Once the user has identified an image for setting in relation to the selected contact, user device may receive a user selection of SAVE option 820 for storing the image association in user device 210 (block 740).
<br/><br/> User device 210 may receive a user selection of RESIZE option 805 (block 745).  As described briefly above, image-based contact region 610 may be configured to support contact images having multiple sizes and locations.  Such differentiated
sizing may provide users with an effective means for designating particular contacts as important or frequently called contacts.
<br/><br/> Upon receipt of the RESIZE option 805 selection, user device 210 may provide an interface to the user to resize the contact image associated with the selected contact (block 750).  For example, in one implementation, the selected contact image
may be surrounded by a dashed line or other similar highlighting, indicating to the user that the contact image may be resized.  User device 210 may receive a user indication of the amount of resizing to be performed (block 755).  For example, display
118 may include a multi-touch enabled display capable of receiving user resizing instructions by sensing the relative proximity of multiple contact points, with a shrinking proximity indicating a reduction in size and a growing proximity indicating an
increase in size.  Alternative, user device may receive a corner-based (e.g., aspect ratio maintaining) resizing indication from the user.
<br/><br/> User device 210 may dynamically modify a size of the selected contact image in response to the received resizing designation (block 760).  Once the user is satisfied with the amount of resizing, processing may proceed to block 740 where user
device 210 may receive a user selection of SAVE option 820 for storing the resized contact image.
<br/><br/> User device 210 may receive a user selection of MOVE option 810 (block 765).  Upon receipt of the MOVE option selection, user device 210 may provide an interface to the user to move the contact image associated with the selected contact (block
770).  For example, in one implementation, the selected contact image may be surrounded by a dashed line or other similar highlighting, indicating to the user that the contact image may be moved.  User device may receive a user indication of the desired
movement of the selected contact image (block 775).  For example, if display 118 is a touch screen display, user device 210 may be configured to enable the user to directly move the selected contact image to a desired position on image-based contact
region 610.  In one implementation, contact images currently displayed at the desired ending location of a moved image may be dynamically moved based on a predetermined algorithm.  For example, the contact images currently displayed at the desired ending
location may be shifted to the left or down to accommodate the moved contact image.
<br/><br/> User device 210 may dynamically modify a location of the selected contact image in response to the received resizing designation (block 780).  Once the user is satisfied with the location, processing may proceed to block 740 where user device
210 may receive a user selection of SAVE option 820 for storing the moved contact image.
<br/><br/> Contact images may include photos that include multiple contacts.  For example, contact image 652 in FIG. 6A illustrates a multi-contact image.  In one exemplary implementation, discrete portions of a multi-contact image (e.g., contact image
652) may be associated with different contacts.  As illustrated, contact image 652 depicts a photo of a women's' rugby team having ten members.  In accordance with embodiments described herein, portions of contact image 652 corresponding to those team
members included as contacts in user device 210 may be associated with respective contacts.  For example, the faces of each contact appearing in the photo may be associated with the respective contact as a discrete contact image.  Accordingly, a user may
select a contact appearing in the contact image by selecting the corresponding face from those appearing in the multi-contact image.  FIG. 9 is a diagram of an exemplary user interface screen 900 in which a particular contact 905 has been selected from
multi-contact image 910.  As described above in accordance with FIG. 6B, selection of contact 905 may result in user device 210 providing graphical representations 915 corresponding to available numbers associated with contact 905.
<br/><br/> In one implementation, identification of individual contacts from multi-contact images may be based on meta data included in or associated with the image.  For example, as described above, images retrieved from various sources may be tagged to
include identification information associated with individuals appearing in the images.  In some instances, the metadata may specify locations in the image file corresponding to specific individuals.  This metadata may be used to identify both the
existence and location of contacts appearing within a multi-contact image file.
<br/><br/> The foregoing description of exemplary implementations provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the embodiments described herein to the precise form disclosed.  Modifications and variations are
possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the embodiments.
<br/><br/> For example, various features have been mainly described above with respect to a user device configured to provide communications functionality.  In other implementations, features described herein may be implemented mainly in one or more
devices that are remote from a mobile or portable device, such as a web server or similar device accessed via, e.g., network 240.  For example, the user device may be configured to display contact information received from a remote network device.
<br/><br/> Further, while series of acts have been described with respect to FIGS. 4 and 7, the order of the acts may be varied in other implementations.  Moreover, non-dependent acts may be implemented in parallel.
<br/><br/> It will also be apparent that various features described above may be implemented in many different forms of software, firmware, and hardware in the implementations illustrated in the figures.  The actual software code or specialized control
hardware used to implement the various features is not limiting.  Thus, the operation and behavior of the features of the invention were described without reference to the specific software code--it being understood that one would be able to design
software and control hardware to implement the various features based on the description herein.
<br/><br/> Further, certain features described above may be implemented as "logic" that performs one or more functions.  This logic may include hardware, such as one or more processors, microprocessors, application specific integrated circuits, field
programmable gate arrays, or processing logic, software, or a combination of hardware and software.
<br/><br/> While particular graphical user interfaces have been described and shown in FIGS. 5, 6A-6E, 8, and 9 these interfaces or screens are purely exemplary.  In other embodiments, the interfaces or screens may have different, additional, or
differently arranged information and graphics.
<br/><br/> In the preceding specification, various preferred embodiments have been described with reference to the accompanying drawings.  It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto, and additional embodiments
may be implemented, without departing from the broader scope of the invention as set forth in the claims that follow.  The specification and drawings are accordingly to be regarded in an illustrative rather than restrictive sense.
<br/><br/> No element, act, or instruction used in the description of the present application should be construed as critical or essential to the invention unless explicitly described as such.  Also, as used herein, the article "a" is intended to include
one or more items.  Where only one item is intended, the term "one" or similar language is used.  Further, the phrase "based on" is intended to mean "based, at least in part, on" unless explicitly stated otherwise.
