<br/><br/> N/A
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to telecommunication techniques and integrated circuit (IC) devices.  More specifically, various embodiments of the present invention provide an integrated optical modulator device.
<br/><br/> Over the last few decades, the use of communication networks has exploded.  In the early days of the Internet, popular applications were limited to emails, bulletin board, and mostly informational and text-based web page surfing, and the amount
of data transferred was relatively small.  Today, Internet and mobile applications demand a huge amount of bandwidth for transferring photo, video, music, and other multimedia files.  For example, a social network like <b><i>Facebook</i></b> processes more than 500 TB
of data daily.  With such high demands on data and data transfer, existing data communication systems need to be improved to address these needs.
<br/><br/> CMOS technology is commonly used to design communication systems implementing Optical Fiber Links.  As CMOS technology is scaled down to make circuits and systems run at higher speed and occupy smaller chip (die) area, the operating supply
voltage is reduced for lower power consumption.  Conventional FET transistors in deep-submicron CMOS processes have very low breakdown voltage as a result the operating supply voltage is maintained around 1 Volt.  The Photo-detectors (PD) used in 28G and
10G Optical Receivers require a bias voltage of more than 2 Volts across the anode and cathode nodes of the PD for better photo-current responsivity.  These limitations provide significant challenges to the continued improvement of communication systems
scaling and performance.
<br/><br/> There have been many types of communication systems and methods.  Unfortunately, they have been inadequate for various applications.  Therefore, improved communication systems and methods are desired.
<br/><br/>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to telecommunication techniques and integrated circuit (IC) devices.  More specifically, various embodiments of the present invention provide an off-quadrature biased integrated optical modulator device.
<br/><br/> In optically amplified systems, the dominant noise source is the optical amplifier, which is typically an EDFA (Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier) in DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) systems.  The major component of the amplifier noise
in such systems is the signal-spontaneous beat noise, which is due to the interference between the amplified signal and ASE (Amplified Spontaneous Emission).  Considering that the noise power is relatively small in beat noise, this noise will dominate
when the signal power is at its highest.  Conversely, if there is no signal, there is no beat noise.
<br/><br/> In an example, the highest noise and largest eye closure happens at the top level for a 4-level PAM (Pulse-Amplitude Modulation) signal or the "1" level in the NRZ modulation format.  More specifically, if the different levels of the PAM-4
(4-level PAM) signal are set up in an equally spaced configuration, the noise impacts the top level most, and leads to the greatest eye closure.  However, if the individual levels can be reshaped such that the largest opening is at the top level, then
the noise contribution between the various levels can be equalized to improve system performance.  This technique can be applied to 4-level PAM systems, 8-level PAM systems, 16-level PAM systems, and the like.
<br/><br/> The present invention provides several embodiments of an electro-optical modulator with improved OSNR (Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio) by the application of an off-quadrature bias.  This application is counter intuitive, as typical applications
of an optical modulator, such as an MZM (Mach-Zehnder Modulator) or the like, are biased at quadrature (50% point in a DC characteristic plot) to produce the maximum signal swing.  However, by biasing the optical modulator off-quadrature and sacrificing
a portion of the signal swing, the optical modulator exhibits a much improved OSNR in an optically amplified system.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the present invention provides an optical modulator device.  This device can include a driver module coupled to an optical modulator.  The optical transfer function of a Mach Zehnder interferometer optical modulator is
characterized by a raised cosine or sine transfer function.  This optical modulator can be coupled to a light source and a bias control module, which is configured to apply an off-quadrature bias to the optical modulator.  This bias can be accomplished
by applying a DC bias function to the optical modulator in order to minimize a noise variance that is proportional to 2 {square root over (n.DELTA.P.sub.ASE)}, wherein n.DELTA.  is signal level n and P.sub.ASE is Amplified Spontaneous Emission Power. 
This compression function can result in an optimized increased top eye opening for a signal associated with the optical modulator.  Furthermore, the optical modulator can be coupled to an EDFA (Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier) that is coupled to a filter
coupled an O/E (Optical-to-Electrical) receiver.  Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
<br/><br/> Many benefits are recognized through various embodiments of the present invention.  Such benefits include improved system performance due to off-quadrature biasing of an optical modulator device.  Embodiments of this off-quadrature bias
configuration provide improvements to OSNR (Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of an optical system.  Other benefits will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that the mechanisms described can be applied to other optical systems as well.
<br/><br/> The present invention achieves these benefits and others in the context of known data transmission and optically amplified technologies.  However, a further understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention may be realized by
reference to the latter portions of the specification and attached drawings. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The present invention relates to telecommunication techniques and integrated circuit (IC) devices.  More specifically, various embodiments of the present invention provide an off-quadrature biased integrated optical modulator device.  With the
off-quadrature bias, the behavior of the optical modulator can be modified in order to minimize noise and improve system performance.
<br/><br/> The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and to incorporate it in the context of particular applications.  Various modifications, as well as a variety of uses in different

<br/><br/> Please note, if used, the labels left, right, front, back, top, bottom, forward, reverse, clockwise and counter clockwise have been used for convenience purposes only and are not intended to imply any particular fixed direction.  Instead, they

<br/><br/> In optically amplified systems, the dominant noise source is the optical amplifier, which is typically an EDFA (Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier) in DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) systems.  The major component of the amplifier noise
in such systems is the signal-spontaneous beat noise, which is due to the interference between the amplified signal and ASE (Amplified Spontaneous Emission).  Considering that the noise power is relatively small in beat noise, this noise will dominate
when the signal power is at its highest (e.g. highest light intensity).  Conversely, if there is no signal, there is no beat noise.
<br/><br/> In an example, the highest noise and largest eye closure happens at the top level for a 4-level PAM (Pulse-Amplitude Modulation) signal.  More specifically, if the different levels of the PAM-4 (4-level PAM) signal are set up in an equally
spaced configuration, the noise impacts the top level and leads to the greatest eye closure.  However, if the individual levels can be reshaped such that the largest opening is at the top level, then the noise contribution between the various levels can
be equalized to improve system performance.  This technique can be applied to 4-level PAM systems, 8-level PAM systems, 16-level PAM systems, and the like.
<br/><br/> In one or more embodiments, the present invention provides an electro-optical modulator with improved OSNR (Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio) by the application of an off-quadrature bias.  This application is counter intuitive, as typical
applications of an optical modulator, such as an MZM (Mach-Zehnder Modulator) or the like, are biased at quadrature (50% point in a DC characteristic plot) to produce the maximum signal swing.  However, by biasing the optical modulator off-quadrature and
sacrificing a portion of the signal swing, the optical modulator exhibits a much improved OSNR.  The following discussion of the figures will give examples of optical modulator devices and its method of operation.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram of an integrated optical modulator device according to an embodiment of the present invention.  As shown, optical modulator device 100 is configured in a test configuration coupled to a signal generator 110
and an oscilloscope 111.  The signal generator 110 can be configured to provide, by an RF cable, the oscilloscope 111 a 10 MHz reference signal, or other reference signal depending upon application.  The signal generator 110 can be an AWG (Arbitrary
Waveform Generator) 110, such as a 72 Gb/s AWG, or the like.  The oscilloscope 111 can be an RT (Real-Time) scope, such as a 63 GHz RT Scope, or the like.  This test configuration allows for testing of the optical modulator device by controlling inputs
and recording outputs.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the optical modulator device 100 can include a driver 120 coupled to an optical modulator 130.  The driver 120 can be a differential input, single-ended output, variable gain, linear driver, which can receive a differential
input from the AWG 110 by RF cables and transmit the signal output to the optical modulator 130.  A light source 131 and a bias control module 132 can both be coupled to the optical modulator 130.  In an example, the optical modulator 130 can be an MZM,
or the like, and the light source 131 can be a laser module, an ITLA (Integrable Tunable Laser Assembly), or the like.
<br/><br/> In a specific embodiment, the optical modulator driver 120, the light source 131, and the bias control module 132 all feed inputs via interconnections to the optical modulator 130.  The interconnection between the driver 120 and the optical
modulator 130 can be an RF (Radio Frequency) cable and the interconnection between the bias control module 132 and the signal relay module 130 can be a DC (Direct Current) electrical cable.  Also, the interconnection between the light source 131 and the
optical modulator 130 can be an optical fiber cable.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the optical modulator 130 can be coupled to an EDFA (Erbium-doped Fiber Amplifier) 140, which can be coupled to a tunable optical filter 150.  The optical filter 150 can be coupled to an O/E (Optical-to-Electrical) receiver
160.  The O/E receiver 160 can be coupled to the oscilloscope 111.  The interconnections from the O/E receiver 160 can be RF cables providing a differential output to the scope 111.  Also, an OSA (Optical Spectrum Analyzer) 112 can be coupled to the EDFA
140 to measure the EDFA parameters.  The OSA 112 can be configured to the EDFA 140 by a 10/90 tap coupler, which directs 10% to the output and 90% to the gain medium.
<br/><br/> In a specific embodiment, the signal relay module 130 can be coupled to a first VOA (Variable Optical Attenuator) 141 to the EDFA 140 and then to a second VOA 142, which is coupled to the tunable optical filter 150.  The interconnections between
these modules can be optical fibers characterized by 0, 10, or 20 km SMF (Single-Mode Fiber).  Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
<br/><br/> As described previously, as aspect of the present invention is to bias the optical modulator off-quadrature in order to obtain a much improved or optimal OSNR.  The optical modulator 130 is characterized by a raised cosine or sine transfer
function, which can be represented by the equation:
<br/><br/> .function..function..times..times..times..pi.  ##EQU00001## where v is the voltage input and v.sub.pi is the voltage needed to reach phase pi.  This is to say that the DC transfer function of the modulator exhibits the behavior of a sinusoidal
curve having phase characteristic of a cosine function with an average value or approximately 0.5.
<br/><br/> In order to achieve the expansion of the top level in the PAM-4 signal example, a DC bias function can be applied via the bias control module 132 to the optical modulator.  A method of expanding the top level of the PAM-4 signal is to apply a DC
bias compression function to compress the lower levels of the PAM-4 signal.  In a specific embodiment, this compression function is characterized by an inverse raised sine function, an inverse of the transfer function, or the like.  In the DC transfer
curve, this compression function squeezes the bottom half of the sinusoid curve, which can result in a more flattened trough.
<br/><br/> The result of this compression function is the compression of the bottom level of the PAM-4 signal and the expansion of the top level of the PAM-4 signal.  This result is desirable due to the increased eye opening at the top level, which suffers
from the most eye closure, and decreased eye opening at the bottom level, which suffers from the least eye closure.  An example of the improvement to the OSNR of an optical modulator is shown in the graph of FIG. 2B.  Additionally, FIGS. 3 and 4 show the
characteristic difference in a PAM-4 signal between a quadrature biased optical modulator and an off-quadrature biased optical modulator according an embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2A is a simplified graph showing a comparison of quadrature bias versus off-quadrature bias of a modulator transfer function for an optically amplified system according to an embodiment of the present invention.  Graph 201 illustrates a
modulator transfer curve with a quadrature bias point and an off-quadrature bias point marked on the curve.  As discussed previously, a bias compression function can be applied to an optical modulator to expand the top level of an optical signal (e.g.
PAM-4) by compressing the bottom level.  It is important to note that in biasing the optical modulator to expand the top signal level, the bias function must be towards the downwards direction or towards the null point, which is to compress the bottom or
the troughs of the DC transfer curve.  In applied in the upwards direction or the maximum transmission point, the top level would be compressed instead.  This result is highly undesirable as there would be greater eye closure as the top level, which
already suffers from the greatest eye closure.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2B is a simplified graph showing the system Bit Error Rate vs.  OSNR (Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio) for an off-quadrature biased optical modulator device and a quadrature biased optical modulator device according to an embodiment of the
present invention.  As shown, the graph 202 displays bit error rate, labeled as log 10(Pe), over OSNR measured in dB (decibels).  The "equispaced power levels configuration" is represented by the curve marked by "X", and the "unequal power levels by
offset bias point" configuration is represented by the curve marked by "O".  In this example, a 3.2 dB improvement in OSNR is obtained by use of the offset bias.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a simplified graph representing a signal output for a quadrature biased optical modulator device according to an embodiment of the present invention.  As shown, the graph 300 shows an example PAM-4 (4-level Pulse Amplitude Modulation)
signal according to the equispaced power levels configuration measured in dBm (decibel-milliwatts) over sample point number.  Here, the PAM-4 signal displays four signal levels with three equally spaced eye-opening regions.  This is the characteristic
behavior of a Mach Zehnder Modulator biased at quadrature.  FIG. 3 can represent the "equispaced power levels" configuration of FIG. 2.
<br/><br/> In order to determine the optimal bias function, the signal noise behavior for an optical modulator can be determined to minimize the noise at the top level.  According to an embodiment of the present invention, the noise related to ASE of
signal level n of an optical modulator was determined to be proportional to 2 {square root over (n.DELTA.P.sub.ASE)}.  Considering the PAM-4 signal example, the noise variances for each of the four signal amplitude levels can be represented by the
following equations: At signal level 0,.sigma..sub.0=0, At signal level .DELTA.,.sigma..sub.1=2 {square root over (.DELTA.P.sub.ASE,R.times.BW)}, At signal level 2.DELTA.,.sigma..sub.2=2 {square root over (2.DELTA.P.sub.ASE,R.times.BW)}, At signal level
3.DELTA.,.sigma..sub.3=2 {square root over (3.DELTA.P.sub.ASE,R.times.BW)}, where P.sub.ASE,R.times.BW is the Amplified Spontaneous Emission Power of the receiver bandwidth.
<br/><br/> Thus, an optical modulator can be biased using a bias control module, such as the one shown in FIG. 1, to compress the bottom level or levels of an optical signal to expand the top level or levels in order to minimize the overall signal noise,
which is represented by the term 2 {square root over (n.DELTA.P.sub.ASE)}.  In a specific embodiment, the individual levels of an optical signal can be reshaped such that the largest eye opening is at the top level and the noise contribution between the
various levels are equalized to improve overall system performance.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a simplified graph representing a signal output for an off-quadrature biased optical modulator device according to an embodiment of the present invention.  As shown, the graph 400 shows an example PAM4 signal according to the unequal
power levels by offset bias point configuration.  Here, the PAM4 signal displays four signal levels with three eye-openings with the top being expanded and the bottom being compressed.  FIG. 4 can represent the "unequal power levels" configuration of
FIG. 2.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a simplified graph showing the OSNR for optical modulator devices configured at various bias points according to embodiments of the present invention.  As shown, the graph 500 shows the result from a modulator bias point sweep
measuring BER (Bit Error Rate) over OSNR.  Here, bias voltage levels from 3.1V to 3.9V are displayed with each test level represented in the key to the lower left of the graph.  In this example, a 2.5 dB improvement over the quadrature bias was found in
with an off-quadrature bias of about 14 degrees (corresponding to the 3.7V bias).  The off-quadrature bias can be further optimized depending upon application.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the present invention provides an optical modulator device.  The device can include an MZM driver coupled to an MZM.  The MZM is characterized by a raised cosine or sine transfer function and is configured for a PAM (Pulse
Amplitude Modulation) signal having at least a top eye opening region and a bottom eye opening region.  The MZM can be coupled to a light source and a bias control module, which is configured to apply an off-quadrature bias to the optical modulator
device.  A first VOA coupled to the MZM, and an EDFA coupled to the first VOA and a second VOA.  Also, a tunable optical filter can be coupled to the second VOA and an O/E receiver coupled to the filter.
<br/><br/> In a specific embodiment, the bias control module is configured to improve an OSNR of the optical modulator device by applying an off-quadrature bias to the optical modulator device.  The bias control module is configured to apply the
off-quadrature bias to the optical modulator device a DC compression function, which can be an inverse of the transfer function.  This compression function is applied to the optical modulator in order to minimize a noise variance associated with the PAM
signal that is proportional to 2 {square root over (n.DELTA.P.sub.ASE)}, where n.DELTA.  is signal level n and P.sub.ASE is Amplified Spontaneous Emission Power.  Furthermore, the bias control module is configured to apply an off-quadrature bias to the
optical modulator such that the top eye opening is expanded and the bottom eye opening is compressed and a noise contribution associated with the noise variance for each level of the PAM signal is equalized.
<br/><br/> In a specific embodiment, the MZM driver module is configured for a PAM-4 signal modulation characterized by four discrete pulse amplitude levels, including first through fourth amplitude levels, and three eye opening levels, including top,
middle, and bottom eye openings.  This MZM driver can be a differential input, single-ended output, variable gain, linear driver.  Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
<br/><br/> Many benefits are recognized through various embodiments of the present invention.  Such benefits include improved system performance due to off-quadrature biasing of an optical modulator device.  Embodiments of this off-quadrature bias
configuration provide improvements to OSNR (Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of an optical system.  Other benefits will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that the mechanisms described can be applied to other optical systems as well.  The

to one another.  In an example, the technique uses a dither frequency on one of the biases (e.g., heater) and lock the ring to the maximum transmission of the second ring or grating, although there can be variations.  As shown in graph 1901, resonant
combs are generally misaligned in an example.  When tuned, thermally or otherwise, techniques can be used to selectively align one of the combs to another comb or spatial reference as shown in graph 1902.  In an example, to maintain alignment, the

1 to n, each of which has a modulator device 2140, and are collectively coupled to a spectral multiplexer 2160.  Each of the laser devices 2120 are coupled to a pair of control blocks, such as blocks 2111 and 2112, and monitor blocks 2130.  The spectral
multiplexer 2160 is coupled to a fiber interface 2170.  As shown is a broad band source 2150, as previously noted.
<br/><br/> FIG. 21 is a simplified diagram illustrating a laser configuration at a receiver side of a silicon photonics device according to an embodiment of the present invention.  As shown are a plurality of detectors 2210 numbered from wavelength 1 to n,
each of which has a oscillator device 2230, and are collectively coupled to a spectral multiplexer 2250.  Each of the photodetector blocks 2210 can be coupled to hybrid blocks 2220.  The spectral multiplexer is coupled to a fiber interface 2260.  As
shown is a broad band source 2240, as previously noted.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 22 and 23 are simplified diagrams illustrating a hybrid light source for a silicon photonics device according to an embodiment of the present invention.  As shown in FIG. 22, device 2301 includes a silicon substrate 2310 for photonics
devices, and an overlying buried oxide region 2320.  In FIG. 23, device 2302 includes the same substrate 2310 and buried oxide region 2320, and also includes an overlying crystalline silicon material 2330 configured for a waveguide or guides.  Of course,
there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
<br/><br/> FIG. 23 is a simplified diagram illustrating a wavelength control and locking configuration with a silicon photonic device according to an embodiment of the present invention.  As shown, device 2401 shows a laser device coupled to control
blocks, and a modulator block.  Drivers #1 and #2 are coupled to the control blocks #1 and #2.  A fixed bias setting is coupled to driver #2, whereas a variable bias setting is coupled to driver #1.  The monitor block coupled to the modular and laser
device is also coupled in series to a photocurrent detect circuit to TIA with bandwidth 2f-4f block, where the dither frequency is f, a minimum detect circuit to derivative block, and the variable bias setting block.  Graph 2402 shows the signal at the
monitor #1 block when dither is applied, showing the derivative signal in the bottom graph.  Graph 2403 shows the effect of applying dither to one comb on the wavelengths produced.  This self-test configuration can also be used in the detections of the
odd harmonics.
<br/><br/> FIG. 24 is a simplified diagram illustrating a wavelength control and locking configuration with a silicon photonics device according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention.  The device of 2501 shows a similar configuration to
device 2401 of FIG. 24.  Here, the photocurrent detect circuit includes a TIA with BW up to 2f or 4d with a band pass filter at 2f or 4f (which can be 2kf, where k=1, 2, 3, etc.) Graph 2502 shows the signal after the detect circuit when dither is applied
to one of the controls.  Graph 2503 shows the application of dither to one comb, similar to graph 2403 of FIG. 23.
<br/><br/> While the above is a full description of the specific embodiments, various modifications, alternative constructions and equivalents may be used.  Therefore, the above description and illustrations should not be taken as limiting the scope of the
present invention which is defined by the appended claims.
