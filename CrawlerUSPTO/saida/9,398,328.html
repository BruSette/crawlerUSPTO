<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> The present disclosure relates to a video display device and a method of controlling the same.
<br/><br/> As digital broadcasting is paving the way for its extensive spread, a broadcasting station transmits both main audio-visual (AV) contents and enhanced service data, which may be linked to the main AV contents to provide information and services
or may be separately provided for other purposes.
<br/><br/> However, a video display device in each home may unlikely receive broadcast signals directly through air under a current broadcasting environment.  Rather, most of cases, a video display device in each home is connected to a broadcast receiving
device to display uncompressed audio-visual contents that the broadcast receiving device provides.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the broadcast receiving device receives contents from a server (called a Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (MVPD)).  The MVPD receives a broadcast signal from a broadcasting station, extracts contents from the received
broadcast signal, converts the extracted content into signals having a proper format for transmission, and provides the converted signals to a broadcast receiving device.  During these processes, the MVPD may exclude extracted enhanced service data or
may add another enhanced service data, so that the broadcasting station may serve to provide AV contents but may not provide enhanced services led by the broadcasting station.
<br/><br/> Since the broadcast receiving device extracts main AV data from signal received from the MVPD and provides only uncompressed audio-visual data to a video display device, only enhanced services provided from the broadcast receiving device not the
video display device are available.  Furthermore, the broadcasting station may not provide enhanced services led by itself.
<br/><br/> Additionally, even when the broadcasting station provides enhanced services through wireless channels, the enhanced services may not be provided enough due to bandwidth limitation.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Embodiments provide a video display device available for enhanced services led by a broadcasting station and a method of controlling the same.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a method of controlling a video display device including a display unit includes: obtaining an uncompressed audio-visual (AV) content; playing the uncompressed AV content through the display unit; obtaining content information
of the uncompressed AV content on the basis of a section of the uncompressed AV content; obtaining an enhanced service on the basis of the content information; and playing the enhanced service through the display unit.
<br/><br/> In further another embodiment, a video display device includes: a display unit; a receiving unit for obtaining an uncompressed AV content; an enhanced service management unit for obtaining content information of the uncompressed AV content on
the basis of a section of the uncompressed AV content and obtaining an enhanced service on the basis of the content information; and a play controlling unit for playing the uncompressed AV content and the enhanced service on the display unit.

<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a watermark based network topology according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 2, the watermark based network topology may further include a watermark server 21.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 2, the watermark server 21 edits a main AV content to insert content information into it.  The multi channel video distributing server 30 may receive and distribute a broadcast signal including the modified main AV content. 
Especially, a watermark server may use a digital watermarking technique described below.
<br/><br/> A digital watermark is a process for inserting information, which may be almost undeletable, into a digital signal.  For example, the digital signal may be audio, picture, or video.  If the digital signal is copied, the inserted information is
included in the copy.  One digital signal may carry several different watermarks simultaneously.
<br/><br/> In visible watermarking, the inserted information may be identifiable in a picture or video.  Typically, the inserted information may be a text or logo identifying a media owner.  If a television broadcasting station adds its logo in a corner of
a video, this is an identifiable watermark.
<br/><br/> In invisible watermarking, although information as digital data is added to audio, picture, or video, a user may be aware of a predetermined amount of information but may not recognize it.  A secret message may be delivered through the invisible
watermarking.
<br/><br/> One application of the watermarking is a copyright protection system for preventing the illegal copy of digital media.  For example, a copy device obtains a watermark from digital media before copying the digital media and determines whether to
copy or not on the bases of the content of the watermark.
<br/><br/> Another application of the watermarking is source tracking of digital media.  A watermark is embedded in the digital media at each point of a distribution path.  If such digital media is found later, a watermark may be extracted from the digital
media and a distribution source may be recognized from the content of the watermark.
<br/><br/> Another application of invisible watermarking is a description for digital media.
<br/><br/> A file format for digital media may include additional information called metadata and a digital watermark is distinguished from metadata in that it is delivered as an AV signal itself of digital media.
<br/><br/> The watermarking method may include spread spectrum, quantization, and amplitude modulation.
<br/><br/> If a marked signal is obtained through additional editing, the watermarking method corresponds to the spread spectrum.  Although it is known that the spread spectrum watermark is quite strong, not much information is contained because the
watermark interferes with an embedded host signal.
<br/><br/> If a marked signal is obtained through the quantization, the watermarking method corresponds to a quantization type.  The quantization watermark is weak, much information may be contained.
<br/><br/> If a marked signal is obtained through an additional editing method similar to the spread spectrum in a spatial domain, a watermarking method corresponds to the amplitude modulation.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a ladder diagram illustrating a data flow in a watermark based network topology according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> First, the content providing server 10 transmits a broadcast signal including a main AV content and an enhanced service in operation S101.
<br/><br/> The watermark server 21 receives a broadcast signal that the content providing server 10 provides, inserts a visible watermark such as a logo or watermark information as an invisible watermark into the main AV content by editing the main AV
content, and provides the watermarked main AV content and enhanced service to the MVPD 30 in operation S103.
<br/><br/> The watermark information inserted through an invisible watermark may include at least one of a watermark purpose, content information, enhanced service information, and an available enhanced service.  The watermark purpose represents one of
illegal copy prevention, viewer ratings, and enhanced service acquisition.
<br/><br/> The content information may include at least one of identification information of a content provider that provides main AV content, main AV content identification information, time information of a content section used in content information
acquisition, names of channels through which main AV content is broadcasted, logos of channels through which main AV content is broadcasted, descriptions of channels through which main AV content is broadcasted, a usage information reporting period, the
minimum usage time for usage information acquisition, and available enhanced service information relating to main AV content.
<br/><br/> If the video display device 100 uses a watermark to acquire content information, the time information of a content section used for content information acquisition may be the time information of a content section into which a watermark used is
embedded.  If the video display device 100 uses a fingerprint to acquire content information, the time information of a content section used for content information acquisition may be the time information of a content section where feature information is
extracted.  The time information of a content section used for content information acquisition may include at least one of the start time of a content section used for content information acquisition, the duration of a content section used for content
information acquisition, and the end time of a content section used for content information acquisition.
<br/><br/> The usage information reporting address may include at least one of a main AV content watching information reporting address and an enhanced service usage information reporting address.  The usage information reporting period may include at
least one of a main AV content watching information reporting period and an enhanced service usage information reporting period.  A minimum usage time for usage information acquisition may include at least one of a minimum watching time for a main AV
content watching information acquisition and a minimum usage time for enhanced service usage information extraction.
<br/><br/> On the basis that a main AV content is watched for more than the minimum watching time, the video display device 100 acquires watching information of the main AV content and reports the acquired watching information to the main AV content
watching information reporting address in the main AV content watching information reporting period.
<br/><br/> On the basis that an enhanced service is used for more than the minimum usage time, the video display device 100 acquires enhanced service usage information and reports the acquired usage information to the enhanced service usage information
reporting address in the enhanced service usage information reporting period.
<br/><br/> The enhanced service information may include at least one of information on whether an enhanced service exists, an enhanced service address providing server address, an acquisition path of each available enhanced service, an address for each
available enhanced service, a start time of each available enhanced service, an end time of each available enhanced service, a lifetime of each available enhanced service, an acquisition mode of each available enhanced service, a request period of each
available enhanced service, priority information each available enhanced service, description of each available enhanced service, a category of each available enhanced service, a usage information reporting address, a usage information reporting period,
and the minimum usage time for usage information acquisition.
<br/><br/> The acquisition path of available enhanced service may be represented with IP or Advanced Television Systems Committee--Mobile/Handheld (ATSC M/H).  If the acquisition path of available enhanced service is ATSC M/H, enhanced service information
may further include frequency information and channel information.  An acquisition mode of each available enhanced service may represent Push or Pull.
<br/><br/> Moreover, the watermark server 21 may insert watermark information as an invisible watermark into the logo of a main AV content.
<br/><br/> For example, the watermark server 21 may insert a barcode at a predetermined position of a logo.  At this point, the predetermined position of the logo may correspond to the first line at the bottom of an area where the logo is displayed.  The
video display device 100 may not display a barcode when receiving a main AV content including a logo with the barcode inserted.
<br/><br/> For example, the watermark server 21 may insert a barcode at a predetermined position of a logo.  At this point, the log may maintain its form.
<br/><br/> For example, the watermark server 21 may insert N-bit watermark information at each of the logos of M frames.  That is, the watermark server 21 may insert M*N watermark information in M frames.
<br/><br/> The MVPD 30 receives broadcast signals including watermarked main AV content and enhanced service and generates a multiplexed signal to provide it to the broadcast receiving device 60 in operation S105.  At this point, the multiplexed signal may
exclude the received enhanced service or may include new enhanced service.
<br/><br/> The broadcast receiving device 60 tunes a channel that a user selects and receives signals of the tuned channel, demodulates the received signals, performs channel decoding and AV decoding on the demodulated signals to generate an uncompressed
main AV content, and then, provides the generated uncompressed main AV content to the video display device 100 in operation S106.
<br/><br/> Moreover, the content providing server 10 also broadcasts a broadcast signal including a main AV content through a wireless channel in operation S107.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the MVPD 30 may directly transmit a broadcast signal including a main AV content to the video display device 100 without going through the broadcast receiving device 60 in operation S108.
<br/><br/> The video display device 100 may receive an uncompressed main AV content through the broadcast receiving device 60.  Additionally, the video display device 100 may receive a broadcast signal through a wireless channel, and then, may demodulate
and decode the received broadcast signal to obtain a main AV content.  Additionally, the video display device 100 may receive a broadcast signal from the MVPD 30, and then, may demodulate and decode the received broadcast signal to obtain a main AV
content.  The video display device 100 extracts watermark information from some frames or a section of audio samples of the obtained main AV content.  If watermark information corresponds to a logo, the video display device 100 confirms a watermark
server address corresponding to a logo extracted from a corresponding relationship between a plurality of logos and a plurality of watermark server addresses.  When the watermark information corresponds to the logo, the video display device 100 cannot
identify the main AV content only with the logo.  Additionally, when the watermark information does not include content information, the video display device 100 cannot identify the main AV content but the watermark information may include content
provider identifying information or a watermark server address.  When the watermark information includes the content provider identifying information, the video display device 100 may confirm a watermark server address corresponding to the content
provider identifying information extracted from a corresponding relationship between a plurality of content provider identifying information and a plurality of watermark server addresses.  In this manner, when the video display device 100 cannot identify
a main AV content the video display device 100 only with the watermark information, it accesses the watermark server 21 corresponding to the obtained watermark server address to transmit a first query in operation S109.
<br/><br/> The watermark server 21 provides a first reply to the first query in operation S111.  The first reply may include at least one of content information, enhanced service information, and an available enhanced service.
<br/><br/> If the watermark information and the first reply do not include an enhanced service address, the video display device 100 cannot obtain enhanced service.  However, the watermark information and the first reply may include an enhanced service
address providing server address.  In this manner, the video display device 100 does not obtain a service address or enhanced service through the watermark information and the first reply.  If the video display device 100 obtains an enhanced service
address providing server address, it accesses the enhanced service information providing server 40 corresponding to the obtained enhanced service address providing server address to transmit a second query including content information in operation S119.
<br/><br/> The enhanced service information providing server 40 searches at least one available enhanced service relating to the content information of the second query.  Later, the enhanced service information providing server 40 provides to the video
display device 100 enhanced service information for at least one available enhanced service as a second reply to the second query in operation S121.
<br/><br/> If the video display device 100 obtains at least one available enhanced service address through the watermark information, the first reply, or the second reply, it accesses the at least one available enhanced service address to request enhanced
service in operation S123, and then, obtains the enhanced service in operation S125.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a view illustrating a watermark based content recognition timing according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 4, when the broadcast receiving device 60 is turned on and tunes a channel, and also, the video display device 100 receives a main AV content of the turned channel from the broadcast receiving device 60 through an external input
port 111, the video display device 100 may sense a content provider identifier (or a broadcasting station identifier) from the watermark of the main AV content.  Then, the video display device 100 may sense content information from the watermark of the
main AV content on the basis of the sensed content provider identifier.
<br/><br/> At this point, as shown in FIG. 4, the detection available period of the content provider identifier may be different from that of the content information.  Especially, the detection available period of the content provider identifier may be
shorter than that of the content information.  Through this, the video display device 100 may have an efficient configuration for detecting only necessary information.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a fingerprint based network topology according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 5, the network topology may further include a fingerprint server 22.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 5, the fingerprint server 22 does not edit a main AV content, but extracts feature information from some frames or a section of audio samples of the main AV content and stores the extracted feature information.  Then, when
receiving the feature information from the video display device 100, the fingerprint server 22 provides an identifier and time information of an AV content corresponding to the received feature information.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a ladder diagram illustrating a data flow in a fingerprint based network topology according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> First, the content providing server 10 transmits a broadcast signal including a main AV content and an enhanced service in operation S201.
<br/><br/> The fingerprint server 22 receives a broadcast signal that the content providing server 10, extracts a plurality of pieces of feature information from a plurality of frame sections or a plurality of audio sections of the main AV content, and
establishes a database for a plurality of query results corresponding to the plurality of feature information in operation S203.  The query result may include at least one of content information, enhanced service information, and an available enhanced
service.
<br/><br/> The MVPD 30 receives broadcast signals including a main AV content and enhanced service and generates a multiplexed signal to provide it to the broadcast receiving device 60 in operation S205.  At this point, the multiplexed signal may exclude
the received enhanced service or may include new enhanced service.
<br/><br/> The broadcast receiving device 60 tunes a channel that a user selects and receives signals of the tuned channel, demodulates the received signals, performs channel decoding and AV decoding on the demodulated signals to generate an uncompressed
main AV content, and then, provides the generated uncompressed main AV content to the video display device 100 in operation S206.
<br/><br/> Moreover, the content providing server 10 also broadcasts a broadcast signal including a main AV content through a wireless channel in operation S207.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the MVPD 30 may directly transmit a broadcast signal including a main AV content to the video display device 100 without going through the broadcast receiving device 60.
<br/><br/> The video display device 100 may receive an uncompressed main AV content through the broadcast receiving device 60.  Additionally, the video display device 100 may receive a broadcast signal through a wireless channel, and then, may demodulate
and decode the received broadcast signal to obtain a main AV content.  Additionally, the video display device 100 may receive a broadcast signal from the MVPD 30, and then, may demodulate and decode the received broadcast signal to obtain a main AV
content.  The video display device 100 extracts feature information from some frames or a section of audio samples of the obtained main AV content in operation S213.
<br/><br/> The video display device 100 accesses the fingerprint server 22 corresponding to the predetermined fingerprint server address to transmit a first query including the extracted feature information in operation S215.
<br/><br/> The fingerprint server 22 provides a query result as a first reply to the first query in operation S217.  If the first reply corresponds to fail, the video display device 100 accesses the fingerprint server 22 corresponding to another
fingerprint server address to transmit a first query including the extracted feature information.
<br/><br/> The fingerprint server 22 may provide Extensible Markup Language (XML) document as a query result.  Examples of the XML document containing a query result will be described with reference to FIG. 7 and Table 1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a view illustrating an XML schema diagram of ACR-Resulttype containing a query result according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 7, ACR-Resulttype containing a query result includes ResultCode attributes and ContentID, NTPTimestamp, SignalingChannelInformation, and ServiceInformation elements.
<br/><br/> For example, if the ResultCode attribute has 200, this may mean that the query result is successful.  For example, if the ResultCode attribute has 404, this may mean that the query result is unsuccessful.
<br/><br/> The SignalingChannelInformation element includes a SignalingChannelURL, and the SignalingChannelURL element includes an UpdateMode and PollingCycle attributes.  The UpdateMode attribute may have a Pull value or a Push value.
<br/><br/> The ServiceInformation element includes ServiceName, ServiceLogo, and ServiceDescription elements.
<br/><br/> Table 1 illustrates an XML schema of ACR-ResultType containing the query result.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 &lt;xs:complexType name="ACR-ResultType"&gt; &lt;xs:sequence&gt; &lt;xs:element name="ContentID" type="xs:anyURI"/&gt; &lt;xs:element name="NTPTimestamp" type="xs:unsignedLong"/&gt; &lt;xs:element

type="xs:string" use="required"/&gt; &lt;xs:anyAttribute processContents="skip"/&gt; &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
<br/><br/> As the ContentID element, an ATSC content identifier may be used as shown in Table 2.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 The Number Syntax of bits format ATSC_content_identifier( ) { TSID 16 uimsbf reserved 2 bslbf end_of_day 5 uimsbf unique_for 9 uimsbf content_id var }
<br/><br/> As shown in Table 2, the ATSC content identifier has a structure including TSID and a house number.
<br/><br/> The 16 bit unsigned integer TSID carries a transport stream identifier.
<br/><br/> The 5 bit unsigned integer end_of_day is set with an hour in a day of when a content_id value can be reused after broadcasting is finished.
<br/><br/> The 9 bit unsigned integer unique_for is set with the number of day of when the content_id value cannot be reused.
<br/><br/> Content_id represents a content identifier.  The video display device 100 reduces unique_for by 1 in a corresponding time to end_of_day daily and presumes that content_id is unique if unique_for is not 0.
<br/><br/> Moreover, as the ContentID element, a global service identifier for ATSC-M/H service may be used as described below.
<br/><br/> The global service identifier has the following form.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00003 - urn:oma:bcast:iauth:atsc:service:&lt;region&gt;:&lt;xsid&gt;:&lt;servicei- d&gt;
<br/><br/> Here, &lt;region&gt; is an international country code including two characters regulated by ISO 639-2.  &lt;xsid&gt; for local service is a decimal number of TSID as defined in &lt;region&gt;, and &lt;xsid&gt; (regional service) (major&gt;69) is
"0".  &lt;serviceid&gt; is defined with &lt;major&gt; or &lt;minor&gt;.  &lt;major&gt; represent a Major Channel number, and &lt;minor&gt; represents a Minor Channel Number.
<br/><br/> Examples of the global service identifier are as follows.  urn:oma:bcast:iauth:atsc:service:us:1234:5.1 urn:oma:bcast:iauth:atsc:service:us:0:100.200
<br/><br/> Moreover, as the ContentID element, an ATSC content identifier may be used as described below.
<br/><br/> The ATSC content identifier has the following form.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00004 urn:oma:bcast:iauth:atsc:content:&lt;region&gt;:&lt;xsidz&gt;:&lt;con tentid&gt;:&lt;unique_for&gt;:&lt;end_of_day&gt;
<br/><br/> Here, &lt;region&gt; is an international country code including two characters regulated by ISO 639-2.  &lt;xsid&gt; for local service is a decimal number of TSID as defined in &lt;region&gt;, and may be followed by "."&lt;serviceid&gt;. 
&lt;xsid&gt; for (regional service) (major&gt;69) is &lt;serviceid&gt;.  &lt;content_id&gt; is a base64 sign of a content_id field defined in Table 2, &lt;unique_for&gt; is a decimal number sign of an unique_for field defined in Table 2, and
&lt;end_of_day&gt; is a decimal number sign of an end_of_day field defined in Table 2.
<br/><br/> Hereinafter, FIG. 6 is described again.
<br/><br/> If the query result does not include an enhanced service address or enhanced service but includes an enhanced service address providing server address, the video display device 100 accesses the enhanced service information providing server 40
corresponding to the obtained enhanced service address providing server address to transmit a second query including content information in operation S219.
<br/><br/> The enhanced service information providing server 40 searches at least one available enhanced service relating to the content information of the second query.  Later, the enhanced service information providing server 40 provides to the video
display device 100 enhanced service information for at least one available enhanced service as a second reply to the second query in operation S221.
<br/><br/> If the video display device 100 obtains at least one available enhanced service address through the first reply or the second reply, it accesses the at least one available enhanced service address to request enhanced service in operation S223,
and then, obtains the enhanced service in operation S225.
<br/><br/> When the UpdateMode attribute has a Pull value, the video display device 100 transmits an HTTP request to the enhanced service providing server 50 through SignalingChannelURL and receives an HTTP reply including a PSIP binary stream from the
enhanced service providing server 50 in response to the request.  In this case, the video display device 100 may transmit the HTTP request according to a Polling period designated as the PollingCycle attribute.  Additionally, the SignalingChannelURL
element may have an update time attribute.  In this case, the video display device 100 may transmit the HTTP request according to an update time designated as the update time attribute.
<br/><br/> If the UpdateMode attribute has a Push value, the video display device 100 may receive update from a server asynchronously through XMLHTTPRequest API.  After the video display device 100 transmits an asynchronous request to a server through
XMLHTTPRequest object, if there is a change of signaling information, the server provides the signaling information as a reply through the channel.  If there is limitation in session standby time, a server generates a session timeout reply and a receiver
recognizes the generated timeout reply to transmit a request again, so that a signaling channel between the receiver and the server may be maintained for all time.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 is a block diagram illustrating a watermark and fingerprint based network topology according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 8, the watermark and fingerprint based network topology may further include a watermark server 21 and a fingerprint server 22.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 8, the watermark server 21 inserts content provider identifying information into a main AV content.  The watermark server 21 may insert content provider identifying information as a visible watermark such as a logo or an
invisible watermark into a main AV content.
<br/><br/> The fingerprint server 22 does not edit a main AV content, but extracts feature information from some frames or a certain section of audio samples of the main AV content and stores the extracted feature information.  Then, when receiving the
feature information from the video display device 100, the fingerprint server 22 provides an identifier and time information of an AV content corresponding to the received feature information.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a ladder diagram illustrating a data flow in a watermark and fingerprint based network topology according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> First, the content providing server 10 transmits a broadcast signal including a main AV content and an enhanced service in operation S301.
<br/><br/> The watermark server 21 receives a broadcast signal that the content providing server 10 provides, inserts a visible watermark such as a logo or watermark information as an invisible watermark into the main AV content by editing the main AV
content, and provides the watermarked main AV content and enhanced service to the MVPD 30 in operation S303.  The watermark information inserted through an invisible watermark may include at least one of content information, enhanced service information,
and an available enhanced service.  The content information and enhanced service information are described above.
<br/><br/> The MVPD 30 receives broadcast signals including watermarked main AV content and enhanced service and generates a multiplexed signal to provide it to the broadcast receiving device 60 in operation S305.  At this point, the multiplexed signal may
exclude the received enhanced service or may include new enhanced service.
<br/><br/> The broadcast receiving device 60 tunes a channel that a user selects and receives signals of the tuned channel, demodulates the received signals, performs channel decoding and AV decoding on the demodulated signals to generate an uncompressed
main AV content, and then, provides the generated uncompressed main AV content to the video display device 100 in operation S306.
<br/><br/> Moreover, the content providing server 10 also broadcasts a broadcast signal including a main AV content through a wireless channel in operation S307.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the MVPD 30 may directly transmit a broadcast signal including a main AV content to the video display device 100 without going through the broadcast receiving device 60 in operation S308.
<br/><br/> The video display device 100 may receive an uncompressed main AV content through the broadcast receiving device 60.  Additionally, the video display device 100 may receive a broadcast signal through a wireless channel, and then, may demodulate
and decode the received broadcast signal to obtain a main AV content.  Additionally, the video display device 100 may receive a broadcast signal from the MVPD 30, and then, may demodulate and decode the received broadcast signal to obtain a main AV
content.  The video display device 100 extracts watermark information from audio samples in some frames or periods of the obtained main AV content.  If watermark information corresponds to a logo, the video display device 100 confirms a watermark server
address corresponding to a logo extracted from a corresponding relationship between a plurality of logos and a plurality of watermark server addresses.  When the watermark information corresponds to the logo, the video display device 100 cannot identify
the main AV content only with the logo.  Additionally, when the watermark information does not include content information, the video display device 100 cannot identify the main AV content but the watermark information may include content provider
identifying information or a watermark server address.  When the watermark information includes the content provider identifying information, the video display device 100 may confirm a watermark server address corresponding to the content provider
identifying information extracted from a corresponding relationship between a plurality of content provider identifying information and a plurality of watermark server addresses.  In this manner, when the video display device 100 cannot identify a main
AV content the video display device 100 only with the watermark information, it accesses the watermark server 21 corresponding to the obtained watermark server address to transmit a first query in operation S309.
<br/><br/> The watermark server 21 provides a first reply to the first query in operation S311.  The first reply may include at least one of a fingerprint server address, content information, enhanced service information, and an available enhanced service. The content information and enhanced service information are described above.
<br/><br/> If the watermark information and the first reply include a fingerprint server address, the video display device 100 extracts feature information from some frames or a certain section of audio samples of the main AV content in operation S313.
<br/><br/> The video display device 100 accesses the fingerprint server 22 corresponding to the fingerprint server address in the first reply to transmit a second query including the extracted feature information in operation S315.
<br/><br/> The fingerprint server 22 provides a query result as a second reply to the second query in operation S317.
<br/><br/> If the query result does not include an enhanced service address or enhanced service but includes an enhanced service address providing server address, the video display device 100 accesses the enhanced service information providing server 40
corresponding to the obtained enhanced service address providing server address to transmit a third query including content information in operation S319.
<br/><br/> The enhanced service information providing server 40 searches at least one available enhanced service relating to the content information of the third query.  Later, the enhanced service information providing server 40 provides to the video
display device 100 enhanced service information for at least one available enhanced service as a third reply to the third query in operation S321.
<br/><br/> If the video display device 100 obtains at least one available enhanced service address through the first reply, the second reply, or the third reply, it accesses the at least one available enhanced service address to request enhanced service in
operation S323, and then, obtains the enhanced service in operation S325.
<br/><br/> Then, referring to FIGS. 10 and 18, the video display device 100 will be described according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 is a block diagram illustrating the video display device according to the embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 10, the video display device 100 includes a broadcast signal receiving unit 101, a demodulation unit 103, a channel decoding unit 105, a demultiplexing unit 107, an AV decoding unit 109, an external input port 111, a play
controlling unit 113, a play device 120, an enhanced service management unit 130, a data transmitting/receiving unit 141, and a memory 150.
<br/><br/> The broadcast signal receiving unit 101 receives a broadcast signal from the content providing server 10 or MVPD 30.
<br/><br/> The demodulation unit 103 demodulates the received broadcast signal to generate a demodulated signal.
<br/><br/> The channel decoding unit 105 performs channel decoding on the demodulated signal to generate channel-decoded data.
<br/><br/> The demultiplexing unit 107 separates a main AV content and enhanced service from the channel-decoded data.  The separated enhanced service is stored in an enhanced service storage unit 152.

<br/><br/> Hereinafter, referring to FIGS. 11 and 18, the enhanced service management unit 130 will be described according to various embodiments.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 is a hierarchy diagram of an enhanced service management unit according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 11, the enhanced service management unit 130 may include an operating system 131a, an audio driver 132a, a video driver 133a, a network driver 134a, an ACR platform application program interface (API) 135a, at least one ACR
engine 136a, an ACR daemon 137a, an ACR middleware 138a, and at least one ACR application 139a.
<br/><br/> When the enhanced service management unit 130 is used as shown in FIG. 11, a user doesn't need to necessarily recognize a channel or content and an ACR operation may be performed always.
<br/><br/> The enhanced service management unit 130 may access an application store through the data transmitting/receiving unit 141 to download application.
<br/><br/> The audio driver 132a may access an audio buffer used for audio fingerprint or audio watermark.
<br/><br/> The video driver 133a may access a video buffer used for video fingerprint or video watermark.
<br/><br/> The network driver 134a allows the ACR engine 136a to access the data transmitting/receiving unit 141.
<br/><br/> The platform API 135a provides API to allow the ACR engine 136a to access the audio driver 132a, the video driver 133a, and the network driver 134a.
<br/><br/> Since a plurality of broadcasting stations or content providers use respectively different content recognizing services, the video display device 100 may include a plurality of ACR engines 136a.  That is, the video display device 100 may include
an ACR engine for at least one of a plurality of video watermark extraction algorithms, a plurality of audio watermark extraction algorithms, a plurality of video signature extraction algorithms, and a plurality of audio signature extraction algorithms. 
The watermark based ACR engine 136a may extract watermark information, and then, may obtain at least one of a watermark purpose, content information, enhanced service information, and an available enhanced service from the extracted watermark
information.  The fingerprint based ACR engine 136a may extract feature information of a certain section of a main AV content, and then, may obtain at least one of content information, enhanced service information, and an available enhanced service on
the basis of the extracted feature information.
<br/><br/> The ACR daemon 137a manages at least one ACR engine 136a.  The daemon is executed continuously to process a periodic service request.  The daemon appropriately delivers the collected requests to allow another program to process them.  The ACR
daemon 137a may manage the execution and termination of the ACR engine 136a.  The ACR daemon 137a searches an ACR engine matching to a current main AV content among a plurality of ACR engines 136a.  Especially, if a system resource is consumed greatly
because several ACR engines are executed, the ACR daemon 137a sequentially executes the plurality of ACR engines 136a one by one according to a specific rule or priority to confirm whether content recognition is successful.  Additionally, if one of the
plurality of ACR engines 136a is successful in content recognition, the ACR daemon 137a obtains and executes an ACR application 139a corresponding to an enhanced service for the recognized content.  While the ACR engine 136a performs the content
recognition successfully, if contents are not recognized any more due to a channel change, the ACR daemon 137a may terminate the ACR application 139a.
<br/><br/> The ACR middleware 138a serves as a browser for at least one ACR application 139a.
<br/><br/> The ACR application 139a may provide user experience enhanced by ACR to a user.  The ACR application 139a may be an application downloaded from an application store or the Internet or may be a simple Uniform Resource Locator (URL).  The ACR
application 139a may provide content target advertisement, a content provider portal service, a program specific service such as electronic program guide (EPG), or a content provider specific service.  While the ACR application 139a interact with the ACR
engine 136a through the ACR application, it receives content information or signature from the ACR engine 136a and additionally obtains an enhanced service corresponding to the content information or signature to play them in the play device 120.  For
this, an ACR application interface that the ACR application 139a uses is shown in Table 3 below.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00005 TABLE 3 Name description Method String Return recognized content getContentID( ) id, or undefined if content has not been recognized.  Date getTiming( ) Return time stamp, or undefined if content has not been recognized or time
stamp is unavailable.  String Return the signature getSignature( ) captured, or undefined if capturing of the signature has failed.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of an enhanced service management unit according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> When the broadcast receiving device 60 and the video display device 100 are turned on and the external input port 111 of the video display device 100 is selected, the ACR daemon 137a obtains the content information of a main AV content
broadcasted in a tuned channel through at least one ACR engine 136a in operation S401.
<br/><br/> Then, the ACR daemon 137a obtains an available enhanced service relating to the content information in operation S403.
<br/><br/> The ACR daemon 137a executes the obtained enhanced service in background in operation S405.
<br/><br/> The ACR daemon 137a displays a color button on the display unit 121 to notify a user that enhanced service is available in operation S407.
<br/><br/> When the ACR daemon 137a receives the use of the enhanced service, it plays the enhanced service executed in background in the play device 120 in operation S409.
<br/><br/> If a change or main AV content is changed, the ACR daemon 137a recognizes a change through at least one ACR engine 136a and terminates the enhanced service in operation S411.

application 139b may provide content target advertisement, a content provider portal service, a program specific service such as electronic program guide (EPG), or a content provider specific service.
<br/><br/> While the ACR application 139b interacts with the ACR engine management unit 137b through the ACR application interface of the ACR middleware 138b, it may select the ACR engine 136b to be used.  For this, the ACR application interface that the
ACR application 139b uses is shown in Table 4 and Table 5 below.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00006 TABLE 4 Name description Property readonly List of ACR engines ACRCollection installed in the Receiver acrCollection Method ACR getACR(String Return an ACR object matched acrId) with ACR Id, or undefined if no item matched is

137b and receives it in operation S501.
<br/><br/> Then, the ACR application 139b starts the ACR engine 136b that it uses in operation S503 and obtains content information through the ACR engine 136b in operation S505.
<br/><br/> The ACR application 139b obtains an available enhanced service relating to a main AV content through the obtained content information in operation S507, and displays a color button on the display unit 121 to notify a user that an enhanced

<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 17, the enhanced service management unit 130 may include an operating system 131d, an audio driver 132d, a video driver 133d, a network driver 134d, an ACR platform API 135d, at least one ACR engine 136d, an ACR engine
management unit 137d, an application management unit 138d, and at least one ACR application 139d.
<br/><br/> When the enhanced service management unit 130 is used as shown in FIG. 17, a user doesn't need to necessarily recognize a channel or content and an ACR operation may be performed always.
<br/><br/> The audio driver 132d, the video driver 133d, the network driver 134d, the ACR platform API 135d, and the plurality of ACR engines 136d in the enhanced service management unit 130 of FIG. 17 are identical or similar to those 132a, 133a, 134a,
135a, and 136a in the enhanced service management unit 130 FIG. 11.  Therefore, their detailed descriptions will be omitted.
<br/><br/> The ACR engine management unit 137d confirms that the ACR engine 136d matches to the main AV content received from the external input port 111 and confirms that the ACR engine 136d matches to the application 139d.  At this point, the ACR engine
management unit 137d controls the plurality of ACR engines 136d to simultaneously or sequentially perform watermark extraction or query transmission.  The ACR engine management unit 137d controls the plurality of ACR engines 136d through priority.  If
one of the plurality of ACR engines 136d is successful in recognizing a main AV content, the ACR engine management unit 137d puts the remaining ACR engines in sleep mode and obtains the content information of the main AV content from the operating ACR
engine.
<br/><br/> While the application management unit 138d interacts with the ACR engine management unit 137d, it controls generation, start, stop, sleep, and termination of the ACR application.
<br/><br/> The ACR application 139d may be a built-in application.  The ACR application 139d may control the ACR engine 136b through functions shown in Table 13.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00015 TABLE 13 Name Function char *getContentID( ) calls Date getTiming( ) char *getSignature( ) Boolean registerEventListener- (EvtType evtType, Boolean (*eventListener)(EvtType evtType, char *contentId, Date *timing, char
*signature)); Data struct Date { Structure int year; int month; int day; int hour; int minute; int second; int msecond; }; typedef enum EvtType { EVT_PROGRAM_CHANGED, EVT_CHANNEL_CHANGED, EVT_ALL };
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of an enhanced service management unit according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> When the broadcast receiving device 60 and the video display device 100 are turned on and the external input port 111 of the video display device 100 is selected, the ACR engine management unit 137d confirms that the ACR engine 136a matches to
the main AV content received from the external input port 111 in operation S701.  At this point, the ACR engine management unit 137d controls the plurality of ACR engines 136d to simultaneously or sequentially perform watermark extraction or query
transmission.  The ACR engine management unit 137d controls the plurality of ACR engines 136d through priority.
<br/><br/> If one of the plurality of ACR engines 136d is successful in recognizing a main AV content, the ACR engine management unit 137d puts the remaining ACR engines in sleep mode in operation S702, and obtains the content information of the main AV
content from the operating ACR engine in operation S703.
<br/><br/> Then, the ACR engine management unit 137d confirms an available application relating to content information in operation S704, and requests the execution of the confirmed application 139d to the application management unit 138d.
<br/><br/> The application management unit 138d executes the confirmed application 139d in background in operation S705.
<br/><br/> The application 139d executed in background displays a color button on the display unit 121 to notify a user that enhanced service is available in operation S707.
<br/><br/> When the application 139d executed in background receives the use of the enhanced service from a user, it plays the enhanced service in the play device 120 in operation S709.
<br/><br/> If a channel or main AV content is changed in operation S710, the ACR engine management unit 137d confirms the ACR engine 136a matching to the application 139d and connects the confirmed ACR engine 136a to the application 139d in operation S711. At this point, the ACR engine management unit 137d controls the plurality of ACR engines 136d to simultaneously or sequentially perform watermark extraction or query transmission.
<br/><br/> If the application management unit 138d receives a user input for the termination of the application 139d in operation S712, it terminates the application 139d in operation S713.
<br/><br/> Then, referring to FIGS. 19 and 20, a method of synchronizing a play time of a main AV content with a play time of an enhanced service according to an embodiment will be described.
<br/><br/> Then, referring to FIGS. 19 and 20, a method of synchronizing a play time of a main AV content with a play time of an enhanced service according to an embodiment will be described.
<br/><br/> Enhanced service information may include a start time of an enhanced service.  At this point, the video display device 100 may need to start the enhanced service at the start time.  However, since the video display device 100 receives a signal
transmitting an uncompressed main AV content with no time stamp, the reference time of a plying time of the main AV content is different from that of a start time of the enhanced service.  Although the video display device 100 receives a main AV content
having time information, the reference time of a plying time of the main AV content may be different from that of a start time of the enhanced service, like rebroadcasting.  Accordingly, the video display device 100 may need to synchronize the reference
time of the main AV content with that of the enhanced service.  Especially, the video display device 100 may need to synchronize the play time of the main AV content with the start time of the enhanced service.
<br/><br/> First, the enhanced service management unit 130 extracts a certain section of a main AV content in operation S801.  The section of the main AV content may include at least one of some video frames or a certain audio section of the main AV
content.  Time that the enhanced service management unit 130 extracts the section of the main AV content is designated as Tn.
<br/><br/> The enhanced service management unit 130 obtains content information of a main AV content on the basis of the extracted section.  In more detail, the enhanced service management unit 130 decodes information encoded with invisible watermark in
the extracted section to obtain content information.  Additionally, the enhanced service management unit 130 may extract feature information in the extracted section, and obtain the content information of the main AV content from the fingerprint server
22 or the content information storage unit 151 on the basis of the extracted feature information.  Time that the enhanced service management unit 130 obtains the content information is designated as Tm.
<br/><br/> Moreover, the content information includes a start time Ts of the extracted section.  After the content information acquisition time Tm, the enhanced service management unit 130 synchronizes the play time of the main AV content with the start
time of the enhanced service on the biases of Ts, Tm, and Tn.  In more detail, the enhanced service management unit 130 regards the content information acquisition time Tm as a time Tp calculated by the following Equation 1.  Tp=Ts+(Tm-Tn) [Equation 1]
<br/><br/> Additionally, the enhanced service management unit 130 regards a time of when Tx elapses after the content information acquisition time as Tp+Tx.
<br/><br/> Then, the enhanced service management unit 130 obtains an enhanced service and its start time Ta on the obtained content information in operation S807.
<br/><br/> If the synchronized play time of the main AV content is identical to the start time Ta of the enhanced service, the enhanced service management unit 130 starts the obtained enhanced service in operation S809.  In more detail, the enhanced
service management unit 130 may start the enhanced service when the following Equation 2 is satisfied.  Tp+Tx=Ta [Equation 2]
<br/><br/> FIG. 20 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method of synchronizing a play time of a main AV content with a play time of an enhanced service according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 20, the video display device 100 extracts an AV sample during a system time Tn.
<br/><br/> The video display device 100 extracts feature information from the extracted AV sample, and transmits a query including the extracted feature information to the fingerprint server 22 to receive a query result.  The video display device 100
confirms whether a start time Ts of the extracted AV sample corresponds to 11000 ms at Tm by parsing the query result.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, the video display device 100 regards the time of when the start time of the extracted AV sample is confirmed according to Equation 1 as Ts+(Tm-Tn), so that, after that, the play time of the main AV content may be synchronized with
the start time of the enhanced service.
<br/><br/> Next, an ACR application will be described according to various embodiments with reference to FIGS. 21 to 50.
<br/><br/> The ACR application may include an auto playing application, a content provider application, and an video display manufacturer application.
<br/><br/> FIG. 21 is a screen when an auto playing application is executed according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> The auto playing application automatically plays an enhanced service even when a user makes no action.  In this sense, the auto playing application is designated as a lean back application in this specification.
<br/><br/> The auto playing application automatically plays an enhanced service such as scene related information that a content provider or broadcasting station provides during playing of the main AV content according to a play time of the main AV
content, without a user's input.  That is, a content provider or broadcasting station entirely controls the auto playing application.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 21, once the auto playing application is executed, the screen 200 may include a sub screen 210 where a reduced main AV content is played and a sub screen 220 where additional information is displayed.  The sub screen 200 where
additional information is displayed may be spatially separated from the sub screen 210 where a main AV content is played.
<br/><br/> Moreover, when an auto playing application is executed, an area where additional information is displayed may be semi-transparent.  In this case, the area where additional information is displayed may overlay on an area where a main AV content
played.
<br/><br/> FIG. 22 is a screen when a content provider application is executed according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> In this specification, the content provider application is designated as a full interactive application.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 22 (A), the video display device 100 downloads and stores a plurality of applications.  FIG. 22 (A) illustrates icons 230 of the applications.  A content provider application among the plurality of applications is an application
created and distributed by a content provider, and thus, may be under control of the content provider.
<br/><br/> A user of the video display device 100 may download a content provider application from an application store and determines whether to execute the downloaded content provider application.
<br/><br/> FIG. 22 (B) is a screen when a content provider application is executed.  As shown in FIG. 22 (B), the screen 200 may include the sub screen 210 where a reduced main AV content is played and the sub screen 220 where additional information is
displayed.
<br/><br/> Hereinafter, a video display device manufacturer application will be described according to an embodiment with reference to FIGS. 23 to 50.
<br/><br/> The video display device manufacturer application is created and controlled by a video display device manufacturer, and may be stored in advance when the video display device 100 is manufactured.  That is, the video display device manufacturer
application may provide the same service and user interface regardless of a content provider or content.
<br/><br/> The video display device manufacturer application may include an area where an enhanced service that a content provider provides is displayed and an area where an enhanced service that a video display device manufacturer provides is displayed,
separately.  A user of the video display device 100 may determine whether to execute the video display device manufacturer application.
<br/><br/> The video display device manufacturer application may have two types.
<br/><br/> The video display device manufacturer application of the first type has a resizing user interface.  The video display device manufacturer application having the resizing user interface reduces the size of an area where a main AV content is
displayed to display all the main AV content in a reduced area.  Additionally, the video display device manufacturer application having the resizing user interface reshapes an area where an application is displayed with an L or inverse-L shaped
structure.
<br/><br/> The video display device manufacturer application of the second type has an overlay user interface.  The video display device manufacturer application having the overlay user interface maintains the size of an area where a main AV content is
displayed, and overlaps an area where an application is displayed on the main AV content.  Since the area where an application is displayed covers the main AV content, an application area may be semi-transparent.
<br/><br/> FIG. 23 is a screen when a video display device manufacturer application having a resizing user interface is executed according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 23, the screen 300 of when a video display device manufacturer application having a resizing user interface is executed includes a main content area 310 where a main AV content is displayed, a main menu area 320 where a main
menu is displayed, a notification area 330 where a notification message is displayed, a control button area 340 where a control button is displayed to control the video display device manufacturer application, a sub menu area 350 where a sub menu is
displayed, an additional information area 360 where additional information is displayed, and an advertisement area 370 where advertisement is displayed.
<br/><br/> The control button area 340 includes an ending button 341 for ending the video display device manufacturer application, a hiding button 342 for hiding the video display device manufacturer application, and a back button 343 for returning to
previous information.
<br/><br/> In the video display device manufacturer application having the resizing user interface, the main AV content area 310 is disposed on the top-left of the screen 300; the main menu area 320 and the notification area 330 is disposed on the bottom
of the main AV content area 310; the control button area 340 is disposed on the top-left; the sub menu area 350 is disposed between the control button area 340 and the additional information area 360; the advertisement area 370 is disposed on the

<br/><br/> FIG. 24 is a screen when a video display device manufacturer application having an overlay user interface is executed according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 24, like the video display device manufacturer application having the resizing user interface, the screen 300 of when the video display device manufacturer application having the overlay user interface is executed includes a
main content area 310 where a main AV content is displayed, a main menu area 320 where a main menu is displayed, a notification area 330 where a notification message is displayed, a control button area 340 where a control button is displayed to control
the video display device manufacturer application, a sub menu area 350 where a sub menu is displayed, an additional information area 360 where additional information is displayed, and an advertisement area 370 where advertisement is displayed.
<br/><br/> In the video display device manufacturer application having the overlay user interface, the main AV content area 310 is disposed on the top-left of the screen 300; the main menu area 320 and the notification area 330 is disposed on the bottom of
the main AV content area 310; the control button area 340 is disposed on the top-left; the sub menu area 350 is disposed between the control button area 340 and the additional information area 360; the advertisement area 370 is disposed on the

<br/><br/> Hereinafter, a video display device manufacturer application having a resizing user interface will be mainly described.
<br/><br/> The video display device manufacturer application receives necessary information from an ACR engine built in the video display device 100 and has two types of menus largely according to its character.
<br/><br/> The first type menu is for a time insensitive enhanced service.  That is, when a menu relating to the time insensitive enhanced service is selected, the video display device 100 obtains an identifier of a main AV content that is currently played
on a screen, obtains an enhanced service on the basis of the obtained identifier, and displays the obtained enhanced service on the additional information area 360.  Examples of such a time insensitive enhanced service includes titles, genres, actors,
directors, and other people's evaluations, short clips, and short explanations.  Through this basic information, the video display device 100 may search additional information, link to a social network service such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b> and Twitter, or provide a
recommended service and a related advertisement.
<br/><br/> The second type menu is for a time sensitive enhanced service.  That is, when a menu relating to the time sensitive enhanced service is selected, the video display device 100 obtains an identifier and play time information of a main AV content
that is currently played on a screen, obtains a time sensitive enhanced service on the basis of the obtained identifier and play time information, and displays the obtained enhanced service on the additional information area 360.
<br/><br/> The main menu of the video display device manufacturer application includes a program menu, an information menu, a social menu, a recommendation menu, and a catalogue menu.  Among these, the time insensitive menu includes the information menu,
the social menu, the recommendation menu, and the catalogue menu, and the time sensitive menu includes the program menu.  If the time insensitive menu is selected, the time sensitive application may be called.  Other than these five main menus, other
main menus may be added.  If each main menu is selected, a sub menu of the selected main menu is displayed on the sub menu area 350.
<br/><br/> FIG. 25 is a flowchart illustrating a method of executing a video display device manufacturer application according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> When receiving a user input corresponding to an application selection menu display through pressing of a specific key of a remote controller, shaking of a motion remote controller in a downward direction, zooming of the cursor of a motion remote
controller in the bottom direction of the screen while a main AV content is played in operation S901, the video display device 100 displays an application selection menu of FIG. 26 in operation S903.
<br/><br/> FIG. 26 is a screen when an application selection menu is displayed according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 26, the application selection menu 380 is disposed at the bottom of the screen 300.  The application selection menu 380 may be semi-transparent.
<br/><br/> The application selection menu 380 includes execution icons of a plurality of applications installed in the video display device 100.  One icon of the displayed execution icons corresponds to the execution icon of the video display device
manufacturer application.
<br/><br/> When receiving a user input corresponding to an icon selection of the video display device manufacturer application through manipulating of the left and right arrow keys in a remote controller or moving of the cursor according to a movement of a
motion remote controller in operation S905, the video display device 100 executes the video display device manufacturer application in operation S907.  Through this, a user may immediately execute the application if he/she wants without access to an
application store while watching a main AV content.
<br/><br/> Once the video display device manufacturer application is executed, its main menu is displayed.  If a program menu is selected by default, its sub menu is displayed on the sub menu area 350.  An all sub menu is selected by default among the sub
menus of the program menu.  Focus is made on the all sub menu.  As time elapses, an enhanced service displayed on the additional information area 360 is automatically updated.  The &lt;- button is used for returning to a previous menu and the X button is
used for returning to an entire screen after closing the video display device manufacturer application.
<br/><br/> Then, a video display device manufacturer application will be described according to an embodiment with reference to FIGS. 27 to 29.
<br/><br/> The program main menu is a menu for displaying an application, which is time-related to a main AV content that is being played, on the additional information area 360.  Enhanced service information for displaying an application linking with the
main AV content may be provided from a content owner such as TV broadcasters.  The video display device 100 analyzes the enhanced service information to display a corresponding application in the additional information area 360 at the right timing.  UI
in a screen is shown in the drawing below.
<br/><br/> The program menu includes an all sub menu, a participation sub menu, and a discovery sub menu.
<br/><br/> The all sub menu is a menu for displaying all applications related to the participation sub menu and discovery sub menu on the additional information area 360.  The participation sub menu is a menu for displaying an application inducing program
participation such as voting in a program.  The discovery sub menu is a menu for displaying an application such as scene related information.  The sub menu of the program menu may be added or edited according to contents of an application that a content
owner wants.
<br/><br/> FIG. 27 is a screen when an all sub menu of a program main menu in a video display device manufacturer application is selected according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> When the all sub menu, i.e., the first sub menu of the program main menu, is selected, the video display device 100 displays all applications related to the participation sub menu and display sub menu on the additional information area 360.
<br/><br/> When the all sub menu is selected, the video display device 100 displays an application or event synchronized with a specific time on the additional information area 360.  If there is no application synchronized with a specific time, the video
display device 100 may leave the additional information area 350 as empty space.  However, since the empty space may not give motivation for additional interaction to a user, if there is no application synchronized with a specific time, the video display
device 100 may gather applications or events that occur prior to now in order to display a history.
<br/><br/> When a user enters into the video display device manufacturer application, it may be seen that the user may have an intention to perform an interactive application related to a main AV content while watching the main AV content.  While
navigating several menus, a user may not watch an event at a specific time.  Especially, when a user navigates menus for time insensitive enhanced services, the above case may likely occur.  Therefore, after entering into the video display device
manufacturer application, if a time sensitive event occurs during navigation, the video display device 100 displays a notification message for this on the notification area 330 to notify a user that there is a special event at the current time
broadcasted from a broadcasting station.
<br/><br/> While a user confirms music information or place information through the video display device manufacturer application, a time linked application occurs, the video display device 100 displays a notification message on the notification area 330. 
When receiving a user input corresponding to the Go To button press, the video display device 100 enters into a sub menu related to an occurring time linked application and displays the occurring time linked application on the additional information area
360.  The notification message may be a text message.  Additionally, the video display device 100 may display an amount of the delivered application as a number.  The notification message may be delivered to a viewer in a Push method.
<br/><br/> FIG. 28 is a screen when a participation sub menu of a program main menu in a video display device manufacturer application is selected according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 28, once the participation sub menu is selected, the video display device 100 displays an application inducing viewer participation such as voting on the additional information area 360.  If a viewer participation application
occurs, the video display device 100 displays it on the additional information area 360.  If the viewer participation application is voting, the video display device 100 may display voting questions and voting results.  Moreover, the video display device
100 displays current events and also previous events that the viewer participates on the bottom of the current event, for the viewer's convenience.
<br/><br/> FIG. 29 is a screen when a discovery sub menu of a program main menu in a video display device manufacturer application is selected according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 29, once the discovery sub menu is selected, the video display device 100 displays all time linked applications besides a viewer participation application on the additional information area 360.  For example, the video display
device 100 displays scene related information on products or places shown in a main AV content.  The video display device 100 may display current scene related information and previous scene related information simultaneously.
<br/><br/> Moreover, the video display device 100 may display a notification message that there is a time linked application or event on a sub menu.  For example, if a viewer participation application occurs, the video display device 100 displays an icon
having a flashing N on the participation sub menu to induce viewer participation.  If a user does not respond to the notification for a predetermined time, the video display device 100 may remove the notification.
<br/><br/> Hereinafter, an information main menu of a video display device manufacturer application will be described according to an embodiment with reference to FIGS. 30 to 36.
<br/><br/> The information main menu corresponds to a time insensitive area.  Like the UI of the program main menu, the information main menu does not operate in a UI manner that an application is automatically displayed and disappears at a specific time. 
Of course, although the above-mentioned time linked application may be displayed through this menu, when a main menu other than the program main menu is selected, a second service such as search service or Twitter service may be linked.
<br/><br/> The information main menu includes a search sub menu, a Twitter sub menu, and a news sub menu.
<br/><br/> Then, a search sub menu of an information main menu in a video display device manufacturer application will be described according to an embodiment with reference to FIGS. 30 to 32.
<br/><br/> FIG. 30 is flowchart illustrating a searching method according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> The video display device 100 extracts a certain section of a main AV content and obtains content information on the basis of the extracted section.
<br/><br/> Once the search sub menu of an information main menu in a video display device manufacturer application is selected in operation S1002, the video display device 100 obtains a search list including a plurality of search items corresponding to an
enhanced service on the basis of the obtained content information in operation S1003.  The search list includes at least one of genres, actors, directors, places, and products.
<br/><br/> The video display device 100 displays the search list on the additional information area 360 in operation S1007.  A display example of the search list will be described with reference to FIG. 30.
<br/><br/> FIG. 31 is a screen when a search sub menu of an information main menu in a video display device manufacturer application is selected according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 31, the search list includes characters of a main AV content.  The video display device 100 may display at least one of pictures or names of a search item on the additional information area 360.
<br/><br/> When one of a plurality of search items is selected through the cursor of a remote controller in operation S1009, the video display device 100 searches information on the selected search item in operation S1011.  At this point, the video display
device 100 may use an internet search engine such as Google.  Moreover, the video display device 100 may use information such as Tribune media or IMDb.
<br/><br/> The video display device 100 displays the searched information on the additional information area 360 in operation S1013.  Since the searched result is automatically retrieved through programming such as Open API of a service provider, time for
a screen design may be greatly saved.  A display example of the search information will be described with reference to FIG. 32.
<br/><br/> FIG. 32 is another screen when a search sub menu of an information main menu in a video display device manufacturer application is selected according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 32, the video display device 100 displays a search result for the selected search item on the additional information area 360.  Moreover, the video display device positions a Twitter button and an edit button on the additional
information area 360 to follow an actor's Twitter or edit an actor's profile such as filmography or biography.
<br/><br/> Like this, if the searching method according to an embodiment is used, information related to a main AV data may be searched through one click, so that an effort to input a search word may be reduced.
<br/><br/> Next, a Twitter sub menu of an information main menu in a video display device manufacturer application will be described according to an embodiment with reference to FIGS. 33 to 34.
<br/><br/> FIG. 33 is flowchart illustrating a chatting window displaying method according to an embodiment.
<br/><br/> The video display device 100 extracts a certain section of a main AV content and obtains content information on the basis of the extracted section in operation S1101.
<br/><br/> Once a Twitter sub menu of an information main menu in a video display device manufacturer application is selected in operation S1102, the video display device 100 obtains a Twitter chatting list corresponding to an enhanced service on the basis
of the obtained content information in operation S1103.  The video display device 100 writes a program name on Hashtag of Twitter to load a Twitter chatting list related to the program.  This chatting list is linked to Twitter and is continuously updated
in real time.
<br/><br/> The video display device 100 displays one chatting window in the Twitter chatting list on the additional information area 360 through a user selection or automatically in operation S1107.  A display example of the chatting window will be
described with reference to FIG. 34.
<br/><br/> FIG. 34 is a screen when a Twitter sub menu of an information main menu in a video display device manufacturer application is selected according to an embodiment.  6
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 34, the video display device 100 displays a chatting window on the additional information area 360 to support chatting between viewers watching the same program.
<br/><br/> When a program is broadcasted, a user of the program may directly write a message in a chatting room actually.  If the video display device 100 has a log in mechanism like Smart TV, a user of the video display device 100 may immediately start
chatting with his own ID in a logged in state when entering into a menu.  If it is inconvenient to make an input to the video display device 100 through a remote controller, the video display device 100 may display only a chatting message.  If the video
display device 100 is linked to a second device such as Smart Phone or tablet, a message may be typed using the input device of the second device.  Although information in Hashtag is a program name basically, it may be selected as a tag of actors or
directions, i.e., the above-mentioned another basic information, so that a user may selectively participate in chatting of a corresponding subject.
<br/><br/> Next, a news sub menu of an information main menu in a video display device manufacturer application will be described according to an embodiment with reference to FIGS. 35 to 36.
