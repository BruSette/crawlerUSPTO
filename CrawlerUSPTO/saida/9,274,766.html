<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> This disclosure generally relates to user interface.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A mobile computing device--such as a smartphone, tablet computer, or laptop computer--may include functionality for determining its location, direction, or orientation, such as a GPS receiver, compass, or gyroscope.  Such a device may also
include functionality for wireless communication, such as BLUETOOTH communication, near-field communication (NFC), or infrared (IR) communication or communication with a wireless local area networks (WLANs) or cellular-telephone network.  Such a device
may also include one or more cameras, scanners, touchscreens, microphones, or speakers.  Mobile computing devices may also execute software applications, such as games, web browsers, or social-networking applications.  With social-networking
applications, users may connect, communicate, and share information with other users in their social networks.
<br/><br/> A structured document such as a web page may include, for example, page layout information, scripts, page content such as text, media data (e.g., graphics, photos, video clips), and executable code objects (e.g., a game executable within a
browser window or frame).  Structured documents may be implemented with languages and technologies such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), JavaScript, WebGL, Cascading
Style Sheet (CSS) including CSS animations and transitions, and, frequently, Java.  A structured document may itself include references to multiple structured documents and contents.  For example, a web page may include one or more inline references by
incorporating Uniform Resource Locations (URLs) and/or script code (e.g., JavaScript, PHP, AJAX) that in response to a user event (e.g., a mouse click, a mouse hover-over), causes an application displaying the web page in a graphical user interface to
dynamically retrieve content specified by an URL and the script code.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, user-interface components of a graphical user interface of a software application on a computing device may be represented as layers, while the graphical user interface may be represented as a multi-layered-tree.  The
computing device may render the graphical user interface as a video based on the multi-layered-tree.  Each frame of the video may correspond to transforming, adding, or removing one or more layers in the multi-layered-tree.  In particular embodiments,
the overall user interface of the computing device may be represented as a multi-layered-tree with each sub-tree of the multi-layered-tree representing a graphical user interface of a software application on the computing device.  The computing device
may render a video for the overall user interface with a single animation system, while a software application's user interface may be treated as an HTML element.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, an input event associated with a user interface of a software application on a computing device may be de-coupled from its corresponding output.  A first computing thread on the computing device may receive an input
event, identify a second computing thread on the computing device to process the input event, and send the input event to the second computing thread.  The second computing thread may process the input event to generate a corresponding output.  Since the
first computing thread is de-coupled from the second computing thread, the first computing thread may continue receiving and processing subsequent input events, even if the second thread is non-responsive to the first input event. <br/><br/>BRIEF
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example method for rendering a graphical user interface as a video.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 2A-2E illustrate an example graphical user interface with a list of content items and an example multi-layered-tree representation of the graphical user interface.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 3A-3F illustrate an example home screen of a computing device and an example multi-layered-tree representation of the home screen.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates an example method for de-coupling an input associated with a graphical user interface from a corresponding output.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates an example computer system.
<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> A graphical user interface of an application allows a user to interact with the application.  A graphical user interface may include components such as text and media data (e.g., an image, an video clip) conveying information to a user.  A
graphical user interface of an application may also include components such as menus, selectable icons or text, or other control or input elements that allow a user to execute commands associated with the application or navigate within the graphical user
interface (or to a user interface of another application).
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments describe methods for rendering a graphical user interface as a video.  Each frame of the video may correspond to a particular placement of user interface components within the graphical user interface, while a new frame of
the video may correspond to transforming, adding or removing one or more components within the graphical user interface.  Particular embodiments also describe methods for de-coupling an input associated with a graphical user interface from a
corresponding output.  For example, particular embodiments may de-couple a touch input associated with a graphical user interface from rendering of the graphical user interface.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example method 100 for rendering a graphical user interface as a video.  The method 100 may be implemented by a computing device.  For example, the method 100 may be implemented by a process of an application (or an
operating system) executing on one or more processors of the computing device.  The computing device may be a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a smartphone, or any suitable computing device with a display.  The method 100 may begin
at step 110.  In particular embodiments, at step 110, the computing device may render as a first frame of a video a graphical user interface (GUI) of a software application on the computing device base on a multi-layered-tree representation of the
graphical user interface.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, two-dimensional items of the graphical user interface may be represented as layers, while the graphical user interface may be represented as a multi-layered-tree--i.e., a tree structured with multiple levels of layers. The multi-layered-tree representation of the graphical user interface may comprise a root layer and one or more child layers.  FIG. 2A illustrates an example graphical user interface 200 with a list of content items.  For example, the example graphical
user interface 200 may be a graphical user interface of a calendar application.  The example graphical user interface 200 may include a header 210 (e.g., displaying a text string "Bob's Calendar"), a footer 220 (e.g., displaying a selectable icon "New
Appointment"), and a list of content items 230 (e.g., a list of appointment items such as "03/05 Tue 10:00 AM: dentist", "03/06 Wed 4:00 PM: Sam soccer", and so on).  The example graphical user interface 200 may be represented as a multi-layered-tree 250
illustrated in FIG. 2B.  The example multi-layered-tree 250 may comprise a root layer 260 (e.g., representing a background color of the example graphical user interface 200), a child header layer 270 representing the header 210 illustrated in FIG. 2A,
and a child footer layer 275 representing the footer layer 220 illustrated in FIG. 2A.  The example multi-layered-tree 250 may also comprise a child structural layer 280 including children layers 285 that each represents a content item 230 illustrated in
FIG. 2A.  The structural layer 280 may serve as a structural "container" of its children layers 285.  The structural layer 280 may not have its own content and may not be visible in the example graphical user interface 200.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, each child layer of a multi-layered-tree representing a graphical user interface may comprise a geometrical property in its size and its transformation relative to its parent layer.  For example, a content item layer
285 (illustrated in FIG. 2B) representing a particular content item 230 (illustrated in FIG. 2A) may have a geometrical property in a size of 300 pixels in width and 50 pixels in height, and a transformation of 250 pixels in a vertical direction and 0
pixel in horizontal direction relative to the structural layer 280.  Another content layer 285 representing another content item 230 immediately below the particular content item 230 may have a geometrical property in a size of 300 pixels in width and 50
pixels in height, and a transformation of 300 pixels in a vertical direction and 0 pixel in horizontal direction relative to the structural layer 280.  In one embodiment, a geometrical property of a layer in a multi-layered-tree may be represented by a
four-by-four matrix.  In particular embodiments, the computing device may determine a placement of a content item within the graphical user interface by multiplying the transformation of the content item's corresponding layer in the multi-layered-tree by
the transformation of the layer's parent layer in the multi-layered-tree.  That is, the computing device may calculate a placement of a particular layer within the graphical user interface by traversing the multi-layered-tree from the root layer to the
particular layer and multiplying corresponding transformations.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the computing device may render the first frame of the video by generating a raster image (e.g., a bitmap image) for each of one or more layers of the multi-layered-tree representing the graphical user interface, and
compositing or combining the raster images into a single frame (i.e., a single image) of the video to be displayed in a display on the computing device.  The computing device may composite the raster images of the layers based on respective placements of
the layers' two-dimensional items in the graphical user interface.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, at step 120, the computing device may modify the multi-layered-tree representation of the graphical user interface in response to an input or output event associated with the graphical user interface of the software
application.  In particular embodiments, at step 130, the computing device may render as a second frame of the video the graphical user interface based on the multi-layered-tree representation of the graphical user interface as modified.  In particular
embodiments, the software application may be an event-driven software application.  In particular embodiments, the input or output event associated with the graphical user interface may comprise user input provided through the graphical user interface of
the software application.
<br/><br/> For example, the example graphical user interface 200 illustrated in FIG. 2A may be displayed in a touchscreen of the computing device.  A user may scroll up the list of content items 230 of the example graphical user interface 200 by performing
a sliding touch gesture on the example graphical user interface 200, as illustrated by the arrow in FIG. 2C.  In response to the input event associated with the example graphical user interface 200 (i.e., the user scrolling-up touch gesture), the
computing device may modify the corresponding multi-layered-tree 250 illustrated in FIG. 2B.  Instead of changing the transformation of each content layer 285, the computing device may modify the transformation of the structural layer 280 relative to the
root layer 260 (e.g., changing by 100 pixels in the upward vertical direction), while maintaining the respective transformation for content layers 285 relative to the structural layer 280.  The computing device may render as a second frame of the video
(for displaying the example graphical user interface 200) based on the multi-layered-tree representation as modified, as illustrated in FIG. 2D.  For example, the computing device may composite respective raster images for layers of the
multi-layered-tree 250 based on the modified transformation of the structured layer 280 relative to the root layer 260 as described above.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the computing device may modify the multi-layered-tree representation for the graphical user interface in response to an input or output event associated with the graphical user interface by adding a layer of the
multi-layered-tree representation.  For example, a user may perform a tap touch gesture on a particular content item 230 of the example graphical user interface 200 of a calendar application as illustrated in FIG. 2A, causing the calendar application to
create a pop-up window displaying details of the particular content item 230.  For another example, the calendar application may output a reminder of a particular content item 230 (e.g., based on a timer) by creating a pop-up window for the reminder.  As
illustrated in FIG. 2E, the computing device may add a layer 290 corresponding to the pop-up window, attach the layer 290 to the root layer 260 as a child layer to the root layer 260 of the example multi-layered-tree 250, and determine a geometrical
property (size and transformation) for the layer.  The computing device may, in response to the input event (user tap gesture) or the output event (reminder), render another frame of the video for the example graphical user interface 200 based on the
example multi-layered-tree 250 as modified (i.e., with the added layer 290 as illustrated in FIG. 2E).  The computing device may rendered the another frame by generating a raster image for the added layer 290, and composite raster images for the added
layers 290 and other layers of the example multi-layered-tree 250 based on their respective placements.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the computing device may modify the multi-layered-tree representation for the graphical user interface in response to an input or output event associated with the graphical user interface by removing a layer of the
multi-layered-tree representation.  For example, the user may dismiss the pop-up window described above (e.g., by selecting a "Dismiss" icon displayed within the pop-up window).  The computing device may, in response to the user's dismissal, remove the
layer 290 corresponding to the pop-up window from the example multi-layered-tree 250, and render another frame of the video for the example graphical user interface 200 with remaining layers of the example multi-layered-tree 250 as modified (i.e.,
without the layer 290).
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the overall user interface of the computing device (e.g., a home screen or a graphical representation of an operating system shell of the computing device) may be represented as a multi-layered-tree with each sub-tree
of the multi-layered-tree representing a graphical user interface of a software application on the computing device.  A window manager comprising one or more software components may manage input, output, and placement and displaying of components of the
overall user interface based on the multi-layer-tree.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a root-layer of the multi-layered-tree representing a graphical user interface of a software application on the computing device may be a child of a multi-layered-tree representation associated with a window manager of
the computing device.  Furthermore, in particular embodiments, each of a plurality of graphical user interfaces of a plurality of software applications on the computing device has a multi-layered-tree representation with a root that is a child of the
multi-layered-tree representation associated with the window manager.  That is, every software application's graphical user interface may be represented by a multi-layered-tree that is a child structure of the multi-layered-tree representing the home
screen of the computing device.  In particular embodiments, the window manager (or another process executed by one or more processors of the computing device) may render a frame of a video for the home screen of the computing device based on the
multi-layered-tree representation of the home screen.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3A illustrates an example home screen 300 of a computing device (e.g., a smartphone with a touchscreen).  The home screen 300 may encompass the entire area of the computing device's display.  FIG. 3B illustrates an example
multi-layered-tree 320 representing the home screen 300.  As illustrated in FIG. 3A, the example home screen 300 may comprise the example graphical user interface 200 of a calendar application illustrated in FIG. 2A.  Meanwhile, the root layer of the
multi-layered-tree 250 representing the example graphical user interface 200 for the calendar application may be a child layer of the multi-layered-tree 320 representing the home screen 300, as illustrated in FIG. 3B.  For example, the home screen 300
illustrated in FIG. 3A may also comprise a status bar 311 including a cellular signal-strength indicator, a carrier indicator, and a battery indicator, a clock 312, a selectable icon 313 for a phone application, a selectable icon 314 for an email
application, and a selectable icon 315 for a contacts application.  For example, as illustrated in FIG. 3B, the status bar 311 may be represented by a multi-layered-tree 331 with its root being a child layer of the multi-layered-tree 320.  The clock 312
may be represented by a multi-layered-tree 332 with its root being a child layer of the multi-layered-tree 320.  The phone application icon 313 may be represented by a multi-layered-tree 333 with its root being a child layer of the multi-layered-tree
320.  The email application icon 314 may be represented by a multi-layered-tree 334 with its root being a child layer of the multi-layered-tree 320.  The contacts application icon 335 may be represented by a multi-layered-tree 335 with its root being a
child layer of the multi-layered-tree 320.  That is, each of the graphical user interfaces (of the software applications) within the home screen 300 may be represented as a sub-tree of the multi-layered-tree 320 representing the home screen 300.  In one
embodiment, a multi-layered-tree representation of a first software application on the computing device may be a child structure of a multi-layered-tree representation of a second software application on the computing device.  Furthermore, each layer of
the multi-layered-tree 330 may comprise a geometrical property in size and transformation (relative to respective parent layer) as described earlier.  The window manager may calculate a placement for a child layer based on its own transformation and its
parent's transformation as described earlier.
<br/><br/> As described earlier with the method 100, the window manager may render a frame of a video for the home screen 300 based on the multi-layered-tree 320 representing the home screen 300.  For example, the window manager may generate raster images
for two-dimensional items of the home screen 300 (e.g., the status bar 311, the clock 312, the calendar application's graphical user interface 200, and so on), and calculate a placement for each of the two-dimensional items.  The window manager may
composite the raster images into a frame (a single image) of the video for the home screen 300 based on respective placements of the two-dimensional items within the home screen 300.
<br/><br/> The window manager may modify the multi-layered-tree 320 representing the home screen 300 in response to an input or output event associated with the home screen 300.  The window manager may modify the multi-layered-tree 320 by modifying a
transformation of a layer, adding a layer to the multi-layered-tree 320, or removing a layer from the multi-layered-tree 320.  The window manager may render another frame of the video for the home screen 320 based on the multi-layered-tree 320 as
modified.  For example, a user the computing device may dismiss the calendar application's graphical user interface 200 by performing a flick touch gesture as indicated by the arrow illustrated in FIG. 3C.  In response to the user input event (i.e., the
flick touch gesture), the window manager may remove children layers from the multi-layered-tree 250 representing the calendar application's graphical user interface 200, and attach to the root layer (of the multi-layered-tree 250) a child layer 351
representing a selectable icon for the calendar application, as illustrated in FIG. 3D.  The window manager may also modify a transformation for the root layer (or the icon layer 351) for a location to place the icon within the home screen 300.  The
window manager may render another frame of the video for the home screen 300 based on the modified multi-layered-tree 320.  FIG. 3E illustrates the home screen 300 rendered in response to the user's dismissal of the calendar's graphical user interface
200.  The home screen 300 illustrated in FIG. 3E may include a selectable icon 345 for the calendar application and other two-dimensional items as rendered based on the modified multi-layered-tree 320 illustrated in FIG. 3D.  As described above, the
overall user interface of the computing device (e.g., a home screen) may be represented as a multi-layered-tree associated with a window manager, while each of graphical user interfaces of software applications on the computing device may be represented
as a sub-tree with its root being a child of the overall multi-layered-tree associated with the window manager.  As the overall multi-layered-tree structure is recursive, the window manager may treat each sub-tree as a video itself, in addition to
treating the overall multi-layered-tree as another video (e.g., for the home screen).  That is, the window manager may render a frame of a video for a software application's graphical user interface based on a change to a corresponding sub-tree (e.g., in
response to an input or output event associated with the software application).  The window manager may also render a frame of a video for the home screen based on a change to the overall multi-layered-tree.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a multi-layered-tree representing a graphical user interface of a software application on the computing device (or a home screen of the computing device) may be constructed with one or more structured documents.  The
computing device may render a frame of a video for the graphical user interface based on the multi-layered-tree by using a layout engine.  A layout engine (or web browser engine) is a software component or library for rendering structured documents in a
graphical user interface.  For example, Google's Chrome web browser and Apple's Safari web browser use WebKit software to render web pages.  WebKit includes a layout engine WebCore and a JavaScript engine JavaScriptCore (for interpreting and executes
JavaScript code).  An application (or an operating system) running on the computing device may utilize a layout engine to render structured documents by incorporating modules in the layout engine via an application programming interface (API) to the
layout engine.  As illustrated in FIGS. 3A to 3E, an entire graphical display (e.g., the home screen 300) of the computing device may be represented by a multi-layered-tree associated with a window manager of the display.  Each of graphical user
interfaces of software applications on the computing device may be represented as a (sub-)multi-layered-tree with its root being a child of the multi-layered-tree associated with the window manager.  That is, the window manager (or another process
running on the computing device) may treat a software application's graphical user interface as an ordinary HTML element (e.g., as an HTML &lt;video&gt; element).  The window manager may also treat a software application's graphical user interface as a
basic building block for a particular graphical user interface system being used (e.g., View for Android operating system provided by Google, Inc., UIView for iOS operating system provided by Apple, Inc., NSView for OS X operating system provided by
Apple, Inc., window for Microsoft Windows operating system provided by Microsoft Corporation, or QWidget for Qt application framework originally developed by Nokia Oyj).  The window manager may create animations or videos for the entire graphical display
using one animation system (e.g., CSS).  In another embodiment, the computing device may render a graphical user interface of a software application on the computing device (or a home screen of the computing device) as frames of a MPEG-4 video (or a
video in any suitable compression-decompression format such as QuickTime format provided by Apple, Inc.  or Windows Media Video format provided by Microsoft Corporation).
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may repeat one or more steps of the method of FIG. 1, where appropriate.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of FIG. 1 as occurring in a particular order, this disclosure
contemplates any suitable steps of the method of FIG. 1 occurring in any suitable order.  Moreover, although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components, devices, or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of FIG. 1, this
disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components, devices, or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates an example method 400 for de-coupling an input associated with a graphical user interface from a corresponding output.  The method 400 may be implemented by a computing device with a display.  For example, the method 400 may
be implemented by one or more processes or computing threads executing on one or more processors of the computing device.  The method 400 may begin at step 410.  In particular embodiments, at step 410, a first thread of execution on a computing device
may receive a user-interface input.  For example, a user-interface input may comprise a user-input event, timer event, network event, or navigation event.  In particular embodiments, the first thread may be associated with a user interface of the
computing device.  The user interface may be an operating system shell on the computing device.  For example, the first thread may be associated with a window manager that manages a graphical user interface of an operating system shell (i.e., a home
screen) of the computing device.  The user interface may be a user interface of a software application on the computing device.  For example, the first thread may be associated with a window manager that manages a graphical user interface of a software
application on the computing device.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, at step 420, the first thread of execution on the computing device may identify a second thread of execution on the computing device to process the user-interface input.  In particular embodiments, at step 430, the
first thread of execution on the computing device may send the user-interface input to the second thread of execution.  In particular embodiments, at step 440, the second thread of execution on the computing device may process the user-interface input to
generate a user-interface output associated with the user-interface input.  For example, a user-interface output may comprise a graphics-output event (e.g., rendering a web page), network event, keyboard request, or navigation event.  The second thread
of execution may be associated with an event-driven software application.  In particular embodiments, the second thread may be associated with the user interface.  However, the second thread may be de-coupled from the first thread.  That is, the first
thread may not have to wait for processing the user-interface input by the second thread.  The execution of the first thread may not be stopped if the second thread is non-responsive (e.g., in processing the user-interface input).  Furthermore, in
particular embodiments, if the second thread is non-responsive with respect to the user-interface input, the first thread (or another process or computing thread) may provide an indication through the user interface of the non-responsiveness.
<br/><br/> For example, the first thread may be a computing thread of the window manager managing the home screen 300 illustrated in FIG. 3C described earlier.  The window manager may receive a user-interface input in a touch event indicated by the arrow
illustrated in FIG. 3C.  As described earlier, the touch event is a flick touch gesture by a user to dismiss the graphical user interface 200 of an calendar application.  The window manager may identify a second thread (de-coupled from the first thread)
to process the touch event.  The second thread may be another computing thread of the window manager spun off by the first thread.  The first thread may send the touch event to the second thread.  The second thread may process the touch event by
generating the home screen 300 (a user-interface output) illustrated in FIG. 3E.  The second thread may also cause the operating system of the computing device to stop execution of the calendar application (or to execute the calendar application with a
background process).  If the second thread is not responsive to the touch event (e.g., if the execution of the calendar application is hang or frozen), the first thread may provide a visual indication such as dimming the graphical user interface 200 of
the calendar application, as illustrated in FIG. 3F.  Here, since the second thread is de-coupled from the first thread, the non-responsiveness of the second thread may not block execution of the first thread (or the window manager).
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the first thread of execution may send the user-interface input to the second thread of execution by sending the user-interface input to a buffer (e.g., a software buffer) associated with the second thread of
execution.  The buffer may be configured to store the user-interface input for the second thread of execution while the second thread of execution processes other input (or is non-responsive).  For example, in the example of the touch event (of a user's
flick touch gesture) illustrated in FIG. 3C describer above, the user may just added a new appointment before dismissing the calendar application.  The first thread may send the second thread the touch event while the second thread is processing the new
appointment (e.g. instructing the calendar application to store the new appointment in a remote server).  The first thread may send the touch event to a buffer associated with the second thread.  After completing processing the new appointment, the
second thread may look up the buffer for a next task (e.g., dismissing the calendar application), and process the next task (and clear the task from the buffer).
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the first thread of execution may assigns a sequence number to the user-interface input identifying its position in a sequence of user-interface inputs.  For example, in the example of the touch event (of a user's
flick touch gesture) illustrated in FIG. 3C describer above, the flick touch gesture includes three touch inputs: a touch-down input, a touch-move input, and a touch-up input.  The first thread may assign sequence numbers 101, 102, and 103 to the
touch-down input, the touch-move input, and the touch-up input, respectively.  The first thread may send the three touch inputs with corresponding sequence numbers to a buffer associated with the second thread.  The second thread may interpret a first
user input with the earliest sequence number in the buffer (e.g., the touch-down input with the sequence number 101).  The second thread may recognize the first user input (e.g., as a tap touch gesture) and process the first user input accordingly (and
clear the first user input from the buffer).  The second thread may also clear out the second and third user inputs from the buffer, as the second thread is not interested in them any more.  That is, not all user-interface inputs stored in the buffer are
consumed.  The second thread may interpret the first user input with one or more additional user inputs stored in the buffer.  For example, the second thread may interpret the first three user inputs in the buffer (e.g., the touch-down input 101, the
touch-move input 102, and the touch-up input 103).  The second thread (or the calendar application) may recognize the first three inputs combined as a flick touch gesture, and process the flick touch gesture accordingly (e.g., dismissing the graphical
user interface 200 from the home screen 300).  The second thread may also clear the first three input events from the buffer.  In other embodiments, the first thread (e.g., the window manager) may interpret user-interface inputs with sequence numbers. 
For example, the first thread may interpret the first input 101 (the touch-down input) described above as a tap touch gesture for the calendar application, and send the tap touch gesture to the calendar application for processing.  The first thread may
also discard the second and third inputs 102 and 103 (the touch-move and the touch-up inputs).  Or the first thread may interpret the inputs 101, 102 and 103 as a flick touch gesture for the calendar application, and send the flick touch gesture to the
calendar application for processing.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the first thread (the window manager) may vary a size of the buffer associated with the second thread based on processing or acknowledgement latency associated with the second thread.  For example, the first thread may
increase the buffer size if the buffer is full (e.g., due to non-responsiveness of the second thread).  The first thread may also provide a visual indication (such as dimming a corresponding graphical user interface illustrated in FIG. 3F) that the
second thread (an application associated with the second thread) is not responsive.  The first thread may also throttle the rate or quality at which the first thread send events to the second thread such that the overall latency for the entire user
interface (e.g., the home screen) may be lessened.
<br/><br/> The method 100 and the method 400 may provide a flexible implementation of a graphical user interface that is always responsive.  For example, a first computing thread of a software application (or an operating system) on a computing device may
post a touchscreen keyboard (a graphical user interface of a keyboard application) in the computing device's touchscreen.  The touchscreen keyboard may be represented by a child multi-layered-tree of a multi-layered-tree representation of a home screen
of the computing device.  Since the touchscreen keyboard may be represented as an ordinary HTML element (not a window within another application's window), the touchscreen keyboard may be placed anywhere within the home screen and may overlap with a
graphical user interface of any other software application on the computing device.  In response to a touch input by a user on the touchscreen keyboard, the first thread may identify a second computing thread to process the user input (e.g., a thread
associated with another software application on the computing device).  Since the second thread is de-coupled from the first thread, the touchscreen keyboard may be always responsive to additional user touch inputs, even if the second thread is
none-responsive to a first user input.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may repeat one or more steps of the method of FIG. 4, where appropriate.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of FIG. 4 as occurring in a particular order, this disclosure
contemplates any suitable steps of the method of FIG. 4 occurring in any suitable order.  Moreover, although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components, devices, or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of FIG. 4, this
disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components, devices, or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of FIG. 4.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates an example computer system 500.  In particular embodiments, one or more computer systems 500 perform one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein.  In particular embodiments, one or more computer
systems 500 provide functionality described or illustrated herein.  In particular embodiments, software running on one or more computer systems 500 performs one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein or provides

computer system, a system-on-chip (SOC), a single-board computer system (SBC) (such as, for example, a computer-on-module (COM) or system-on-module (SOM)), a desktop computer system, a laptop or notebook computer system, an interactive kiosk, a
mainframe, a mesh of computer systems, a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a server, a tablet computer system, or a combination of two or more of these.  Where appropriate, computer system 500 may include one or more computer systems
500; be unitary or distributed; span multiple locations; span multiple machines; span multiple data centers; or reside in a cloud, which may include one or more cloud components in one or more networks.  Where appropriate, one or more computer systems
500 may perform without substantial spatial or temporal limitation one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein.  As an example and not by way of limitation, one or more computer systems 500 may perform in real time or in
batch mode one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein.  One or more computer systems 500 may perform at different times or at different locations one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein,
where appropriate.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, computer system 500 includes a processor 502, memory 504, storage 506, an input/output (I/O) interface 508, a communication interface 510, and a bus 512.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates a particular
computer system having a particular number of particular components in a particular arrangement, this disclosure contemplates any suitable computer system having any suitable number of any suitable components in any suitable arrangement.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, processor 502 includes hardware for executing instructions, such as those making up a computer program.  As an example and not by way of limitation, to execute instructions, processor 502 may retrieve (or fetch) the
