       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> Disclosed is an autonomous neighborhood vehicle controllable through a
     neighborhood social network. In one embodiment, an autonomous
     neighborhood vehicle can autonomously navigate to a destination specified
     by a user of the neighborhood social network. In one embodiment, a
     computer system of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle is communicatively
     coupled to the neighborhood social network through a wireless network to
     autonomously navigate to a destination specified by the user of the
     neighborhood social network. A navigation server provides a remote
     sensing capability to the autonomous neighborhood vehicle. A particular
     user of a third-party application is authenticated as being a verified
     user of the neighborhood social network having a verified residential
     address. An information of the particular user is communicated to the
     third-party application from the neighborhood social network based on a
     personal address privacy preference of the particular user.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> A method, apparatus, and system of multi-occupant structure in a geo-spatial environment are disclosed.  In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough
understanding of the various embodiments.  It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1A shows an autonomous neighborhood vehicle.  Particularly, FIG. 1A shows the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, a storage compartment 101, a sensor system 102, a user interface 104, an electronic locking mechanism 106, a telescoping
platform 107, a path lighting device 108, an all-terrain wheels 109, an ejection module 110, and a sidewalk detection sensor 111.  In one embodiment, may be an electric and/or battery powered device.  A propulsion system 208 (shown in FIG. 2) of the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 (e.g., driverless delivery vehicle, autonomous neighborhood delivery rover) may be powered by solar and/or wind power, according to one embodiment.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle may be a
wheeled vehicle, a treaded vehicle, an aerial vehicle, and/or an aquatic vehicle.
<br/><br/> The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may comprise of a set of wheels aligned in a way to provide the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 (e.g., neighborhood rover vehicle) stability when traveling to and/or from destinations (e.g., on
sidewalks, bike lanes, a roadway, over rocks, over grass).  The storage compartment 101 may be any shape that enables the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to adequately store desired item(s) 4502 (e.g., a rectangular shape, a spherical shape, a cone
shape).  The storage compartment 101 may be made of metallic materials, wood, and/or a polymer based material.  The interior of the storage compartment may be temperature controlled via the temperature control module 246 (e.g., heated, cooled, kept at a
certain humidity) and/or may be comprised of (e.g., be made of, lined with, reinforced with, padded with) materials to aid in transport and/or storage of items 4502.  In one embodiment, the storage compartment 101 may be lined with vinyl, nylon and/or
Cordura to aid in keeping contents heated.  In another embodiment, the storage compartment 101 may be padded and/or be equipped with a suspensions system to protect fragile contents.  The contents may be a gastronomical item, a perishable item, a retail
good, an electronic device, a piece of mail, an organ (e.g., for medical use), and/or any item capable of being transported via the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.
<br/><br/> The storage compartment 101 may have compartments (e.g., separate sections capable of being maintained at different temperatures and/or humidity, trays, compartmentalized areas) and/or may have separate openings on the surface of the storage
compartment 101 for each compartment(s).  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may comprise of an ejection module 110, according to one embodiment.  The ejection module 110 may be communicatively couple with a camera (e.g., a separate camera from that
of a sensor system 102) and/or may eject items 4502 (e.g., packages, letters, non-fragile items) from the storage compartment 101 using pressurized air.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may be able to eject items 4502 in a
specific compartment of the storage compartment 101 while not ejecting items 4502 in another compartment and/or keeping other items 4502 controlled at a certain temperature and/or humidity.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the sensor system 102 may be comprised of several sensors (e.g., several types, several of the same kind).  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may possess multiple sensor systems 102.  The sensor system 102 may be
physically associated with the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 so that the vehicle is able to capture and/or analyze its surrounding environment and/or navigate.  The sensor system 102 may be comprised of a global positioning system 218, an internal
measurement unit 220, a radar unit 222, a laser rangefinder/LIDAR unit 224, a camera 226, and/or an ultrasound unit 228 (e.g., as described in FIG. 2).
<br/><br/> The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may have a user interface 104 physically associated with it.  The user interface 104 may be a touch screen system, a key-pad based system, an audio based system (e.g., voice command), etc. The user
interface 104 may enable individuals (e.g., a user of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100) to enter commands (e.g., a destination, a set of details about the pick-up and/or drop-off, a set of constraints for the vehicle's operation).  In one
embodiment, the user interface 104 may require a user verification (e.g., passcode, voice recognition, a biometric scan) before access to the user interface 104 may be granted.  In another embodiment, the user interface 104 may be covered and/or encased
by a protective surface until activated (e.g., unlocked) for use.
<br/><br/> An electronic locking mechanism 106 may be physically associated with the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, according to one embodiment.  The electronic locking mechanism 106 may be a combination lock, an electronic lock, a signal based lock,
a passcode lock, a biometric scanner (e.g., fingerprint reader) and/or may keep the contents of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 secure.  In one embodiment, the electronic locking mechanism 106 may be unlocked and/or locked via the user interface
104.  In one embodiment, the electronic locking mechanism 106 may automatically unlock when the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 arrives at its destination.  The electronic locking mechanism 106 may unlock when the sender (e.g., owner, user) of the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 remotely unlocks the electronic locking mechanism 106 (e.g., using a data processing system 4204 (e.g., a smart phone, a tablet, a mobile device, a computer, a laptop).  In another embodiment, a passcode may be sent to
the recipient (e.g., store, individual, company) (e.g., via text message, via a push notification, via an update on a profile, in an email, etc.).  The passcode to the electronic locking mechanism 106 may be changed on a predetermined basis (e.g., with
every use, daily, weekly, hourly, upon request of the owner, upon request of the user (e.g., sender)).  In one embodiment, the electronic locking mechanism 106 may be unlocked using a near-field communication technology such as iBeacon, NFC and/or a
keypad unlock code.
<br/><br/> The path lighting device 108 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may automatically active a set of light emitting diodes encompassing the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 when a light sensor detects that an environmental brightness is
below a threshold lumens.  The path lighting device 108 may be comprised of multiple light sources.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may have multiple path lighting devices 108.
<br/><br/> The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may have all terrain wheels 109.  The all terrain wheels 109 may be shock absorbing, on/off road, airless, puncture-sealing, run-flat etc. The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may have a sidewalk
detection sensor 111 to provide a mechanism through which the autonomous neighborhood vehicle is able to detect a gradation ride caused by a sidewalk start location and a gradation drop caused by a sidewalk end location (e.g., curb).  The sidewalk
detection sensor 111 may be a LIDAR, a RADAR, a setero optical sensor, an ultrasound unit 228, and/or another type of sensor.  The telescoping platform 107 may enable the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to traverse the sidewalk (e.g., move from the
sidewalk to the road (e.g., bike lane) and/or from the road to the sidewalk) without disturbing, damaging and/or shifting its contents.  The telescoping platform 107 is better described in FIGS. 43A and 43b.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1B is a neighborhood view 151 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 traveling on a sidewalk while making a delivery in an environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152.  Particularly, FIG. 1B shows a sidewalk 112, a roadway
114, a claimable residential addresses 115, an environmental brightness 117, and a set of weather conditions.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may travel along sidewalks 112, bike lanes, and/or roadways 114.  These paths, along
with other possible routes of travel through the neighborhood, may be mapped (e.g., input to the global positioning system 218, input to the computer system 200, by transporting the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 through the neighborhood previously
in order to create a map via the sensor system 102) on and/or by the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  In one embodiment, the sidewalk detection sensor 111 may scan the path of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and may detect that the sidewalk
112 is ending.  The telescoping platform 107 may allow any number of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle's 100 wheels to be lowered and/or raised independent of the other wheels.  In one embodiment, as the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 approached
the end of a sidewalk 112, the front set of wheels may by lowered off the curb to meet the roadway 114 below as the rear wheels remain on the sidewalk 112.  The rear set of wheels may then be lowered from the sidewalk 112 to the roadway 114 as the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 moves from the sidewalk 112 to the roadway 114.  Once the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 is completely on the roadway 114, all wheels may be returned to their original positions.  This way, the autonomous
neighborhood vehicle 100 may be able to seamlessly transition from the roadway 114 to the sidewalk 112 and/or from the sidewalk 112 to the roadway 114.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a functional block diagram 250 illustrating an autonomous neighborhood vehicle, according to an example embodiment.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could be configured to operate fully or partially in an autonomous mode.  For
example, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could control itself while in the autonomous mode, and may be operable to determine a current state of the vehicle and its environment, determine a predicted behavior of at least one other entity (e.g.,
vehicle, pedestrian, biker, animal) in the environment, determine a confidence level that may correspond to a likelihood of the at least one other vehicle to perform the predicted behavior, and/or control the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 based on
the determined information (described in FIGS. 3A-C).  While in autonomous mode, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may be configured to operate without human interaction.

autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may include more or fewer subsystems and each subsystem could include multiple elements.  Further, each of the subsystems and elements of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could be interconnected.  Thus, one or more
of the described functions of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may be divided up into additional functional or physical components, or combined into fewer functional or physical components.  In some further examples, additional functional and/or
physical components may be added to the examples illustrated by FIG. 2.

engine/motor 210 and, in turn, control the speed of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  The brake unit 236 could include any combination of mechanisms configured to decelerate the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  The brake unit 236 could use
friction to slow the wheels/tires 216.  In other embodiments, the brake unit 136 could convert the kinetic energy of the wheels/tires 216 to electric current.  The brake unit 236 may take other forms as well.
<br/><br/> The sensor fusion algorithm 238 may be an algorithm (or a computer program product storing an algorithm) configured to accept data from the sensor system 102 as an input.  The data may include, for example, data representing information sensed
at the sensors of the sensor system 102.  The sensor fusion algorithm 238 could include, for instance, a Kalman filter, Bayesian network, or other algorithm.  The sensor fusion algorithm 238 could further provide various assessments based on the data
from sensor system 102.  Depending upon the embodiment, the assessments could include evaluations of individual objects and/or features in the environment of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, evaluation of a particular situation, and/or evaluate
possible impacts based on the particular situation.  In one embodiment, the sensor fusion algorithm may determine that a sidewalk is ending and/or beginning (e.g., by sensing a curb).  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle may be able to adjust its path to
avoid and/or intersect with the curb and/or sidewalk (e.g., traversing the curb to move from a bike lane to a sidewalk or vice versa).  Other assessments are possible.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may be able to use the sensor fusion
algorithm 238 to use multiple sources of data to navigate intersections (e.g., while turning in an intersection) without use of lanes, painted lines, demarcated paths etc.
<br/><br/> The computer vision system 240 may be any system operable to process and analyze images captured by camera 226 in order to identify objects and/or features in the environment of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 that could include traffic
signals, road way boundaries, and obstacles.  The computer vision system 240 could use an object recognition algorithm, a Structure From Motion (SFM) algorithm, video tracking, and other computer vision techniques.  In some embodiments, the computer
vision system 240 could be additionally configured to map an environment, track objects, estimate the speed of objects, etc. The navigation and pathing system 242 may be any system configured to determine a driving path for the autonomous neighborhood
vehicle 100.  The navigation and pathing system 242 may additionally be configured to update the driving path dynamically while the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 is in operation.  In some embodiments, the navigation and pathing system 242 could be
configured to incorporate data from the sensor fusion algorithm 238, the GPS 218, and one or more predetermined maps so as to determine the driving path for autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  The obstacle avoidance system 244 could represent a control
system configured to identify, evaluate, and avoid or otherwise negotiate potential obstacles (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles, bicycles, sidewalks (e.g., curbs, paved sidewalks), traffic cones, downed tree branches) in the environment of the autonomous
neighborhood vehicle 152.  The control system 230 may additionally or alternatively include components other than those shown and described.
<br/><br/> Peripherals 248 may be configured to allow interaction between the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and external sensors, other vehicles, other computer systems, and/or a user.  For example, Peripherals 248 could include a wireless
communication system 250, the user interface 104, a microphone 254, a speaker 256, the path lighting device 108, and/or the ejection module 110.  The path lighting device may include a set of light emitting diodes 270 and/or a light sensor 272 to detect
that an environmental brightness is below a threshold luminosity.  The speaker 1352 may play a message recorded (e.g., through the microphone 254 and/or a mobile device and/or computer that sends the message to the autonomous neighborhood vehicle).  The
microphone 254 may pick up and/or record noise from the autonomous neighborhood vehicle's environment.  The speaker 256 may play the message (e.g., instructions to an individual at a destination (e.g., an order)) and/or announce actions of the autonomous
neighborhood vehicle 100 (e.g., announce that the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 is about to make a left turn and/or break).  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may have one or more turn signals and/or break lights.
<br/><br/> The speaker 256, microphone 254, and/or the wireless communication system 250 (e.g., working in concert) may record and/or play an audio message (e.g., from the sender to the recipient and/or vice versa) recorded on the autonomous neighborhood
vehicle 100 itself and/or sent to the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 from the commerce server 4200 through the network.  The wireless communication system 250 may enable the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to communicate through the network with
other autonomous neighborhood vehicles 100 (e.g., in the network, within a threshold radial distance 4219, owned by the same owner, sent by the same sender, sent to the same recipient).  In one embodiment, this communication may be used to maximize
efficiency of routes, coordinate and/or ensure timely delivery, to form a convoy etc.
<br/><br/> In an example embodiment, the Peripherals 248 could provide, for instance, means for a user of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to interact with the user interface 104.  To this end, the user interface 104 could provide information to a
user of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  The user interface 104 could also be operable to accept input from the user via a touchscreen.  The touchscreen may be configured to sense at least one of a position and a movement of a user's finger via
capacitive sensing, resistance sensing, or a surface acoustic wave process, among other possibilities.  The touchscreen may be capable of sensing finger movement in a direction parallel or planar to the touchscreen surface, in a direction normal to the
touchscreen surface, or both, and may also be capable of sensing a level of pressure applied to the touchscreen surface.  The touchscreen may be formed of one or more translucent or transparent insulating layers and one or more translucent or transparent
conducting layers.  The touchscreen may take other forms as well.
<br/><br/> In other instances, the Peripherals 248 may provide means for the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to communicate with devices within its environment.  The microphone 254 may be configured to receive audio (e.g., a voice command or other
audio input) from a user of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  Similarly, the speakers 256 may be configured to output audio to the user of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  The ejection module 110 may be coupled with a camera and/or may
enable the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to eject item(s) 4502 using pressurized air (e.g., deliver packages to a door step without leaving the sidewalk 112.
<br/><br/> In one example, the wireless communication system 250 could be configured to wirelessly communicate with one or more devices directly or via a communication network.  For example, wireless communication system 250 could use 3G cellular
communication, such as CDMA, EVDO, GSM/GPRS, or 4G cellular communication, such as WiMAX or LTE.  Alternatively, wireless communication system 250 could communicate with a wireless local area network (WLAN), for example, using WiFi.  In some embodiments,
wireless communication system 250 could communicate directly with a device, for example, using an infrared link, Bluetooth, or ZigBee.  Other wireless protocols, such as various vehicular communication systems, are possible within the context of the
disclosure.  For example, the wireless communication system 250 could include one or more dedicated short range communications (DSRC) devices that could include public and/or private data communications between vehicles and/or roadside stations.  The
wireless communication system 250 may also enable the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to communicate and/or coordinate with other autonomous neighborhood vehicles 100.
<br/><br/> The power supply 258 may provide power to various components of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and could represent, for example, a rechargeable lithium-ion, lithium-sulfur, or lead-acid battery.  In some embodiments, one or more banks of
such batteries could be configured to provide electrical power.  Other power supply materials and configurations are possible.  In some embodiments, the power supply 258 and energy source 212 could be implemented together, as in some all-electric cars. 
In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may autonomously direct itself to a charging station (e.g., a set non-transitory charging stations, a nearest charging station, a nearest preapproved (e.g., claimed) charging station) and/or
conduct necessary operations to charge itself when an energy supply reaches a threshold level, at a certain time of day, when a certain amount of time has elapsed, when a certain distance has been traveled etc.
<br/><br/> Many or all of the functions of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 (e.g., the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100) could be controlled by computer system 200.  Computer system 200 may include at least one processor 202 (which could include at
least one microprocessor) that executes instructions 206 stored in a non-transitory computer readable medium, such as the data storage 204.  The processor 202 may be communicatively coupled to the commerce server 4200 (shown in FIG. 42) of the
neighborhood communication system 2950 through a wireless network (e.g., the network of FIG. 42) to autonomously navigate the autonomous neighborhood vehicle (e.g., the neighborhood rover vehicle) to a destination specified by the commerce server 4200. 
The computer system 200 may also represent a plurality of computing devices that may serve to control individual components or subsystems of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 in a distributed fashion.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, data storage 204 may contain instructions 206 (e.g., program logic) executable by the processor 202 to execute various functions of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, including those described above in connection with FIG.
2.  Data storage 204 may contain additional instructions as well, including instructions to transmit data to, receive data from, interact with, and/or control one or more of the propulsion system 208, the sensor system 102, the control system 230, and
the Peripherals 248.  In addition to the instructions 206, the data storage 204 may store data such as roadway maps, path information, among other information.  Such information may be used by the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and computer system
200 at during the operation of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 in the autonomous, semi-autonomous, and/or manual modes.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may include a user interface 104 for providing information to or receiving input from
a user of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  The user interface 104 could control or enable control of content and/or the layout of interactive images that could be displayed on the touchscreen.  Further, the user interface 104 could include one
or more input/output devices within the set of Peripherals 248, such as the wireless communication system 250, the touchscreen, the microphone 254, and the speaker 256.
<br/><br/> The computer system 200 may control the function of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 based on inputs received from various subsystems (e.g., propulsion system 208, sensor system 102, and control system 230), as well as from the user
interface 104.  For example, the computer system 200 may utilize input from the control system 230 in order to control the steering unit 232 to avoid an obstacle detected by the sensor system 102 and the obstacle avoidance system 244.  Depending upon the
embodiment, the computer system 200 could be operable to provide control over many aspects of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and its subsystems.  The components of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could be configured to work in an
interconnected fashion with other components within or outside their respective systems.  For instance, in an example embodiment, the camera 226 could capture a plurality of images that could represent information about a state of an environment of the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152 operating in an autonomous mode.  The environment could include another vehicle.  The computer vision system 240 could recognize the other vehicle as such based on object recognition models stored in data storage 204.
<br/><br/> The computer system 200 could carry out several determinations based on the information.  For example, the computer system 200 could determine one or more predicted behaviors 305 of the other vehicle.  The predicted behavior could be based on
several factors including the current state of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 (e.g., vehicle speed, current lane, etc.) and the current state of the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152 (e.g., speed limit, number of available
lanes, position and relative motion of other vehicles, etc.).  For instance, in a first scenario, if another vehicle is rapidly overtaking the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 from a left-hand lane, while autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 is in a
center lane, one predicted behavior could be that the other vehicle will continue to overtake the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 from the left-hand lane.
<br/><br/> In a second scenario, if the other vehicle is overtaking autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 in the left-hand lane, but a third vehicle traveling ahead of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 is impeding further progress in the left-hand lane, a
predicted behavior could be that the other vehicle may cut in front of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  The computer system 200 could further determine a confidence level corresponding to each predicted behavior.  For instance, in the first
scenario, if the left-hand lane is open for the other vehicle to proceed, the computer system 200 could determine that it is highly likely that the other vehicle will continue to overtake autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and remain in the left-hand
lane.  Thus, the confidence level corresponding to the first predicted behavior (that the other vehicle will maintain its lane and continue to overtake) could be high, such as 90%.
<br/><br/> In the second scenario, where the other vehicle is blocked by a third vehicle, the computer system 200 could determine that there is a 50% chance that the other vehicle may cut in front of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 since the other
vehicle could simply slow and stay in the left-hand lane behind the third vehicle.  Accordingly, the computer system 200 could assign a 50% confidence level (or another signifier) to the second predicted behavior in which the other vehicle may cut in
front of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.
<br/><br/> In the example embodiment, the computer system 200 could work with data storage 204 and other systems in order to control the control system 230 based on at least on the predicted behavior, the confidence level, the current state of the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, and the current state of the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152.  In the first scenario, the computer system 200 may elect to adjust nothing as the likelihood (confidence level) of the other
vehicle staying in its own lane is high.  In the second scenario, the computer system 200 may elect to control autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to slow down slightly (by reducing throttle 234) or to shift slightly to the right (by controlling steering
unit 232) within the current lane in order to avoid a potential collision.  Other examples of interconnection between the components of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 are numerous and possible within the context of the disclosure.
<br/><br/> Although FIG. 2 shows various components of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, i.e., wireless communication system 250, computer system 200, data storage 204, and user interface 104, as being integrated into the autonomous neighborhood vehicle
100, one or more of these components could be mounted or associated separately from the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  For example, data storage 204 could, in part or in full, exist separate from the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  Thus, the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could be provided in the form of device elements that may be located separately or together.  The device elements that make up autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could be communicatively coupled together in a wired
and/or wireless fashion.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3A illustrates a scenario 350 involving the roadway 114 with a side of the road 300, an ability 303, and a bike lane 304.  An autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100B (e.g., an autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 shown in FIG. 43A) could be in
the bike lane 304.  An autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could be operating in an autonomous mode in the side of the road 300.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may have the ability to travel autonomously in a bike lane 304. 
The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100B could be travelling at the same speed.  Another bicyclist 302A could be in the bike lane 304 and approaching the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100B from behind at a
higher rate of speed.  The sensor system 102 (e.g., the LIDAR 108, the RADAR unit 222, the camera 226, an ultrasound unit 228) of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could be capturing sensor data based on an environment of the autonomous
neighborhood vehicle 100.
<br/><br/> Although the embodiment of FIG. 3A, the sensor system 102 is shown on the top of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, it should be appreciated that the sensor system 102 may be located internally, on the front, on the sides etc. of the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  In particular, the camera 226 could capture a plurality of images of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100B, the other bicyclist 302A, as well as other features in the environment so as to help the computer system
of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to determine the current state of the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152.  Other sensors associated with the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could be operable to provide the speed,
heading, location, and other data such that the computer system of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could determine the current state of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.
<br/><br/> Based upon the current state of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and the current state of the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152, the computer system in autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could further determine a
predicted behavior of at least one other autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 in the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152.  Within the context of FIG. 3A, a set of predicted behaviors 305A (e.g., a predicted behavior, a number of
predicted behaviors) may be determined for both autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100B and the other bicyclist 302A.  As the predicted behaviors 305 could be based on the current state of the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152, the
computer system of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could take into account factors such as the speed of the respective autonomous neighborhood vehicles 100, their headings, the roadway speed limit, and other available lanes, among other factors. 
In one embodiment, a change in speed 306 of the bicyclist 302A may be part of a criteria used to determine predicted behaviors 305A.
<br/><br/> For instance, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100B could have a predicted behavior of proceeding at the same speed, and within the same lane.  Depending on the embodiment, such a predicted behavior that maintains a `status quo` may be
considered a default predicted behavior.  Predicted behaviors 305A for the other bicyclist 302A could include the other bicyclist 302A slowing down to match the speed of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100B.  Alternatively, the other bicyclist 302A
could change lanes to the side of the road 300 or the other bicyclist 302A could change lanes to the side of the road 300 and cut off the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.
<br/><br/> Depending upon the embodiment and the situation, a wide variety of predicted behaviors 305 of other autonomous neighborhood vehicles 100 could be possible.  Possible predicted behaviors 305 could include, but are not limited to, other autonomous
neighborhood vehicles 100 changing lanes, accelerating, decelerating, changing heading, or vehicles exiting the roadway, merging into the side of the road 300 (e.g., to turn right off of the roadway 114).  Predicted behaviors 305 could also include other
entities (e.g., other autonomous neighborhood vehicles 100, other vehicles (e.g., cars), bicyclists, pedestrians, animals) pulling over due to an emergency situation, colliding with an obstacle, and colliding with another entity.  Predicted behaviors 305
could be based on what another entity may do in response to the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 or in response to a third entity (e.g., bicyclist).  Other predicted behaviors 305 could be determined that relate to any vehicle (e.g., autonomous
neighborhood vehicle, car, bicycle) driving behavior observable and/or predictable based on the methods and apparatus disclosed herein.
<br/><br/> For each predicted behavior or for a predetermined set of predicted behaviors 305, the computer system of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could determine corresponding confidence levels.  The confidence levels could be determined based on
the likelihood that the given entity (e.g., vehicle) will perform the given predicted behavior.  For instance, if the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100B is highly likely to perform the predicted behavior (staying in the current lane, maintaining
current speed), the corresponding confidence level could be determined to be high (e.g., 90%).  In some embodiments, the confidence level could be represented as a number, a percentage, or in some other form.  With respect to the other bicyclist 302A,
possible confidence levels could be expressed as follows: slowing down to match speed of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100B--40%, maintaining speed and staying in the bike lane 304--40%, maintaining speed and changing to side of the road 300--20%.
<br/><br/> The computer system could control autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 in the autonomous mode based on at least the determined predicted behaviors 305 and confidence levels.  For instance, the computer system could take into account the fact the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100B is highly unlikely to change its rate of speed or lane and as such, the computer system could consider autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100B as a `moving obstacle` that limits the drivable portion of the path for both
the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 as well as the other bicyclist 302A.  The computer system may further consider that there is some finite probability that the other bicyclist 302A will pull into the side of the road 300 and cut off the autonomous
neighborhood vehicle 100.  As such, the computer system may cause the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to slow down slightly, for instance by reducing the throttle, so as to allow a margin of safety if the other bicyclist 302A elects to cut in front.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3B illustrates a scenario 351 similar to that in FIG. 3A.  In scenario 351, a car 310B has changed its heading towards the side of the road 300 and has moved closer to the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  The computer system of
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may continuously update the state of the car 310B as well as its environment, for instance at a rate of thirty times per second.  Accordingly, the computer system may be dynamically determining predicted behaviors 305
and their corresponding confidence levels for car 310B in the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152.  In scenario 351, due at least in part to the changing environment, a new predicted behavior could be determined for car 310B.  In such
a situation, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may make way for the car 310B by slowing down.  Thus, the predicted behaviors 305 and corresponding confidence levels 307 could change dynamically.
<br/><br/> In scenario 351, the computer system of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could update the confidence level of the predicted behavior of the other vehicles (e.g., car 310B).  For instance, since the car 310B has changed its heading toward the
side of the road 300 and has moved nearer to the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, it may be determined that the car 310B is highly likely to change lanes into the side of the road 300 based on an observed change in angle 308 and/or a change in
direction 309, according to one embodiment.  Accordingly, based on the increased confidence level 307 of the predicted behavior of the car 310B, the computer system of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could control the brake unit to abruptly slow
the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 so as to avoid a collision with the car 310B.  As such, the computer system of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could carry out a range of different control actions in response to varying predicted behaviors
305B (e.g., a set of predicated behaviors) and their confidence levels.  For example, if another entity (e.g., a car, another autonomous neighborhood vehicle, an animal, a pedestrian) is predicted to behave very dangerously and such predicted behavior
has a high confidence level, the computer system of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could react by aggressively applying the brakes or steering the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 evasively to avoid a collision.
<br/><br/> Conversely, if the computer system determines that the other entity may carry out a predicted behavior that is very dangerous, but the confidence level is very low, the computer system may determine that only a minor adjustment in speed is
necessary or the computer system may determine that no adjustment is required.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may predict a collision between cars 310A and 310B.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle may be able to adjust its
speed and/or course to avoid being involved in the collision.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3C is a top view of an autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 operating scenario 352.  In scenario 352, an autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 with a sensor system 102 could be operating in an autonomous mode.  As such, the sensor system 102
could be obtaining data from the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152 and the computer system of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could be determining a current state of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and a current state
of the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152.
<br/><br/> Scenario 352 includes a bicyclist 302C traveling at the same speed and in the same bike lane 304 as the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  A bicyclist 302D could be traveling at a higher speed in the side of the road 300.  In such a
situation, the computer system of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could determine predicted behaviors 305C (e.g., a set of predicted behaviors) for the bicyclist 302C and bicyclist 302D.  The bicyclist 302D could continue at its current speed and
within its current lane.  Thus, a `default` predicted behavior could be determined.  For another possible predicted behavior, the bicyclist 302D may also change lanes into the bike lane 304 and cut off the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  The
computer system of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could determine a default predicted behavior for the bicyclist 302D (e.g., the bicyclist 302D will maintain present speed and lane).
<br/><br/> The computer system of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could determine confidence levels 307 for each predicted behavior.  For instance, the confidence level for the bicyclist 302C maintaining speed and the same lane could be relatively
high.  The confidence level of the bicyclist 302D to change lanes into the bike lane 304 and cut off the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could be determined to be relatively low, for instance, because the space between the bicyclist 302C and the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 is too small to safely execute a lane change.  Further, the confidence level of the bicyclist 302D maintaining its speed and its current lane may be determined to be relatively high, at least in part because the side
of the road 300 is clear ahead.  Thus, based on these predictions and confidence levels, the computer system of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could control the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to maintain its current speed and heading in bike
lane 304.  In one embodiment, a change in location 311 could be used to determine a confidence level for predicted behaviors 305.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a scan view 450 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  Particularly, FIG. 4 shows the sensor system 102 (e.g., the LIDAR 108, the RADAR unit 222, the camera 226, a stereo optic sensor, and/or an ultrasound unit 228), a
longitudinal axis, an angle .beta.  404, an angle .alpha.  406, an object 408, and a nature of the object 409.  To produce a three-dimensional (3D) image, in one embodiment of the present invention, the sensor system 102 may be panned (or oscillated) in,
along and/or out of the longitudinal axis to create a 3D scanning volume 410, as shown in FIG. 4.  For sake of illustration, FIG. 4 defines the scanning volume 410 by the angle .alpha.  404 (in the vertical scanning direction) and the angle .beta.  406
(in the horizontal scanning direction).  The angle .alpha.  404 may range from 30 to 70 degrees, at angular speeds ranging from 100-1000 degrees per second.  The angle .beta.  406 (i.e., the panning angle) may range from 1 to 270 degrees, at a panning
rate ranging from 1-150 degrees per second.  Combined the imaging sensor system 102 typically can completely scan the 3D scanning volume 410 at more than two times a second.
<br/><br/> In order to accurately determine the distance to objects in the 3D scanning volume 410, the direction that the sensor system 102 is pointed at the time of receiving light reflected from the objects 408 is needed (i.e., the angle of deflection
from the longitudinal axis 402 is needed).  Further, in one embodiment of the present invention, geospatial positional data of the instantaneous vehicle position is utilized by processor (e.g., the processor 202) to calculate based on the distance of the
object from the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and its direction from the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, the geospatial location of the objects in the field of view.  In one configuration of the present invention, the processor may include a
personal computer running on a Linux operating system, and the algorithms may be programmed in Java programming language.  Other computing systems and programming languages can be used in the present invention.  The processor (e.g., the processor 202)
may be communicatively coupled with a real time positioning device, such as for example the global positioning system (GPS) 218 and/or the internal measurement unit 1324, that transmits the location, heading, altitude, and speed of the vehicle multiple
times per second to processor.  The real time positioning device may typically be mounted to the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and may transmit data (such as location, heading, altitude, and speed of the vehicle) to all imaging sensors (e.g., other
LIDAR, radar, ultrasound units 228 and/or cameras) (and all processors) on the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.
<br/><br/> With commercially available GPS and the INS units, processor objects 102 may be able to determine a position of an object in the field of view to an accuracy of better than 10 cm.  In one embodiment of the present invention, the processor 202
may correlate GPS position, LADAR measurements, and/or angle of deflection data to produce a map of obstacles in a path of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  The accuracy of the map may depend on the accuracy of the data from the positioning
device (e.g., the global positioning system 218).  The following are illustrative examples of the accuracies of such data: position 10 cm, forward velocity 0.07 km/hr, acceleration 0.01%, roll/pitch 0.03 degrees, heading 0.1 degrees, lateral velocity
0.2%.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the present invention, a Kalman filter (commercially integrated) sorts through all data inputs to the processor (e.g., the processor 202).  A Kalman filter is a known method of estimating the state of a system based upon
recursive measurement of noisy data.  In this instance, the Kalman filter is able to much more accurately estimate vehicle position by taking into account the type of noise inherent in each type of sensor and then constructing an optimal estimate of the
actual position.  Such filtering is described by A. Kelly, in "A 3d State Space Formulation of a Navigation Kalman Filter for Autonomous Vehicles," CMU Robotics Institute, Tech. Rep., 1994, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by
reference.  The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error.  The filter is very powerful in several
aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown.
<br/><br/> The positioning device, by including GPS and/or INS data, may be able to provide complementary data to the processor.  GPS and INS may have reciprocal errors.  That is GPS may be noisy with finite drift, while INS may not be noisy but may have
infinite drift.  Further, the processor may be configured to accept additional inputs (discussed below) to reduce drift in its estimate of vehicle position when, for example the GPS data may not be available.  The nature of the object 409 may include its
size, shape, position and/or identity.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5A is a multi scan view 550 of the autonomous neighborhood autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 100 according to the present invention depicting one embodiment in which multiple sensors systems 102 (e.g., LIDAR, radar, ultrasound, and/or
camera(s)) are used.  In this embodiment, one or more of the imaging sensors (e.g., sensor systems 306) is dedicated to scanning for the detection of objects 408 nearby the autonomous neighborhood autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 100 (e.g., within 50
m) while another of the imaging sensors is dedicated to scanning for the detection of objects farther away from the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 (e.g., beyond 50 m).
<br/><br/> In another embodiment of the invention, multiple imaging sensors are used for redundancy and to provide different perspectives of the same object.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may determine that an alternate field
of view is needed.  For example, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may come to an intersection.  However, a car may block the autonomous neighborhood vehicle's 100 ability to gain a view of the intersection to the right.  As the autonomous
neighborhood vehicle may plan to make a left turn, it must be aware of a traffic flow 5210 (shown in FIG. 52) coming from the right.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may prioritize its established constraints (e.g., the minimum crosswalk stopping
distance, the envelope 900, the magnitude of deceleration).  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may determine an optimal alternate field of view that does not violate established constraints prioritized above obtaining the alternate field of view. 
Achieving this alternate field of view may include moving (rotating, shifting) sensors and/or moving the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, according to one environment.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5A shows an alternate field of view 502 and an optimal alternate field of view 504.  In an example embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may arrive at a stop sign 5206 at an intersection 5200.  A car in a next lane may block
the view of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may require the blocked view in order to assess a traffic flow 5210 before continuing along the route.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle may determine that
an alternate field of view 502 is required.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle may identify a number of alternative fields of view 502 and/or select the alternate field of view that is most efficient at capturing the desired field of view, requires the
least amount of time and/or effort to attain, and/or does not violate constraints that have been prioritized above attaining the alternative field of view 502 (e.g., maintaining an envelope 900).  The optimal alternate field of view may be that which
satisfies on or more of the above mentioned criteria.  In the embodiment of FIG. 5A, the alternate field of view 502 and the optimal alternate field of view 504 are the same.  It should be appreciated that this may not always be the case.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5B is a multi scan view 551 of an autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 according to the present invention depicting one embodiment in which multiple imaging sensors systems 102 are used to scan the same or overlapping fields of view.  This
configuration may provide redundant coverage in the center of the path so that, if one imaging sensor (e.g., the sensor system 102) fails, the other one can still sense obstacles most likely to be directly in the autonomous neighborhood vehicle's 100
path.  The data from the imaging sensors may be correlated by placing all data onto the same elevation grid.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the imaging sensors may be configured to locate objects removed from a autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100; and processor (e.g., a sensor processor 600 shown in FIG. 6, the processor 202 and/or the processor 202) may be
configured to direct one of the sensors to scan a first sector associated with a path of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, while directing another of the sensors to scan a second sector identified with an obstacle (e.g., the object 408).  As such,
the first and/or second sector determinations can be based on a number of factors including, but not limited to a autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 speed, an identified obstacle location, a projected path of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, a
resolution required to resolve a complex obstacle or a collection of obstacles to be resolved, sensory input other than from the sensors, an identified priority sector in which an obstacle has been identified, and auxiliary information indicating the
presence of an obstacle (e.g., the object 408), a moving obstacle (e.g., a car, a pedestrian, a bike, and/or an animal), another autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, a landmark, or an area of interest.
<br/><br/> In one variant of this embodiment, the processor (e.g., the sensor processor 600 shown in FIG. 6, the processor 202 shown in FIG. 2) can direct one sensor to scan (using an angle .alpha.  404A, an angle .alpha.  404B, an angle .beta.  406A,
an/or an angle .beta.  406B as described in FIG. 4) a first sector associated with a path of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, and in a programmed manner direct the same sensor (e.g., in a dynamic fashion) to scan a second sector identified with
an object 408.  Factors which determine the programmed duty cycle by which one sensor scans the first sector and then a second sector include for example the speed of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, the proximity of the obstacle (e.g., the
object 408), any movement of the obstacle, an identified status of the obstacle (e.g., friend or foe), the proximity of the obstacle to the projected path of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, and the calculated clearance from the autonomous
neighborhood vehicle 100 to the obstacle.
<br/><br/> Moreover, in one embodiment of the present invention, one of the imaging sensors (e.g., sensor systems 306) is dedicated to scanning in a horizontal direction while another imaging sensor is directed to scan in the vertical direction.  Scan
information from this unit permits the processor to better identify the general terrain and terrain curvature from which obstacles can be identified.  Complementary data from both horizontal and vertical scans helps identity the edges of composite
obstacles (groups of individual obstacles that should be treated as one obstacle) more accurately.  One of the issues with handling moving obstacles is determining the full proportions of an obstacle.  To calculate the full proportions of an obstacle,
multiple "independent" obstacles are intelligently grouped to form one larger composite obstacle when for example the data points representing the independent objects 408 (e.g., obstacles) are within a set distance of each other (e.g., within 100 cm). 
Moreover, in other embodiments of the present invention, the grouping into composite obstacles is set by more than just a distance of separation between points normally qualifying as an obstacle point.  Other factors that can be used in the determination
include for example the number of times each point identified as an obstacle is seen, whether the obstacle point moves spatially in time, and whether (as discussed elsewhere) if there is confirmation of the obstacle by other image sensors or
stereographic cameras.
<br/><br/> Having two completely different perspectives of the obstacles facilitates this task by the obstacles being viewed from two separate dimensions (i.e., from top to bottom and from left to right).  Since the beams tend to wrap around the curvature
of an obstacle, this provides accurate estimations of the size and orientation of a composite obstacle.  For instance, consider a spherical boulder.  While the backside of the spherical boulder cannot be seen, the sensing beam maps out a contour of the
spherical boulder providing the aforementioned size and orientation, providing an estimate of the full size of the spherical boulder.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is an internal sensor system view 650 of the sensor system 102, according to one embodiment.  As shown in FIG. 6, the sensor system 102 includes a detector 604 for detecting return of an echoed signal.  The sensor system 102 utilizes a
sensor processor 600 for controlling the timing and emission of the laser pulses 601 and for correlating emission of the laser pulses 601 with reception of the echoed signal 20.  The sensor processor 600 may be on-board the autonomous neighborhood
vehicle 100 or a part of the sensor system 102.
<br/><br/> In an exemplary example, laser pulses 601 from emitter 602 pass through a beam expander 614 and a collimator 610.  The laser pulses 601 are reflected at a stationary mirror 612 to a rotating mirror 616 and then forwarded through lens 618 and a
telescope 620 to form a beam for the laser pulses 601 with a diameter of 1-10 mm, providing a corresponding resolution for the synthesized three-dimensional field of view.  The telescope 620 serves to collect light reflected from objects 22.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of the present invention, the detector 604 is configured to detect light only of a wavelength of the emitted light in order to discriminate the laser light reflected from the object back to the detector from background light. 
Accordingly, the sensor system 102 operates, in one embodiment of the present invention, by sending out a laser pulse that is reflected by an object 208 and measured by the detector 604 provided the object is within range of the sensitivity of the
detector 604.  The elapsed time between emission and reception of the laser pulse permits the sensor processor 600 is used to calculate the distance between the object 408 and the detector 604.  In one embodiment of the present invention, the optics
(e.g., the beam expander 614, the collimator 610, the rotating mirror 616, the stationary mirror 612, the lens 618, and the telescope 620) are configured to direct the beam instantaneously into a two-dimensional sector of a plane defined with respect to
the longitudinal axis 402, and the detector 604 is a field-programmable gate array for reception of the received signals at predetermined angular positions corresponding to a respective angular direction a.
<br/><br/> Via the rotating mirror 616, laser pulses 601 are swept through a radial sector a within plane defined with respect to the longitudinal axis 402.  In one embodiment of the present invention, in order to accomplish mapping of objects in the field
of view in front of the sensor system 102, the rotating mirror 616 is rotated across an angular displacement ranging from 30 to 90 degrees, at angular speeds ranging from 100-10000 degrees per second.  For example, a 90 degree scanning range can be
scanned 75 times per second or an 80 degree scanning range can be scanned between 5 and 100 times per second.  Furthermore, the angular resolution can be dynamically adjusted (e.g., providing on command angular resolutions of 0.01, 0.5, 0.75, or 1
degrees for different commercially available sensors (e.g., the sensor system 102, the LIDAR 108, the RADAR unit 222, the camera 226, and/or the ultrasound unit 228).
<br/><br/> Commercially available components can be used for the emitter 602 and the detector 604 to provide ranging measurements.  In one embodiment, the emitter 602, the detector 604, and the associated optics constitute a laser radar (LADAR) system, but
other systems capable of making precise distance measurements can be used in the present invention, such as for example a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor, a radar, or a camera.  LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging; or Laser Imaging Detection
and Ranging) is a technology that determines distance to an object or surface using laser pulses Like the similar radar technology, which uses radio waves instead of light, the range to an object is determined by measuring the time delay between
transmission of a pulse and detection of the reflected signal.  LADAR (Laser Detection and Ranging) refers to elastic backscatter LIDAR systems.  The term laser radar is also in use, but with laser radar laser light (and not radio waves) are used.
<br/><br/> The primary difference between LIDAR and radar may be that with LIDAR, much shorter wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum are used, typically in the ultraviolet, visible, or near infrared.  In general it is possible to image a feature or
object only about the same size as the wavelength, or larger.  Thus, LIDAR may provide more accurate mapping than radar systems.  Moreover, an object may need to produce a dielectric discontinuity in order to reflect the transmitted wave.  At radar
(microwave or radio) frequencies, a metallic object may produce a significant reflection.  However non-metallic objects, such as rain and rocks may produce weaker reflections, and some materials may produce no detectable reflection at all, meaning some
objects or features may be effectively invisible at radar frequencies.  Lasers may provide one solution to these problems.  The beam densities and coherency may be excellent.  Moreover the wavelengths may be much smaller than can be achieved with radio
systems, and range from about 10 micrometers to the UV (e.g., 250 nm).  At these wavelengths, a LIDAR system can offer much higher resolution than radar.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a detailed schematic illustration of sensor system 102 of the present invention.  FIG. 7 presents a frontal view of sensor system 102.  FIG. 7 shows a motor 702 configured to oscillate the sensor system 102 (e.g., the LIDAR 108, the
RADAR unit 222, and/or the camera 226) in and out of a plane normal to a predetermined axis (e.g., the longitudinal axis 402) of the imaging sensor (e.g., the sensor system 102).  In one embodiment of the present invention, a 12-volt DC motor operating
at a speed of 120 RPM is used to oscillate the sensor system 102 in and out the plane.  Other motors with reciprocating speeds different than 120 RPM can be used.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 7, an absolute rotary encoder 704 is placed on a shaft 706 that is oscillating.  The encoder 704 provides an accurate reading of the angle at which the shaft 706 is instantaneously located.  By the encoder 704, an accurate
measurement of the direction that the sensor system 102 is pointed, at the time of the scan, is known.  In one embodiment of the present invention, the encoder 704 is an ethernet optical encoder (commercially available from Fraba Posital), placed on
shaft 706 to provide both the angular position and angular velocity of the shaft.
<br/><br/> To decrease the delay between reading a value from the sensor and reading a value from the encoder, a separate 100 MBit ethernet connection with its own dedicated ethernet card connected the sensor processor 600 (shown in FIG. 6) with the
encoder.  This created communications delays between the encoder and the I/O computer that were consistent at approximately 0.5 ms.  Testing revealed that an actual scan (e.g., LADAR scan) was taken approximately 12.5 ms before the data was available at
the I/O computer.  When this time was added to the 0.5 ms of delay from the encoder communications, a 13 ms delay from the actual scan to the actual reading of the encoder position and velocity was present.  To counteract the angular offset this delay
created, in one embodiment of the present invention, the velocity of the encoder is multiplied times the communications delay of 0.013 seconds to calculate the angular offset due to the delay.  This angular offset (which was either negative or positive
depending on the direction of oscillation) was then added to the encoder's position, giving the actual angle at the time when the scan occurred.  This processing permits the orientation of the platform (e.g., LADAR platform) to be accurate within 0.05
degrees.
<br/><br/> Further, according to the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 7, the metal shaft 706 is attached to a detector bracket 708 which is supported by a metal casing 710 with bearing 712.  Bearing 712 is attached to metal casing 710 with a fastening
mechanism such as bolts 714 and 716.  Detector bracket 708 is attached to metal shaft 706.  Further, as shown in FIG. 7, metal shaft 718 is attached to bearing 720.  Bearing 720 is attached to metal casing 710 with a fastening mechanism such as bolts 722
and 724.  Push rod 726 is attached to detector bracket 708 with ball joint 728 on slot 730.  Push rod 726 is attached to pivot spacer 732 with ball joint 734.  Pivot spacer 732 is attached to servo arm 736 on slot 738.  Servo arm 736 is attached to metal
shaft 740.  Motor 702 is attached to servo arm 736 and is suspended from metal casing 710 by motor mounts 742.
<br/><br/> The sensor system 102 operates, in one embodiment, by oscillating a measurement sensor laterally about an axis of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, as shown in FIG. 4.  In the one embodiment, the shaft 740 of motor 702 rotates at a
constant speed, causing servo arm 736 to also spin at a constant speed.  One end of Push rod 726 moves with servo arm 736, causing detector bracket 708 to oscillate back and forth.  The degree of rotation can be adjusted by moving the mount point of ball
joint 728 along slot 730, and/or the mount point of ball joint 734 along slot 738.  Moving the mount point closer to shaft 718 increases the angle of rotation, while moving the mount point away from shaft 718 decreases the angle of rotation.
<br/><br/> While sensor 700 is oscillating, the sensor 700 is taking measurements of the surrounding environment along the vertical scanning plane, as shown in FIG. 4.  The absolute rotary encoder 704 operates as an angular position mechanism, and
transmits the absolute angle of deflection of detector bracket 708 to sensor processor 600.  At the same time, a real time positioning device, such as a global positioning system (GPS) 218 or an inertial navigation system (INS), transmits the location,
heading, altitude, and speed of the vehicle multiple times per second to sensor processor 600.  Software running on the sensor processor 600 integrates the data, and, in one embodiment, uses matrix transformations to transform the YZ measurements from
each 2D scan (as shown in FIG. 4) into a 3D view of the surrounding environment.  Due to the use of the real time positioning device, in the present invention, a terrain map can be calculated even while the vehicle is moving at speeds in excess of 45
miles per hour.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 is a path adjustment view 850 that illustrates results of path planning.  In FIG. 8, the sensor system 102 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 identifies an object 408 in an optimal route 802.  The processor 202 determines that
there is adequate clearance to permit the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to deviate to the right as it advances to the obstacle 408 and then deviate left to return to the optimal route 802.  The projected path of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle
100 is shown by different route 804.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may determine that multiple objects 408 block the optimal route 802.  The processor 202, working in concert with a sensor fusion algorithm 1338 (shown in FIG. 2), may divide the path and
a data map into sectors.  The first portion of the path may contain no obstacles and require no deviation along the optimal route 802.  The second section may contain the object 408, and a third section may contain an additional obstacle.  The object 408
in the second section of the path may require the processor 202 to determine clearance and a path around the object 408.  Further, deviation from the path may require controlling the speed of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 so as to safely pass
the object 408 at a speed suited for the radius of the turn.  If the object 408 in the third section of the path continues to block the path of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may determine if the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 should remain on the different route 804 (e.g., the path taken to avoid the object 408 located in the second section), return to the optimal route 802, or take an alternate different route (not show) to avoid the
second object 408.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9A is an envelope view 950 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 with an envelope 900 defined by a set of minimum ranges 902.  A minimum distance 911 in a direction in front 916, behind 918, to a right 914, to a left 913, above, and/or
below the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may compose the envelope 900.  In one embodiment, ultrasound signals (e.g., emitted, relayed and/or processed by an ultrasound unit 228) may be used to monitor and/or maintain the set of minimum ranges 902. 
In another embodiment, the set of minimum ranges 902 may depend on a speed 5307 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle, a set of weather conditions, the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152, the item 4502, and a nature of the object 409
that is in close proximity with the autonomous neighborhood vehicle etc. In FIG. 9A, the set of minimum ranges are defined in four directions around the vehicle and are useful to define an exemplary envelope 900 around the autonomous neighborhood vehicle
100.  Such an envelope 900 can be used to control the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 by monitoring object tracks and changing neighborhood autonomous vehicle's 100 speed and course to avoid other objects (e.g., the object 408) entering the envelope
900.  Additionally, communication with other vehicles (e.g., other autonomous neighborhood vehicle) can be utilized to coordinate between the vehicles, for example, with both vehicles changing speed and/or course to avoid either vehicle's envelopes 900
from being entered.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9B is an envelope implementation view 951 illustrating the envelope 900 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 being maintained in pedestrian traffic on the sidewalk 112.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may
use a radar signal 908 to detect a range 906A from an object (e.g., the pedestrian 904A).  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may adjust speed and/or course to ensure that the envelope 900 is not breached and avoid collisions.  The autonomous
neighborhood vehicle 100 may use ultrasonic ranging signals 910 (e.g., ultrasound) to detect a range (e.g., a range 906B) from an object (e.g., the pedestrian 904B).  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may use its sensors (e.g.,
the LIDAR 108, the RADAR unit 222, the camera 226, the sensor system 102, and/or the ultrasound unit 228) and/or sensor fusion algorithm 1338 to locate and/or calculate an optimal route through obstacles (e.g., pedestrian traffic) in order to maximize
travel efficiency (e.g., minimize travel time) while maintaining the envelope 900.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may draft off objects (e.g., bikers, pedestrians), increasing fuel economy.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may be able to communicate with a traffic server in order to gain
access to traffic patterns and/or traffic light patters.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may be able to integrate this information along with pedestrian monitoring techniques to calculate and/or plan an optimal route and/or reroute to an optimal
path (e.g., when the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 encounters traffic, delays, construction).  Additionally, by integrating pedestrian monitoring techniques with vehicle control methods and by enforcing minimum desirable ranges, the autonomous
neighborhood vehicle 100 may be able to maximize efficiency while increasing safety.  Further, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may be able to automatically park, deliver items, recharge or refuel (e.g., by automatically traveling to a fueling
area when energy levels reach a threshold level and/or perform necessary steps to charge itself), send the itself for maintenance, pick up parcels, perform any other similar tasks, and/or return at a set time or on command to a predetermined location.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9C is a caravan view 952 of three autonomous neighborhood vehicles 100 in a caravan 912 on the sidewalk 112.  In one embodiment, autonomous neighborhood vehicles 100 may be caravanned.  For example, urbanized areas can use platooned
vehicles to implement mass deliveries.  A caravan 912 can make circuitous routes in an urban area, making scheduled stops or drive-bys to load and/or unload items in the caravan 912.  Platoons (e.g., caravans 912) may be formed (e.g., set up to execute
large deliveries together) and/or formed on route (e.g., autonomous neighborhood vehicles 100 may be able to meet up to form a platoon when forming a platoon would improve the capabilities of the autonomous neighborhood vehicles 100 (e.g., allowing them
to draft off one another, to expedite deliveries and/or pick-ups, to coordinate delivery and/or pick up times)).  Autonomous neighborhood vehicles 100 may not need to have the same owner, cargo, settings (e.g., envelope settings, speed settings etc.) in
order to form the caravan 912.  Caravans 912 may allow the autonomous neighborhood vehicles 100 to travel in closer proximity to one another (e.g., with smaller sets of minimum rangers 902 of the envelopes 900) than would otherwise be permitted.
<br/><br/> Minimum ranges for the autonomous neighborhood autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 100 are desirable in controlling the autonomous neighborhood autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 100, as described in methods above in FIG. 9B.  A number of
methods to define the set of minimum ranges 902 are known.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 is a break time view 1000 that describes one exemplary method to formulate a minimum desirable range in front of the autonomous neighborhood autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, in accordance with the present disclosure.  A minimum
stopping time is described to include a time defined by a minimum time to brake, a control reaction time, and additional factors affecting time to stop.
<br/><br/> A minimum time to brake describes a braking capacity of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 at the present speed.  Such a braking capacity can be determined for a particular autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 through many methods, for
example, by testing the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 at various speeds.  It will be appreciated that braking capacity for different autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100s will be different values, for example, with a large autonomous neighborhood
vehicle 100 requiring a greater time to stop than a smaller autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  A control reaction time includes both mechanical responses in the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to an operator or control module ordering a stop and a
response time of the operator or the control module to an impetus describing a need to stop.
<br/><br/> Factors affecting a time to stop include road conditions; weather conditions; autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 maintenance conditions, including conditions of the braking devices on the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and tire tread;
operability of autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 control systems such as anti-lock braking and lateral stability control.  Factors can include a selectable or automatically calibrating factor for occupants in the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100,
for example, particular driver reaction times and comfort of the occupants of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 with close ranges between autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100s.  Time to stop values can readily be converted to minimum desirable
ranges by one having ordinary skill in the art.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the above mentioned method for determining the minimum time to break may be used to calculate a magnitude of deceleration.  If the calculated magnitude of deceleration is greater than the established maximum magnitude of
deceleration, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may determine if there is an alternative action that will not break an established constraint (e.g., the envelope 900 and/or an established maximum speed).  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle may
also prioritize constraints and choose to maintain ones that are prioritized higher than others (e.g., the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may exceed that maximum magnitude of deceleration in order to avoid a collision when no other viable actions
are available).  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may combine the above mentioned calculations of minimum time to break with the predicted behaviors 305 mentioned in FIGS. 3A-C) to decrease speed, alter the path of the autonomous neighborhood
vehicle 100, increase speed etc. For example, if the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 determines that the likelihood of occurrence of a predicted behavior that would cause the autonomous vehicle to need to decelerate at a magnitude greater than the
maximum magnitude of deceleration is above a threshold level, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may take proactive measures to avoid such a scenario (e.g., reduce the speed of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100).
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 is a GPS monitoring view 1150 depicting an exemplary GPS coordinate monitored through a GPS device combined with 3D map data for the GPS coordinate.  A nominal location 1102 identified through a GPS device can be used to describe an area
wherein the device can be located.  In FIG. 11, the nominal location 1102 combined with GPS error yields an area wherein the GPS device in the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 can be located or an area of possible autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100
locations.  The coordinate of the nominal location 1102 can be coordinated with corresponding coordinates in 3D map data, and the area of possible autonomous neighborhood vehicle locations 1104 can be projected onto a map.
<br/><br/> Within the area of possible autonomous neighborhood vehicle locations 1104 made possible by monitoring GPS data, other information can be utilized to localize the location of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 within the area of possible
autonomous neighborhood vehicle locations 1104 described in FIG. 12.  For example, image recognition methods can be utilized to identify features on the road in front of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  In one embodiment, the sensor fusion
algorithm 1338 may combine information from multiple sensors on the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to more accurately locate the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 is a location identification view 1250 depicting an identification of a lateral position as well as an angular orientation with respect to the lane.  This information can be used to place the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 within
the area of possible autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 locations.  Further, lane markers can be examined, for example, utilizing a dotted line versus a solid line to identify a lane of travel from possible lanes of travel within the possible autonomous
neighborhood vehicle 100 locations.  Additionally, any recognizable features identified within the camera data can be used to fix a location.  Recognizable features that can be identified and used in conjunction with a 3D map database to determine
location include occurrence of an intersection, an off-ramp or on-ramp, encountering a bridge or overpass, approaching an identifiable building, or any other similar details contained within the 3D map data.
<br/><br/> Methods utilized in FIG. 12 can sufficiently locate the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 or may designate a range of locations or alternate locations where the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 might be located.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a directional signal, such as a radio signal from a known source or a radar signal return, may be used to localize the position of an autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  In the exemplary determination made in FIG. 12, a
range of possible vehicle locations 1200 has been determined A directional signal from the radio tower depicted allows an intersection between the range of positions within the lane determined in FIG. 12 and the direction to the radio tower (not shown)
to determine a fixed location of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  In this way, a combination of information sources can be utilized to determine a fixed location of an autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 with reasonable accuracy.
<br/><br/> In an alternate embodiment, a location of an autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may be fixed, refining an approximate location originating from a GPS coordinate and a digital map database, first with visual data or radar data and then with a
radio or other wireless directional signal.  It will be appreciated that a number of methods to localize the position of an autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 can be utilized equally to fix the location of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to
enable the methods described herein.  For example, in combination with a GPS signal, visual data, or radar data in combination with digital map information, a plurality of radio, radar, or similar signals originating from known sources can be utilized to
localize a position of an autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  In another example, a local communications network could contain a local correction factor specific to that geographic location to correct position determined by GPS coordinates.  The
disclosure is not intended to be limited to the particular examples described herein.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, radar returns or radio returns from two known objects can be used to triangulate position of an autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 on a map.  Once a position is fixed at some instant in time, another method could determine an
estimated change in position of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 by estimating motion of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, for example, assuming travel along the present sidewalk 112 based upon a monitored speed, through use of a gyroscopic
or accelerometer device, or based upon determining a GPS error margin by comparing the last fixed location to the GPS nominal position at that instant and assuming the GPS error margin to be similar for some period.  One having ordinary skill in the art
will appreciate that many such exemplary methods are known, and the disclosure is not intended to be limited to the exemplary methods described herein.
<br/><br/> Further, an exemplary infrastructure device includes a GPS differential device, for example, that can be located along roads, communicate with passing vehicles, and provide a GPS offset value to the autonomous neighborhood vehicles 100 for a
localized area.  In such a known device, a GPS nominal location for the device is compared to a fixed, known position for the device, and the difference yields a GPS offset value that can be utilized by vehicles (e.g., the autonomous neighborhood vehicle
100) operating in the area.  Through use of such a device, sensor readings and calculations to triangulate a location of a host vehicle are unnecessary.  Using methods to determine a location of a leader vehicle in a caravan 912 (e.g., convoy) and
coordinate a number of vehicles based upon the operation of the leader vehicle can be of great advantage to streamlining travel within a densely populated or urban area.
<br/><br/> Object tracking is a method whereby a host vehicle utilizes information such as radar returns to determine sequential relative positions of a target object to the host vehicle.  In one embodiment, positions for a first object (e.g., the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100), O.sub.1, and a second object, O.sub.2, are described at sequential times T.sub.1-T.sub.3.  The three plotted positions of object O.sub.1 describe an object getting sequentially closer to the host vehicle.  Such a
track can be utilized in a number of ways by the host vehicle (e.g., the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100), for example, by comparing a range to O.sub.1 to a minimum allowable range or by determining a likelihood of collision between O.sub.1 and the
host vehicle (e.g., the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100).
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 further depicts exemplary analysis of a vehicle's lateral position and angle of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle with respect to the lane 1202 (theta) based upon sensor information, in accordance with the present disclosure.  The
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 is depicted including in the sidewalk 112.  A visual field can be described by an area that is represented in a visual image.  Boundaries of a visual field that can be analyzed through a visual image can be described
as an angular area extending outward from the camera capturing the image.  By utilizing image recognition methods, lane markers, road features, landmarks, other vehicles on the road, or other recognizable images can be utilized to estimate a vehicle
position and orientation with respect to sidewalk 112.  From analysis of visual images, a lateral position within lane (e.g., the sidewalk 112), defined by terms A and B defining lateral positioning in the lane, can be estimated, for example, according
to distances a and b from the lane markers.
<br/><br/> Similarly, orientation of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 within the lane can be estimated and described as angle theta.  In one embodiment, the angle of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle with respect to the lane 1202 may refer to an
angle of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle with respect to the path (e.g., the planned path, the optimal path).  This may allow the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to autonomously travel and/or navigate without a need for lane markers, designated
lines, and/or paths.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 13A and 13B are exemplary range scans 1350 and 1351 for the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  FIG. 13A depicts a first range scan 1300 along the road (not shown), in which the segments a-b.sub.1 and c.sub.1-d represent a sidewalk on
either side of the road, segments b.sub.1-b.sub.2 and c.sub.1-c.sub.2 represent a curb adjacent to each sidewalk, and the middle segment b.sub.2-c.sub.2 represents the road.  FIG. 13B depicts a second range scan 1302 further along the road, in which the
segment e-f, in between the segment b-c, represents an obstacle such as a car on the road in front of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  In FIGS. 13A and 13B, the beam lines R.sub.0, R.sub.i and R.sub.m, extending from an origin O for each of
range scans 1300 and 1302, represent the distances (ranges) from the laser scanner to the points a, i, and d. The angle .alpha..sub.i is the azimuth angle of the line O-i with respect to the laser scanner reference.
<br/><br/> Due to noise in the range measurements, as well as the configuration and condition of roads and sidewalks, classification of traversable and non-traversable areas based on only one range scan is not reliable and robust.  Accordingly, the method
of the invention builds a three-dimensional road model from cumulated range scans, which are gathered by the laser scanner, and from geo-locations, which are obtained from the navigation unit.  This three-dimensional road model, which represents a ground
plane, is formulated as a constrained quadratic surface.  The inputted range scan data, after being transformed into world coordinate points of the three-dimensional road model, can then be correctly classified based on heights above the ground plane.

join the system by clicking directly on an HTML link included in the e-mail message (e.g., http://www.fatdoor.com/join.jsp?Invite=140807).  In one embodiment, the user (e.g., the user 2916 of FIG. 29) may import e-mail addresses from a standard
computerized address book.  The system may further notify the inviting user when her invitee accepts or declines the invitation to join the neighborhood (e.g., the neighborhood 2902A-N of FIG. 29).
<br/><br/> FIG. 23 is a flowchart of inviting the invitee(s) by the registered user, notifying the registered user upon the acceptance of the invitation by the invitee(s) and, processing and storing the input data associated with the user (e.g., the user
2916 of FIG. 29) in the database, according to one embodiment.  In operation 2302, the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) willing to invite the individual enters
the email addresses of an individual "invitee".  In operation 2304, the email address and the related data of the invitee may be stored in the database.  In operation 2306, the invitation content for inviting the invitee may be generated from the data
stored in the database.  In operation 2308, the registered user sends invitation to the invitee(s).
<br/><br/> In operation 2310, response from the user (e.g., the user 2916 of FIG. 29) may be determined.  The operation 2312, if the invitee doesn't respond to invitation sent by the registered user then registered user may resend the invitation for a
predefined number of times.  In operation 2314, if the registered user resends the invitation to the same invitee for predefined number of times and if the invitee still doesn't respond to the invitation the process may be terminated automatically.
<br/><br/> In operation 2316, if the invitee accepts the invitation sent by the registered user then system may notify the registered user that the invitee has accepted the invitation.  In operation 2318, the input from the present invitee(s) that may
contain the descriptive data about the friend (e.g., registered user) may be processed and stored in the database.
<br/><br/> For example, each registered user associated e-mail addresses of individuals who are not registered users may be stored and identified by each registered user as neighbors.  An invitation to become a new user (e.g., the user 2916 of FIG. 29) may
be communicated out to neighbor (e.g., the neighbors neighbor of FIG. 29) of the particular user.  An acceptance of the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) to whom the invitation was sent may be processed.
<br/><br/> The neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) may be added to a database and/or storing of the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29), a user ID and a set of user IDs of registered users who are directly connected to the neighbor
(e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29), the set of user IDs stored of the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) including at least the user ID of the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified
registered user 4110 of FIG. 16).  Furthermore, the verified registered user may be notified that the invitation to the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) has been accepted when an acceptance is processed.  Also, inputs from the neighbor
(e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) having descriptive data about the friend may be processed and the inputs in the database may be stored.
<br/><br/> FIG. 24 is a flowchart of adding the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) to the queue, according to one embodiment.  In operation 2402, the system may start with the empty connection list and empty queue.  In operation 2404, the user
may be added to the queue.  In operation 2406, it is determined whether the queue is empty.  In operation 2408, if it is determined that the queue is not empty then the next person P may be taken from the queue.  In operation 2410, it may be determined
whether the person P from the queue is user B or not.  In operation 2412, if the person P is not user B then it may be determined whether the depth of the geographical location is less than maximum degrees of separation.
<br/><br/> If it is determined that depth is more than maximum allowable degrees of separation then it may repeat the operation 2408.  In operation 2414, if may be determined that the depth of the geographical location (e.g., the geographical location 4004
of FIG. 40A) is less than maximum degrees of separation then the neighbors (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) list for person P may be processed.  In operation 2416, it may be determined whether all the neighbors (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) in
the neighborhood (e.g., the neighborhood 2902A-N of FIG. 29) have been processed or not.  If all the friends are processed it may be determined the queue is empty.
<br/><br/> In operation 2418, if all the neighbors (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) for person P are not processed then next neighbor N may be taken from the list.  In operation 2420, it may be determined whether the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920
of FIG. 29) N has encountered before or not.  In operation 2422, if the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) has not been encountered before then the neighbor may be added to the queue.  In operation 2424, if the neighbor N has been encountered
before it may be further determined whether the geographical location (e.g., the geographical location 4004 of FIG. 40A) from where the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) has encountered previously is the same place or closer to that place.
<br/><br/> If it is determined that the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) has encountered at the same or closer place then the friend may be added to the queue.  If it may be determined that friend is not encountered at the same place or closer
to that place then it may be again checked that all the friends have processed.  In operation 2426, if it is determined that the person P is user B than the connection may be added to the connection list and after adding the connection to connection list
it follows the operation 2412.  In operation 2428, if it may be determined that queue is empty then the operation may return the connections list.
<br/><br/> For example, a first user ID with the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) and a second user ID may be applied to the different registered user.  The
verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) with the different registered user may be connected with each other through at least one of a geo-positioning data associated
with the first user ID and the second user ID.  In addition, a maximum degree of separation (Nmax) of at least two that is allowed for connecting any two registered users, (e.g., the two registered users who may be directly connected may be deemed to be
separated by one degree of separation and two registered users who may be connected through no less than one other registered user may be deemed to be separated by two degrees of separation and two registered users who may be connected through not less
than N other registered users may be deemed to be separated by N+1 degrees of separation).
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the user ID of the different registered user may be searched (e.g., the method limits the searching of the different registered user in the sets of user IDs that may be stored as registered users who are less than Nmax degrees of
separation away from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16), such that the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the
verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) and the different registered user who may be separated by more than Nmax degrees of separation are not found and connected) in a set of user IDs that may be stored of registered users who are less than Nmax
degrees of separation away from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16), and not in the sets of user IDs that may be stored for registered users who are greater
than or equal to Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16), until the user ID of the different registered user may be found in
one of the searched sets.  Also, the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) may be connected to the different registered user if the user ID of the different
registered user may be found in one of the searched sets.
<br/><br/> Moreover, the sets of user IDs that may be stored of registered users may be searched initially who are directly connected to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110
of FIG. 16).  A profile of the different registered user may be communicated to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) to display through a marker associating the
verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) with the different registered user.  A connection path between the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user
4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) and the different registered user, the connection path indicating at least one other registered user may be stored through whom the connection path between the verified registered user
(e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) and the different registered user is made.
<br/><br/> In addition, the connection path between the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) and the different registered user may be communicated to the verified
registered user to display.  A hyperlink in the connection path of each of the at least one registered users may be embedded through whom the connection path between the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the
verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) and the different registered user is made.
<br/><br/> FIG. 25 is a flowchart of communicating brief profiles of the registered users, processing a hyperlink selection from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG.
16) and calculating and ensuring the Nmax degree of separation of the registered users away from verified registered users (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16), according to one embodiment. In operation 2502, the data of the registered users may be collected from the database.  In operation 2504, the relational path between the first user and the second user may be calculated (e.g., the Nmax degree of separation between verified registered
user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) and the registered user).
<br/><br/> For example, the brief profiles of registered users, including a brief profile of the different registered user, to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG.
16) for display, each of the brief profiles including a hyperlink to a corresponding full profile may be communicated.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the hyperlink selection from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) may be processed (e.g., upon processing the hyperlink selection of the
full profile of the different registered user, the full profile of the different registered user may be communicated to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) for
display).  In addition, the brief profiles of those registered users may be ensured who are more than Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user
4110 of FIG. 16) are not communicated to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) for display.
<br/><br/> FIG. 26 is an N degree separation view 2650, according to one embodiment.  ME may be a verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) of the global neighborhood
environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29) centered in the neighborhood network.  A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, and/or U may be the other registered user of the neighborhood network.  The member of the
neighborhood network may be separated from the centered verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) ME of the neighborhood network by certain degree of separation.  The
registered user A, B and C may be directly connected and are deemed to be separated by one degree of separation from verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) ME.  The
registered user D, E, F, G, and H may be connected through no less than one other registered user may be deemed to be separated by two degree of separation from verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified
registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) ME.  The registered user I, J, K, and L may be connected through no less than N-1 other registered user may be deemed to be separated by N degree of separation from verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered
user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) ME.  The registered user M, N, O, P, Q, R S, T and U may be all registered user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 27 is a user interface view 2700 showing a map, according to one embodiment.  Particularly FIG. 27 illustrates a satellite photo of a physical world.  The registered user of the global neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server
2900 of FIG. 29) may use this for exploring the geographical location (e.g., the geographical location 4004 of FIG. 40A) of the neighbors (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29).  The registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B,
the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) may navigate, zoom, explore and quickly find particular desired geographical locations of the desired neighbors (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29).  This may help the registered user to read the map and/or
plot the route of the neighbors (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) on the world map.
<br/><br/> FIG. 28A is a process flow of searching map based community and neighborhood contribution, according to one embodiment.  In operation 2802, a verified registered user (e.g., a verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-13B, a verified registered
user 4110 of FIG. 16) may be associated with a user profile (e.g., a user profile 29200 of FIG. 40A).  In operation 2804, the user profile (e.g., the user profile 29200 of FIG. 40A) may be associated with a specific geographic location (e.g., a
geographic location 4004 of FIG. 40A).
<br/><br/> In operation 2806, a map (e.g., a map 4002 of FIG. 40A-12B, a map 1400 of FIG. 14, a map 1600 of FIG. 16, a map 1701 of FIG. 17) may be generated concurrently displaying the user profile (e.g., the user profile 29200 of FIG. 40A) and the
specific geographic location (e.g., the geographic location 4004 of FIG. 40A).  In operation, 2808, in the map, claimable profiles (e.g., a claimable profile 4006 of FIG. 40A-B, a claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, a claimable profile 1704 of FIG. 17)
associated with different geographic locations may be simultaneously generated surrounding the specific geographic location (e.g., the geographic location 4004 of FIG. 40A) associated with the user profile (e.g., the user profile 29200 of FIG. 40A).
<br/><br/> In operation 2810, a query of at least one of the user profile (e.g., the user profile 29200 of FIG. 40A) and the specific geographic location (e.g., the geographic location 4004 of FIG. 40A) may be processed.  In operation 2812, a particular
claimable profile of the claimable profiles (e.g., the claimable profile 4006 of FIG. 40A-B, the claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, the claimable profile 1704 of FIG. 17) may be converted to another user profile (e.g., the user profile 29200 of FIG.
40A) when a different registered user claims a particular geographic location to the specific geographic location (e.g., the geographic location 4004 of FIG. 40A) associated with the particular claimable profile (e.g., the claimable profile 4006 of FIG.
40A-B, the claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, the claimable profile 1704 of FIG. 17), wherein the user profile (e.g., the user profile 29200 of FIG. 40A) may be tied to a specific property in a neighborhood (e.g., a neighborhood 2902A-2902N of FIG. 29),
and wherein the particular claimable profile (e.g., the claimable profile 4006 of FIG. 40A-12B, the claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, the claimable profile 1704 of FIG. 17) may be associated with a neighboring property to the specific property in the
neighborhood (e.g., the neighborhood 2920A-2920N of FIG. 29).
<br/><br/> In operation 2814, a certain claimable profile (e.g., the claimable profile 4006 of FIG. 40A-12B, the claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, the claimable profile 1704 of FIG. 17) of the claimable profiles (e.g., the claimable profile 4006 of FIG.
40A-B, the claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, the claimable profile 1704 of FIG. 17) may be delisted when a private registered user claims a certain geographic location (e.g., the geographic location 4004 of FIG. 40A) adjacent to at least one of the
specific geographic location and the particular geographic location (e.g., the geographic location 4004 of FIG. 40A).
<br/><br/> In operation 2816, the certain claimable profile (e.g., the claimable profile 4006 of FIG. 40A-B, the claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, the claimable profile 1704 of FIG. 17) in the map (e.g., the map 4002 of FIG. 40A-B, the map 1400 of FIG.
14, the map 1600 of FIG. 16, the map 1701 of FIG. 17) when the certain claimable profile may be delisted and/or be masked through the request of the private registered user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 28B is a continuation of process flow of FIG. 28A showing additional processes, according to one embodiment.  In operation 2818, a tag data associated with at least one of the specific geographic location, the particular geographic location
(e.g., the geographic location 4004 of FIG. 40A), and the delisted geographic location may be processed.  In operation 2820, a frequent one of the tag data may be displayed when at least one of the specific geographic location and the particular
geographic location (e.g., the geographic location 4004 of FIG. 40A) may be made active, but not when the geographic location (e.g., the geographic location 4004 of FIG. 40A) may be delisted.
<br/><br/> In operation 2822, a commercial user (e.g., a commercial user 4100 of FIG. 41A-B) may be permitted to purchase a customizable business profile (e.g., a customizable business profile 4104 of FIG. 41B) associated with a commercial geographic
location.  In operation 2824, the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) to communicate a message to the neighborhood (e.g., the neighborhood 2902A-2902N of FIG. 29)
may be enabled based on a selectable distance range away from the specific geographic location.
<br/><br/> In operation 2826, a payment of the commercial user (e.g., the commercial user 4100 of FIG. 41A-B) and the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) may be
processed.  In operation 2828, the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) may be permitted to edit any information in the claimable profiles (e.g., the claimable
profile 4006 of FIG. 40A-B, the claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, the claimable profile 1704 of FIG. 17) including the particular claimable profile and the certain claimable profile until the certain claimable profile may be claimed by at least one of
the different registered user and the private registered user.
<br/><br/> In operation 2830, a claimant of any claimable profile (e.g., the claimable profile 4006 of FIG. 40A-B, the claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, the claimable profile 1704 of FIG. 17) may be enabled to control what information is displayed on
their user profile (e.g., the user profile 29200 of FIG. 40A).  In operation 2832, the claimant to segregate certain information on their user profile (e.g., the user profile 29200 of FIG. 40A) may be allowed such that only other registered users
directly connected to the claimant are able to view data on their user profile (e.g., the user profile 29200 of FIG. 40A).
<br/><br/> FIG. 28C is a continuation of process flow of FIG. 28B showing additional processes, according to one embodiment.  In operation 2834, a first user ID with the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the
verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) and a second user ID to the different registered user may be applied.  In operation 2836, the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of
FIG. 16) with the different registered user with each other may be connected through at least one of associated with the first user ID and the second user ID.
<br/><br/> In operation 2838, a maximum degree of separation (Nmax) of at least two may be set that is allowed for connecting any two registered users, wherein two registered users who are directly connected may be deemed to be separated by one degree of
separation and two registered users who are connected through no less than one other registered user may be deemed to be separated by two degrees of separation and two registered users who may be connected through no less than N other registered users
are deemed to be separated by N+1 degrees of separation.  In operation 2840, the user ID of the different registered user may be searched in a set of user IDs that are stored of registered users who are less than Nmax degrees of separation away from the
verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16), and not in the sets of user IDs that are stored for registered users who may be greater than or equal to Nmax degrees of
separation away from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16), until the user ID of the different registered user may be found in one of the searched sets.
<br/><br/> In operation 2842, the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) may be connected to the different registered user if the user ID of the different registered
user may be found in one of the searched sets, wherein the method limits the searching of the different registered user in the sets of user IDs that may be stored of registered users who may be less than Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified
registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16), such that the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of
FIG. 16) and the different registered user who may be separated by more than Nmax degrees of separation are not found and connected.  In operation 2844, initially in the sets of user IDs that are stored of registered users who may be directly connected
to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) may be initially searched.
<br/><br/> FIG. 28D is a continuation of process flow of FIG. 28C showing additional processes, according to one embodiment.  In operation 2846, a profile of the different registered user to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user
4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) to display may be communicated through a marker associating the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG.
16) with the different registered user.
<br/><br/> In operation 2848, a connection path between the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) and the different registered user, the connection path indicating at
least one other registered user may be stored through whom the connection path between the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) and the different registered user
may be made.
<br/><br/> In operation 2850, the connection path between the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) and the different registered user to the verified registered user
(e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) may be communicated to display.
<br/><br/> In operation 2852, a hyperlink in the connection path of each of the at least one registered users may be embedded through whom the connection path between the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the
verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) and the different registered user may be made.  In operation 2854, each registered user associated e-mail addresses of individuals who are not registered users may be stored and identified by each registered user
as neighbors (e.g., a neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29).
<br/><br/> In operation 2856, an invitation may be communicated to become a new user (e.g., a user 2916 of FIG. 29) to neighbors (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) of the particular user.  In operation 2858, an acceptance of the neighbor (e.g., the
neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) to whom the invitation was sent may be processed.  In operation 2860, the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) to a database and storing of the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29), a user ID and the set of
user IDs of registered users may be added who are directly connected to the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29), the set of user IDs stored of the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) including at least the user ID of the verified
registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16).
<br/><br/> FIG. 28E is a continuation of process flow of FIG. 28D showing additional processes, according to one embodiment.  In operation 2862, the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered
user 4110 of FIG. 16) that the invitation to the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) has been accepted may be notified when the acceptance is processed.
<br/><br/> In operation 2864, inputs from the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) having descriptive data about the friend and storing the inputs in the database may be processed.  In operation 2866, brief profiles of registered users, including
a brief profile of the different registered user may be communicated, to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) for display, each of the brief profiles including
the hyperlink to a corresponding full profile.
<br/><br/> In operation 2868, the hyperlink selection from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) may be processed, wherein, upon processing the hyperlink selection
of the full profile of the different registered user, the full profile of the different registered user is communicated to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16)
for display.
<br/><br/> In operation 2870, brief profiles of those registered users who may be more than Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG.
16) may not communicated to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, the verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) may be ensured for display.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 is described.  This embodiment includes a privacy server 2900 to apply an address verification algorithm (e.g., using verify module 3006 of FIG. 30) associated with each user of
the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) to verify that each user lives at a residence associated with a claimable residential address 4247
(e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) of an online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) formed through a
social community module 2906 of the privacy server 2900 using a processor 3902 and a memory (e.g., as described in FIG. 39).
<br/><br/> A network 2904, and a mapping server 2926 (e.g., providing global map data) communicatively coupled with the privacy server 2900 through the network 2904 generate a latitudinal data and a longitudinal data associated with each claimable
residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in
FIG. 38) associated with each user of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) in this embodiment.
<br/><br/> The privacy server 2900 automatically determines a set of access privileges in the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 31 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) associated
with each user of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) by constraining access in the online community (e.g., as shown in the social
community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) based on a neighborhood boundary determined using a Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of the privacy server 2900 in this embodiment.
<br/><br/> The privacy server 2900 (e.g., a hardware device of a global neighborhood environment 1800) may transform the claimable residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) into a claimed
address upon an occurrence of an event.  The privacy server 2900 may instantiate the event when a particular user 2916 is associated with the claimable residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG.
31) based on a verification of the particular user 2916 as living at a particular residential address (e.g., associated with the residence 2918 of FIG. 29) associated with the claimable residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable
module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) using the privacy server 2900.  The privacy server 2900 may constrain the particular user 2916 to communicate through the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through
the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) only with a set of neighbors 2928 (e.g., such as the particular neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29 forming an occupant data) having verified addresses using the privacy server 2900.  The privacy server 2900
may define the set of neighbors 2928 (e.g., such as the particular neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) as other users of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described
in FIG. 38) that have each verified their addresses in the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) using the privacy server 2900 and/or which
have each claimed residential addresses that are in a threshold radial distance 4219 from the claimed address of the particular user 2916.
<br/><br/> The privacy server 2900 may constrain the threshold radial distance 4219 to be less than a distance of the neighborhood boundary using the Bezier curve algorithm 3040.  The privacy server 2900 may permit the neighborhood boundary to take on a
variety of shapes based on an associated geographic connotation, a historical connotation, a political connotation, and/or a cultural connotation of neighborhood boundaries.  The privacy server 2900 may apply a database of constraints (e.g., the
databases of FIG. 30 including the places database 3018) associated with neighborhood boundaries that are imposed on a map view of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network
module as described in FIG. 38) when permitting the neighborhood boundary to take on the variety of shapes.
<br/><br/> The privacy server 2900 may generate a user-generated boundary in a form of a polygon describing geo spatial boundaries defining the particular neighborhood when a first user of a particular neighborhood that verifies a first residential address
of the particular neighborhood using the privacy server 2900 prior to other users in that particular neighborhood verifying their addresses in that particular neighborhood places a set of points defining the particular neighborhood using a set of drawing
tools in the map view of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38).  The privacy server 2900 may optionally extend the threshold radial
distance 4219 to an adjacent boundary of an adjacent neighborhood based a request of the particular user 2916.  The privacy server 2900 may generate a separate login to the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36
formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) designed to be usable by a police department, a municipal agency, a neighborhood association, and/or a neighborhood leader associated with the particular neighborhood.
<br/><br/> The separate login may permit the police department, the municipal agency, the neighborhood association, and/or the neighborhood leader to: (1) invite residents of the particular neighborhood themselves (e.g., see the user interface view of FIG.
22) using the privacy server 2900 using a self-authenticating access code that permits new users that enter the self-authenticating access code in the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the
neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) to automatically join the particular neighborhood as verified users (e.g., the verified user 4110 of FIG. 41A), (2) generate a virtual neighborhood watch group and/or an emergency preparedness group
restricted to users verified in the particular neighborhood using the privacy server 2900, (3) conduct high value crime and/or safety related discussions from local police and/or fire officials that is restricted to users verified in the particular
neighborhood using the privacy server 2900, (4) broadcast information across the particular neighborhood, and (5) receive and/or track neighborhood level membership and/or activity to identify leaders from the restricted group of users verified in the
particular neighborhood using the privacy server 2900.
<br/><br/> The privacy server 2900 may permit each of the restricted group of users verified in the particular neighborhood using the privacy server 2900 to: (1) share information about a suspicious activity that is likely to affect several neighborhoods,
(2) explain about a lost pet that might have wandered into an adjoining neighborhood, (3) rally support from neighbors 2928 (e.g., such as the particular neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) from multiple neighborhoods to address civic issues, (4) spread
information about events comprising a local theater production and/or a neighborhood garage sale, and/or (5) solicit advice and/or recommendations from the restricted group of users verified in the particular neighborhood and/or optionally in the
adjacent neighborhood.
<br/><br/> The privacy server 2900 may flag a neighborhood feed from the particular neighborhood and/or optionally from the adjacent neighborhood as being inappropriate.  The privacy server 2900 may suspend users that repeatedly communicate
self-promotional messages that are inappropriate as voted based on a sensibility of any one of the verified users (e.g., the verified user 4110 of FIG. 41A) of the particular neighborhood and/or optionally from the adjacent neighborhood.  The privacy
server 2900 may personalize which nearby neighborhoods that verified users (e.g., the verified user 4110 of FIG. 41A) are able to communicate through based on a request of the particular user 2916.  The privacy server 2900 may permit the neighborhood
leader to communicate privately with leaders of an adjoining neighborhood to plan and/or organize on behalf of an entire constituency of verified users (e.g., a plurality of the verified user 4110 of FIG. 41A) of the particular neighborhood associated
with the neighborhood leader.
<br/><br/> The privacy server 2900 may filter feeds to only display messages from the particular neighborhood associated with each verified user.  The privacy server 2900 may restrict posts only in the particular neighborhood to verified users (e.g., the
verified user 4110 of FIG. 41A) having verified addresses within the neighborhood boundary (e.g., the claim view 1550 of FIG. 15 describes a claiming process of an address).  The address verification algorithm (e.g., using verify module 3006 of FIG. 30)
of the privacy server 2900 utilizes a set of verification methods to perform verification of the particular user 2916 through any of a: (1) a postcard verification method through which the privacy server 2900 generates a physical postcard that is postal
mailed to addresses of requesting users in the particular neighborhood and/or having a unique alphanumeric sequence in a form of an access code printed thereon which authenticates users that enter the access code to view and/or search privileges in the
particular neighborhood of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38), (2) a credit card verification method through which the privacy server
2900 verifies the claimable residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) when at least one a credit card billing address and/or a debit card billing address is matched with an inputted address
through an authentication services provider, (3) a privately-published access code method through which the privacy server 2900 communicates to user profiles of the police department, the municipal agency, the neighborhood association, and/or the
neighborhood leader an instant access code that is printable at town hall meetings and/or gatherings sponsored by any one of the police department, the municipal agency, the neighborhood association, and/or the neighborhood leader, (4) a neighbor
vouching method through which the privacy server 2900 authenticates new users when existing verified users (e.g., the verified user 4110 of FIG. 41A) agree to a candidacy of new users in the particular neighborhood, (5) a phone verification method
through which the privacy server 2900 authenticates new users whose phone number is matched with an inputted phone number through the authentication services provider, and (6) a social security verification method through which the privacy server 2900
authenticates new users whose social security number is matched with an inputted social security number through the authentication services provider.
<br/><br/> The privacy server 2900 may initially set the particular neighborhood to a pilot phase status in which the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described
in FIG. 38) of the particular neighborhood is provisionally defined until a minimum number of users verify their residential addresses in the particular neighborhood through the privacy server 2900.  The privacy server 2900 may automatically delete
profiles of users that remain unverified after a threshold window of time.  The neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 may be designed to create private websites to facilitate communication among neighbors 2928 (e.g., such as the particular neighbor
2920 of FIG. 29) and/or build stronger neighborhoods.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment a method of a neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 is described.  The method includes applying an address verification algorithm (e.g., using verify module 3006 of FIG. 30) associated with each user of the online
community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) using a privacy server 2900, verifying that each user lives at a residence associated with a claimable
residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) of an online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in
FIG. 38) formed through a social community module 2906 of the privacy server 2900 using a processor 3902 and a memory (e.g., as described in FIG. 39), generating a latitudinal data and a longitudinal data associated with each claimable residential
address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38)
associated with each user of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38), and determining a set of access privileges in the online community
(e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) associated with each user of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed
through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) by constraining access in the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) based on
a neighborhood boundary determined using a Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of the privacy server 2900.
<br/><br/> The method may transform the claimable residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) into a claimed address upon an occurrence of an event.  The method may instantiate the event when a
particular user 2916 is associated with the claimable residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) based on a verification of the particular user 2916 as living at a particular residential
address (e.g., associated with the residence 2918 of FIG. 29) associated with the claimable residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) using the privacy server 2900.
<br/><br/> The method may constrain the particular user 2916 to communicate through the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) only with a set of
neighbors 2928 (e.g., such as the particular neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) having verified addresses using the privacy server 2900.  The method may define the set of neighbors 2928 (e.g., such as the particular neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) as other users of the
online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) that have each verified their addresses in the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community
view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) using the privacy server 2900 and/or which have each claimed residential addresses that are in a threshold radial distance 4219 from the claimed address of the
particular user 2916.
<br/><br/> The method may constrain the threshold radial distance 4219 to be less than a distance of the neighborhood boundary using the Bezier curve algorithm 3040.
<br/><br/> In addition, the method may define a neighborhood boundary to take on a variety of shapes based on an associated geographic connotation, a historical connotation, a political connotation, and/or a cultural connotation of neighborhood boundaries. The method may apply a database of constraints (e.g., the databases of FIG. 30 including the places database 3018) associated with neighborhood boundaries that are imposed on a map view of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view
3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) when permitting the neighborhood boundary to take on the variety of shapes.
<br/><br/> The method may generate a user-generated boundary in a form of a polygon describing geospatial boundaries defining the particular neighborhood when a first user of a particular neighborhood that verifies a first residential address of the
particular neighborhood using the privacy server 2900 prior to other users in that particular neighborhood verifying their addresses in that particular neighborhood places a set of points defining the particular neighborhood using a set of drawing tools
in the map view of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38).  The method may optionally extend the threshold radial distance 4219 to an
adjacent boundary of an adjacent neighborhood based a request of the particular user 2916.
<br/><br/> The method may generate a separate login to the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) designed to be usable by a police department, a
municipal agency, a neighborhood association, and/or a neighborhood leader associated with the particular neighborhood.
<br/><br/> The method may permit the police department, the municipal agency, the neighborhood association, and/or the neighborhood leader to: (1) invite residents of the particular neighborhood themselves (e.g., see the user interface view of FIG. 22)
using the privacy server 2900 using a self-authenticating access code that permits new users that enter the self-authenticating access code in the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the

restricted to users verified in the particular neighborhood using the privacy server 2900, (3) conduct high value crime and/or safety related discussions from local police and/or fire officials that is restricted to users verified in the particular
neighborhood using the privacy server 2900, (4) broadcast information across the particular neighborhood, and/or (5) receive and/or track neighborhood level membership and/or activity to identify leaders from the restricted group of users verified in the
particular neighborhood using the privacy server 2900.
<br/><br/> The method may permit each of the restricted group of users verified in the particular neighborhood using the privacy server 2900 to: (1) share information about a suspicious activity that is likely to affect several neighborhoods, (2) explain
about a lost pet that might have wandered into an adjoining neighborhood, (3) rally support from neighbors 2928 (e.g., such as the particular neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) from multiple neighborhoods to address civic issues, (4) spread information about

<br/><br/> The method may flag a neighborhood feed from the particular neighborhood and/or optionally from the adjacent neighborhood as being inappropriate.  The method may suspend users that repeatedly communicate self-promotional messages that are
inappropriate as voted based on a sensibility of any one of the verified users (e.g., the verified user 4110 of FIG. 41A) of the particular neighborhood and/or optionally from the adjacent neighborhood.  The method may personalize which nearby

<br/><br/> The method may filter feeds to only display messages from the particular neighborhood associated with each verified user.  The method may restrict posts only in the particular neighborhood to verified users (e.g., the verified user 4110 of FIG.
41A) having verified addresses within the neighborhood boundary (e.g., the claim view 1550 of FIG. 15 describes a claiming process of an address).  The method may utilize a set of verification methods to perform verification of the particular user 2916

verifying the claimable residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) when at least one a credit card billing address and/or a debit card billing address is matched with an inputted address
through an authentication services provider.  (3) communicating to user profiles of the police department, the municipal agency, the neighborhood association, and/or the neighborhood leader an instant access code that is printable at town hall meetings
and/or gatherings sponsored by any one of the police department, the municipal agency, the neighborhood association, and/or the neighborhood leader.  (4) authenticating new users when existing verified users (e.g., the verified user 4110 of FIG. 41A)
agree to a candidacy of new users in the particular neighborhood.  (5) authenticating new users whose phone number is matched with an inputted phone number through the authentication services provider.  (6) authenticating new users whose social security
number is matched with an inputted social security number through the authentication services provider.
<br/><br/> The method may initially set the particular neighborhood to a pilot phase status in which the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38)
of the particular neighborhood is provisionally defined until a minimum number of users verify their residential addresses in the particular neighborhood through the privacy server 2900.  The method may automatically delete profiles of users that remain
unverified after a threshold window of time.  The neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 may be designed to create private websites to facilitate communication among neighbors 2928 (e.g., such as the particular neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) and/or build
stronger neighborhoods.
<br/><br/> In yet another embodiment, another neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 is described.  This embodiment includes a privacy server 2900 to apply an address verification algorithm (e.g., using verify module 3006 of FIG. 30) associated with
each user of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) to verify that each user lives at a residence associated with a claimable residential
address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) of an online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) formed
through a social community module 2906 of the privacy server 2900 using a processor 3902 and a memory (e.g., as described in FIG. 39), a network 2904, and a mapping server 2926 (e.g., providing global map data) communicatively coupled with the privacy
server 2900 through the network 2904 to generate a latitudinal data and a longitudinal data associated with each claimable residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) of the online community
(e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) associated with each user of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed
through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38).  The privacy server 2900 automatically determines a set of access privileges in the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the
neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) associated with each user of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) by constraining
access in the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) based on a neighborhood boundary determined using a Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of the
privacy server 2900 in this embodiment.
<br/><br/> In addition, in this yet another embodiment the privacy server 2900 transforms the claimable residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) into a claimed address upon an occurrence of an
event.  The privacy server 2900 instantiates the event when a particular user 2916 is associated with the claimable residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31) based on a verification of the
particular user 2916 as living at a particular residential address (e.g., associated with the residence 2918 of FIG. 29) associated with the claimable residential address 4247 (e.g., using sub-modules of the claimable module 2910 as described in FIG. 31)
using the privacy server 2900 in this yet another embodiment.  The privacy server 2900 constrains the particular user 2916 to communicate through the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the
neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) only with a set of neighbors 2928 (e.g., such as the particular neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) having verified addresses using the privacy server 2900 in this yet another embodiment.  The privacy server
2900 defines the set of neighbors 2928 (e.g., such as the particular neighbor 2920 of FIG. 29) as other users of the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described
in FIG. 38) that have each verified their addresses in the online community (e.g., as shown in the social community view 3650 of FIG. 36 formed through the neighborhood network module as described in FIG. 38) using the privacy server 2900 and which have
each claimed residential addresses that are in a threshold radial distance 4219 from the claimed address of the particular user 2916 in this yet another embodiment.
<br/><br/> FIG. 29 is a system view of a privacy server 2900 communicating with neighborhood(s) 2902A-N through a network 2904, an advertiser(s) 2924, a mapping server 2926, an a database of neighbors 2928 (e.g., occupant data), according to one
embodiment.  Particularly FIG. 29 illustrates the privacy server 2900, the neighborhood 2902A-N, the network 2904, advertiser(s) 2924, mapping server 2926, and the a database of neighbors 2928 (e.g., occupant data), according to one embodiment.  The
privacy server 2900 may contain a social community module 2906, a search module 2908, a claimable module 2910, a commerce module 4212 and a map module 2914.  The neighborhood may include a user 2916, a community center 2920, a residence 2918, a neighbor
2920 and a business 2922, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> The privacy server 2900 may include any number of neighborhoods having registered users and/or unregistered users.  The neighborhood(s) 2902 may be a geographically localized community in a larger city, town, and/or suburb.  The network 2904 may
be search engines, blogs, social networks, professional networks and static website that may unite individuals, groups and/or community.  The social community module 2906 may generate a building creator in which the registered users may create and/or
modify empty claimable profiles (e.g., a claimable profile 4006 of FIG. 40A-12B, a claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, a claimable profile 1704 of FIG. 17).  The search module 2908 may include searching of information of an individual, group and/or
community.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30), as a function/module of the emergency response server, may determine the
location of the user 2916, the distance between the user 2916 and other verified users (e.g., the verified user 4110 of FIG. 41A), and the distance between the user 2916 and locations of interest.  With that information, the social community module 2906
(e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may further determine which verified users (e.g., the verified user 4110 of FIG. 41A) are within a predetermined vicinity
of a user 2916.  This set of verified users within the vicinity of another verified user may then be determined to be receptive to broadcasts transmitted by the user 2916 and to be available as transmitters of broadcasts to the user 2916.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) in effect may create a link between verified users of the network 2904 that
allows the users to communicate with each other, and this link may be based on the physical distance between the users as measured relative to a current geospatial location of the device (e.g., the device 1806, the device 1808 of FIG. 18) with a claimed
and verified (e.g., through a verification mechanism such as a postcard verification, a utility bill verification, and/or a vouching of the user with other users) non-transitory location (e.g., a home location, a work location) of the user and/or other
users.  In an alternate embodiment, the transitory location of the user (e.g., their current location, a current location of their vehicle and/or mobile phone) and/or the other users may also be used by the radial algorithm (e.g., the Bezier curve
algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30) to determine an appropriate threshold distance for broadcasting a message.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may automatically update a set of pages associated with profiles
of individuals and/or businesses that have not yet joined the network based on preseeded address information.  In effect, the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in
concert as described in FIG. 30) may update preseeded pages in a geo-constrained radial distance from where a broadcast originates (e.g., using an epicenter 4244 calculated from the current location of the device (e.g., the device 1806, the device 1808
of FIG. 18) (e.g., a a mobile version of the device 1806 of FIG. 18 (e.g., a mobile phone, a tablet computer) with information about the neighborhood broadcast data.  In effect, through this methodology, the social community module 2906 (e.g., that
applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may leave `inboxes` and/or post `alerts` on pages created for users that have not yet signed up based on a confirmed address of the
users through a public and/or a private data source (e.g., from Infogroup.RTM., from a white page directory, etc.).
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) of the privacy server 2900 may be different from previous implementations
because it is the first implementation to simulate the experience of local radio transmission between individuals using the internet and non-radio network technology by basing their network broadcast range on the proximity of verified users to one
another, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> The Bezier curve algorithm 3040 may operate as follows, according to one embodiment.  The radial algorithm (e.g., the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30) may utilize a radial distribution function (e.g., a pair correlation function) g(r)
<br/><br/> In the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950.  The radial distribution function may describe how density varies as a function of distance from a user 2916, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> If a given user 2916 is taken to be at the origin O (e.g., the epicenter 4244), and if .rho.=N/V is the average number density of recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29)
in the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950, then the local time-averaged density at a distance r from O is .rho.g(r) according to one embodiment.  This simplified definition may hold for a homogeneous and isotropic type of recipients (e.g., other
users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29), according to one embodiment of the Bezier curve algorithm 3040.
<br/><br/> A more anisotropic distribution (e.g., exhibiting properties with different values when measured in different directions) of the recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29)
will be described below, according to one embodiment of the Bezier curve algorithm 3040.  In simplest terms it may be a measure of the probability of finding a recipient at a distance of r away from a given user 2916, relative to that for an ideal
distribution scenario, according to one embodiment.  The anisotropic algorithm involves determining how many recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29) are within a distance of r
and r+dr away from the user 2916, according to one embodiment.  The Bezier curve algorithm 3040 may be determined by calculating the distance between all user pairs and binning them into a user histogram, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> The histogram may then be normalized with respect to an ideal user at the origin o, where user histograms are completely uncorrelated, according to one embodiment.  For three dimensions (e.g., such as a building representation in the privacy
server 2900 in which there are multiple residents in each floor), this normalization may be the number density of the system multiplied by the volume of the spherical shell, which mathematically can be expressed as g(r).sub.I=4.pi.r.sup.2.rho.dr, where
.rho.  may be the user density, according to one embodiment of the Bezier curve algorithm 3040.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution function of the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 can be computed either via computer simulation methods like the Monte Carlo method, or via the Ornstein-Zernike equation, using approximative closure relations like the
Percus-Yevick approximation or the Hypernetted Chain Theory, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> This may be important because by confining the broadcast reach of a verified user in the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 to a specified range, the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of
FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may replicate the experience of local radio broadcasting and enable verified users to communicate information to their immediate neighbors as well as receive information from
their immediate neighbors in areas that they care about, according to one embodiment.  Such methodologies can be complemented with hyperlocal advertising targeted to potential users of the privacy server 2900 on preseeded profile pages and/or active user
pages of the privacy server 2900.  Advertisement communications thus may become highly specialized and localized resulting in an increase in their value and interest to the local verified users of the network through the privacy server 2900.  For
example, advertisers may wish to communicate helpful home security devices to a set of users located in a geospatial area with a high concentration of home break-in broadcasts.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may also have wide application as it may solve the problem of trying to locate
a receptive audience to a verified user's broadcasts, whether that broadcast may a personal emergency, an one's personal music, an advertisement for a car for sale, a solicitation for a new employee, and/or a recommendation for a good restaurant in the
area.  This social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may eliminate unnecessarily broadcasting that information to those who are not
receptive to it, both as a transmitter and as a recipient of the broadcast.  The radial algorithm (e.g., the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30) saves both time (which may be critical and limited in an emergency context) and effort of every user
involved by transmitting information only to areas that a user cares about, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> In effect, the radial algorithm (e.g., the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30) of the emergency response server enables users to notify people around locations that are cared about (e.g., around where they live, work, and/or where they are
physically located).  In one embodiment, the user 2916 can be provided `feedback` and/or a communication that the neighbor 2928 may be responding to the emergency after the neighborhood broadcast data may be delivered to the recipients (e.g., other users
of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29) and/or to the neighborhood services using the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules
working in concert as described in FIG. 30) of the privacy server 2900.  For example, after the neighborhood broadcast data may be delivered, the device (e.g., the device 1806, the device 1808 of FIG. 18) (e.g., a mobile version of the device 1806 of
FIG. 18 (e.g., a mobile phone, a tablet computer)) may display a message saying: "3256 neighbors around a 1 radius from you have been notified on their profile pages of your crime broadcast in Menlo Park and 4 people are responding" and/or "8356
neighbors and two hospitals around a 2.7 radius from you have been notified of your medical emergency."
<br/><br/> The various embodiments described herein of the privacy server 2900 using the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may
solve a central problem of internet radio service providers (e.g., Pandora) by retaining cultural significance related to a person's locations of association.  For example, the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm
3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may be used to `create` new radio stations, television stations, and/or mini alert broadcasts to a geospatially constrained area on one end, and provide a means for
those `tuning in` to consume information posted in a geospatial area that the listener cares about and/or associates themselves with.  The information provided can be actionable in that the user 2916 may be able to secure new opportunities through face
to face human interaction and physical meeting not otherwise possible in internet radio scenarios.
<br/><br/> The radial algorithm (e.g., the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30) may be a set of instructions that may enable users (e.g., verified users, non-verified users) of the Nextdoor.com and Fatdoor.com websites and applications to broadcast
their activities (e.g., garage sale, t-shirt sale, crime alert) to surrounding neighbors within a claimed neighborhood and to guests of a claimed neighborhood, according to one embodiment.  The radial algorithm (e.g., the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of
FIG. 30) may be new because current technology does not allow for users of a network (e.g., Nextdoor.com, Fatdoor.com) to locally broadcast their activity to a locally defined geospatial area.  With the radial algorithm (e.g., the Bezier curve algorithm
3040 of FIG. 30), users of the network may communicate with one another in a locally defined manner, which may present more relevant information and activities, according to one embodiment.  For example, if a verified user of the network broadcasts an
emergency, locally defined neighbors of the verified user may be much more interested in responding than if they observed an emergency on a general news broadcast on traditional radio, according to one embodiment.  The social community module 2906 may
solve the problem of neighbors living in the locally defined geospatial area who don't typically interact, and allows them to connect within a virtual space that did not exist before, according to one embodiment.  Community boards (e.g., stolen or
missing item boards) may have been a primary method of distributing content in a surrounding neighborhood effectively prior to the disclosures described herein.  However, there was no way to easily distribute content related to exigent circumstances
and/or with urgency in a broadcast-like manner to those listening around a neighborhood through mobile devices until the various embodiments applying the social community module 2906 as described herein.
<br/><br/> A Bezier curve algorithm 3040 may be a method of calculating a sequence of operations, and in this case a sequence of radio operations, according to one embodiment.  Starting from an initial state and initial input, the Bezier curve algorithm
3040 describes a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing radial patterned distribution (e.g., simulating a local radio station), according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> The privacy server 2900 may solve technical challenges through the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) by implementing
a vigorous screening process to screen out any lewd or vulgar content in one embodiment.  For example, what may be considered lewd content sometimes could be subjective, and verified users could argue that the operator of the privacy server 2900 is
restricting their constitutional right to freedom of speech (e.g., if the emergency response server is operated by a government entity) through a crowd-moderation capability enabled by the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve
algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30), according to one embodiment.  In one embodiment, verified users may sign an electronic agreement to screen their content and agree that the neighborhood
communication system 2950 2950 may delete any content that it deems inappropriate for broadcasting, through the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as
described in FIG. 30) according to one embodiment.  For example, it may be determined that a lost item such as a misplaced set of car keys does not qualify as an "emergency" that should be broadcast.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30), in addition to neighborhood broadcasts (e.g., such as emergency broadcasts),
may allow verified users to create and broadcast their own radio show, e.g., music, talk show, commercial, instructional contents, etc., and to choose their neighborhood(s) for broadcasting based on a claimed location, according to one embodiment.  The
social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may allow users to choose the neighborhoods that they would want to receive the broadcasts,
live and recorded broadcasts, and/or the types and topics (e.g., minor crimes, property crimes, medical emergencies) of broadcasts that interest them.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) based approach of the privacy server 2900 may be a completely different concept
from the currently existing neighborhood (e.g., geospatial) social networking options.  The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30)
may also allow the user to create his/her own radio station, television station and/or other content such as the neighborhood broadcast data and distribute this content around locations to users and preseeded profiles around them.  For example, the user
may wish to broadcast their live reporting of a structure fire or interview eye-witnesses to a robbery.  The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as
described in FIG. 30) can allow verified users to create their content and broadcast in the selected geospatial area.  It also allows verified listeners to listen to only the relevant local broadcasts of their choice.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may be important because it may provide any verified user the opportunity to
create his/her own radial broadcast message (e.g., can be audio, video, pictorial and/or textual content) and distribute this content to a broad group.  Social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a
series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may also allow verified listeners to listen to any missed live broadcasts through the prerecorded features, according to one embodiment.  Through this, the social community module 2906 (e.g.,
that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) changes the way social networks (e.g., Nextdoor.RTM., Fatdoor.RTM., Facebook.RTM., Path.RTM., etc.) operate by enabling location
centric broadcasting to regions that a user cares about, according to one embodiment.  Social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may
solve a technical challenge by defining ranges based on a type of an emergency type, a type of neighborhood, and/or boundary condition of a neighborhood by analyzing whether the neighborhood broadcast data may be associated with a particular kind of
recipient, a particular neighborhood, a temporal limitation, and/or through another criteria.
<br/><br/> By using the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) of the privacy server 2900 the user 2916 may be able to filter
irrelevant offers and information provided by broadcasts.  In one embodiment, only the broadcasting user (e.g., the user 2916) may be a verified user to create accountability for a particular broadcast and/or credibility of the broadcaster.  In this
embodiment, recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29) of the broadcast may not need to be verified users of the emergency response network.  By directing traffic and organizing the
onslaught of broadcasts, the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) of the privacy server 2900 may be able to identify the origins
and nature of each group of incoming information and locate recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29) that are relevant/interested in the neighborhood broadcast data, maximizing
the effective use of each broadcast.  For example, the neighbor 2928 may be able to specify that they own a firearm so that they would be a relevant neighbor 2928 for broadcast data to respond to a school shooting.  In another example, a neighbor 2928
may specify that they are a medical professional (e.g., paramedic, physician) such that they may receive medical emergency broadcasts, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) of the privacy server 2900 may process the input data from the device (e.g.,
the device 1806, the device 1808 of FIG. 18) (e.g., a mobile version of the device 1806 of FIG. 18 (e.g., a mobile phone, a tablet computer)) in order to identify which notification(s) to broadcast to which individual(s).  This may be separate from a
traditional radio broadcast as it not only geographically constrains broadcasters and recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29) but also makes use of user preferences in order to
allow broadcasters to target an optimal audience and allow recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29) to alter and customize what they consume.  The user 2916 may associate
him/herself with a non-transitory address in order to remain constantly connected to their neighborhood and/or neighbors even when they themselves or their neighbors are away.  The Bezier curve algorithm 3040 may be also unique from a neighborhood social
network (e.g., the privacy server 2900) as it permits users to broadcast emergencies, information, audio, video etc. to other users, allowing users to create their own stations.
<br/><br/> In order to implement the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30), geospatial data may need to be collected and amassed in
order to create a foundation on which users may sign up and verify themselves by claiming a specific address, associating themselves with that geospatial location.  The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of
FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may then be able to utilize the geospatial database 2922 to filter out surrounding noise and deliver only relevant data to recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood
communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29).  In order to accomplish this, the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in
FIG. 30) may be able to verify the reliability of geospatial coordinates, time stamps, and user information associated with the device (e.g., the device 1806, the device 1808 of FIG. 18) (e.g., a a mobile version of the device 1806 of FIG. 18 (e.g., a
mobile phone, a tablet computer)).  In addition, threshold geospatial radii, private neighborhood boundaries, and personal preferences may be established in the privacy server 2900 and accommodated using the social community module 2906 (e.g., that
applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30).  The geospatial database 2922 may work in concert with the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve
algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) to store, organize, and manage broadcasts, pushpins, user profiles, preseeded user profiles, metadata, and epicenter 4244 locations associated with the
privacy server 2900 (e.g., a neighborhood social network such as Fatdoor.com, Nextdoor.com).
<br/><br/> The Bezier curve algorithm 3040 may be used to calculate relative distances between each one of millions of records as associated with each placed geo-spatial coordinate in the privacy server 2900 (e.g., a neighborhood social network such as
Fatdoor.com, Nextdoor.com).  Calculations of relative distance between each geospatial coordinate can be a large computational challenge because of the high number of reads, writes, modify, and creates associated with each geospatial coordinate added to
the privacy server 2900 and subsequent recalculations of surrounding geospatial coordinates associated with other users and/or other profile pages based a relative distance away from a newly added set of geospatial coordinates (e.g., associated with the
neighborhood broadcast data and/or with other pushpin types).  To overcome this computational challenge, the radial algorithm (e.g., the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30) may leverage a massively parallel computing architecture 4246 through which
processing functions are distributed across a large set of processors accessed in a distributed computing system 4248 through the network 2904.
<br/><br/> In order to achieve the utilization of the massively parallel computing architecture 4246 in a context of a radial distribution function of a privacy server 2900, a number of technical challenges have been overcome in at least one embodiment. 
Particularly, the social community module 2906 constructs a series of tables based on an ordered geospatial ranking based on frequency of interaction through a set of `n` number of users simultaneously interacting with the privacy server 2900, in one
preferred embodiment.  In this manner, sessions of access between the privacy server 2900 and users of the privacy server 2900 (e.g., the user 2916) may be monitored based on geospatial claimed areas of the user (e.g., a claimed work and/or home location
of the user), and/or a present geospatial location of the user.  In this manner, tables associated with data related to claimed geospatial areas of the user and/or the present geospatial location of the user may be anticipatorily cached in the memory
2924 to ensure that a response time of the privacy server 2900 may be not constrained by delays caused by extraction, retrieval, and transformation of tables that are not likely to be required for a current and/or anticipated set of sessions between
users and the privacy server 2900.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, an elastic computing environment may be used by the social community module 2906 to provide for increase/decreases of capacity within minutes of a database function requirement.  In this manner, the social community
module 2906 can adapt to workload changes based on number of requests of processing simultaneous and/or concurrent requests associated with neighborhood broadcast data by provisioning and de-provisioning resources in an autonomic manner, such that at
each point in time the available resources match the current demand as closely as possible.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may be a concept whereby a server communicating data to a dispersed group of
recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29) over a network 2904, which may be an internet protocol based wide area network (as opposed to a network communicating by radio frequency
communications) communicates that data only to a geospatially-constrained group of recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29).  The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies
the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may apply a geospatial constraint related to a radial distance away from an origin point, or a constraint related to regional, state,
territory, county, municipal, neighborhood, building, community, district, locality, and/or other geospatial boundaries.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may be new as applied to data traveling over wide area networks using internet
protocol topology in a geospatial social networking and commerce context, according to one embodiment.  While radio broadcasts, by their nature, are transmitted in a radial pattern surrounding the origin point, there may be no known mechanism for
restricting access to the data only to verified users of a service subscribing to the broadcast.  As applied to wired computer networks, while techniques for applying geospatial constraints have been applied to search results, and to other limited uses,
there has as yet been no application of geospatial constraint as applied to the various embodiments described herein using the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working
in concert as described in FIG. 30).
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may be roughly analogous to broadcast radio communications such as a) in
broadcast radio, b) in wireless computer networking, and c) in mobile telephony.  However, all of these systems broadcast their information promiscuously, making the data transmitted available to anyone within range of the transmitter who may be equipped
with the appropriate receiving device.  In contrast, the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) herein describes a system in which
networks are used to transmit data in a selective manner in that information may be distributed around a physical location of homes or businesses in areas of interest/relevancy.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may solve a problem of restricting data transmitted over networks to specific
users who are within a specified distance from the individual who originates the data.  In a broad sense, by enabling commerce and communications that are strictly limited within defined neighborhood boundaries, the social community module 2906 (e.g.,
that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may enable the privacy server 2900 (e.g., a neighborhood social network such as Fatdoor.com, Nextdoor.com) communications,
attacking the serious social conditions of anonymity and disengagement in community that afflict the nation and, increasingly, the world.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may comprise one or more modules that instruct the privacy server 2900 to
restrict the broadcasting of the neighborhood broadcast data to one or more parts of the geospatial area 117.  For example, in the embodiment of FIG. 29, the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30
using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may instruct the privacy server 2900 to broadcast the neighborhood broadcast data to the recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as
neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29) but not to the area outside the threshold radial distance 4219.
<br/><br/> In one or more embodiments, the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may allow the privacy server 2900 to function in
manner that simulates a traditional radio broadcast (e.g., using a radio tower to transmit a radio frequency signal) in that both the privacy server 2900 and the radio broadcast are restricted in the geospatial scope of the broadcast transmission.  In
one or more embodiments, the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may prevent the broadcast of the neighborhood broadcast data to
any geospatial area to which the user 2916 does not wish to transmit the neighborhood broadcast data, and/or to users that have either muted and/or selectively subscribed to a set of broadcast feeds.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may analyze the neighborhood broadcast data to determine which recipients
(e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29) may receive notification data 4212 within the threshold radial distance 4219 (e.g., set by the user 2916 and/or auto calculated based on a type of
emergency posting).  The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may use a variety of parameters, including information associated
with the neighborhood broadcast data (e.g., location of the broadcast, type of broadcast, etc.) to determine the threshold radial distance 4219.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may also determine which verified addresses associated with recipients (e.g.,
other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29) having verified user profiles are located within the threshold radial distance 4219.  The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve
algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may then broadcast the notification data 4212 to the profiles and/or mobile devices of the verified users having verified addresses within the threshold
radial distance 4219.
<br/><br/> The social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may therefore simulate traditional radio broadcasting (e.g., from a radio
station transmission tower) over the IP network.  Thus, the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may allow the broadcast to
include information and data that traditional radio broadcasts may not be able to convey, for example geospatial coordinates and/or real-time bi-directional communications.  Additionally, the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier
curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may allow individual users low-entry broadcast capability without resort to expensive equipment and/or licensing by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC).
<br/><br/> Another advantage of this broadcast via the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may be that it may bypass obstructions
that traditionally disrupt radio waves such as mountains and/or atmospheric disturbances.  Yet another advantage of the social community module 2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in
concert as described in FIG. 30) may be that it may expand the physical distance of broadcast capability without resort to the expense ordinarily associated with generating powerful carrier signals.  In yet another advantage, the social community module
2906 (e.g., that applies the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 using a series of modules working in concert as described in FIG. 30) may allow for almost unlimited channels and/or stations as compared to traditional radio where only a narrow band of
electromagnetic radiation has been appropriated for use among a small number of entities by government regulators (e.g., the FCC).
<br/><br/> The claimable module 2910 may enable the registered users to create and/or update their information.  A `claimable` (e.g., may be enabled through the claimable module 2910) can be defined as a perpetual collective work of many authors.  Similar
to a blog in structure and logic, a claimable allows anyone to edit, delete or modify content that has been placed on the Web site using a browser interface, including the work of previous authors.  In contrast, a blog (e.g., or a social network page),
typically authored by an individual, may not allow visitors to change the original posted material, only add comments to the original content.  The term claimable refers to either the web site or the software used to create the site.  The term
`claimable` also implies fast creation, ease of creation, and community approval in many software contexts (e.g., claimable means "quick" in Hawaiian).
<br/><br/> The commerce module 4212 may provide an advertisement system to a business that may enable the users to purchase location in the neighborhood(s) 2902.  The map module 2914 may be indulged in study, practice, representing and/or generating maps,
or globes.  The user 2916 may be an individuals and/or households that may purchase and/or use goods and services and/or be an active member of any group or community and/or resident and/or a part of any neighborhood(s) 2902.  The residence 2918 may be a
house, a place to live and/or like a nursing home in a neighborhood(s) 2902.
<br/><br/> The community center 2920 may be public locations where members of a community may gather for group activities, social support, public information, and other purposes.  The business 2922 may be a customer service, finance, sales, production,
communications/public relations and/or marketing organization that may be located in the neighborhood(s) 2902.  The advertiser(s) 2924 may be an individual and/or a firm drawing public who may be responsible in encouraging the people attention to goods
and/or services by promoting businesses, and/or may perform through a variety of media.  The mapping server 2926 may contain the details/maps of any area, region and/or neighborhood.  The social community module 2906 of the privacy server 2900 may
communicate with the neighborhood(s) 2902 through the network 2904 and/or the search module 2908.  The social community module 2906 of the privacy server 2900 may communicate with the advertiser(s) 2924 through the commerce module, the database of
neighbors 2928 (e.g., occupant data) and/or mapping server 2926 through the map module 2914.
<br/><br/> For example, the neighborhoods 2902A-N may have registered users and/or unregistered users of a privacy server 2900.  Also, the social community module 2906 of the privacy server 2900 may generate a building creator (e.g., building builder 1602
of FIG. 16) in which the registered users may create and/or modify empty claimable profiles, building layouts, social network pages, and/or floor levels structures housing residents and/or businesses in the neighborhood.
<br/><br/> In addition, the claimable module 2910 of the privacy server 2900 may enable the registered users to create a social network page of themselves, and/or may edit information associated with the unregistered users identifiable through a viewing of
physical properties in which, the unregistered users reside when the registered users have knowledge of characteristics associated with the unregistered users.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the search module 2908 of the privacy server 2900 may enable a people search (e.g., the people search widget 3100 of FIG. 31), a business search (e.g., the business search module 3102 of FIG. 31), and/or a category search (e.g., the
category search widget 3104 of FIG. 31) of any data in the social community module 2906 and/or may enable embedding of any content in the privacy server 2900 in other search engines, blogs, social networks, professional networks and/or static websites.
<br/><br/> The commerce module 4212 of the privacy server 2900 may provide an advertisement system to a business who purchase their location in the privacy server 2900 in which the advertisement may be viewable concurrently with a map indicating a location
of the business, and/or in which revenue may be attributed to the privacy server 2900 when the registered users and/or the unregistered users click-in on a simultaneously displayed data of the advertisement along with the map indicating a location of the
business.
<br/><br/> Moreover, a map module 2914 of the privacy server 2900 may include a map data associated with a satellite data (e.g., generated by the satellite data module 3400 of FIG. 34) which may serve as a basis of rendering the map in the privacy server
2900 and/or which includes a simplified map generator which may transform the map to a fewer color and/or location complex form using a parcel data which identifies some residence, civic, and/or business locations in the satellite data.
<br/><br/> In addition, a first instruction set may enable a social network to reside above a map data, in which the social network may be associated with specific geographical locations identifiable in the map data.  Also, a second instruction set
integrated with the first instruction set may enable users of the social network to create profiles of other people through a forum which provides a free form of expression of the users sharing information about any entities and/or people residing in any
geographical location identifiable in the satellite map data, and/or to provide a technique of each of the users to claim a geographic location (e.g., a geographic location 29024 of FIG. 40A) to control content in their respective claimed geographic
locations (e.g., a geographic location 29024 of FIG. 40A).
<br/><br/> Furthermore, a third instruction set integrated with the first instruction set and the second instruction set may enable searching of people in the privacy server 2900 by indexing each of the data shared by the user 2916 of any of the people
and/or the entities residing in any geographic location (e.g., a geographic location 29024 of FIG. 40A).  A fourth instruction set may provide a moderation of content about each other posted of the users 2916 through trusted users of the privacy server
2900 who have an ability to ban specific users and/or delete any offensive and libelous content in the privacy server 2900.
<br/><br/> Also, a fifth instruction set may enable an insertion of any content generated in the privacy server 2900 in other search engines through a syndication and/or advertising relationship between the privacy server 2900 and/or other internet
commerce and search portals.
<br/><br/> Moreover, a sixth instruction set may grow the social network through neighborhood groups, local politicians, block watch communities, issue activism groups, and neighbor(s) 2920 who invite other known parties and/or members to share profiles of
themselves and/or learn characteristics and information about other supporters and/or residents in a geographic area of interest through the privacy server 2900.
<br/><br/> Also, a seventh instruction set may determine quantify an effect on at least one of a desirability of a location, a popularity of a location, and a market value of a location based on an algorithm that considers a number of demographic and
social characteristics of a region surrounding the location through a reviews module.
<br/><br/> FIG. 30 is an exploded view of the social community module 2906 of FIG. 29, according to one embodiment.  Particularly FIG. 30 illustrates a building builder module 3000, an N.sup.th degree module 3002, a tagging module 3004, a verify module
3006, a groups generator module 3008, a pushpin module 3010, a profile module 3012, an announce module 3014, a people database 3016, a places database 3018, a business database 3020, a friend finder module 3022 and a neighbor-neighbor help module 3024,
according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> The N.sup.th degree module 3002 may enable the particular registered user to communicate with an unknown registered user through a common registered user who may be a friend and/or a member of a common community.  The tagging module 3004 may
enable the user 2916 to leave brief comments on each of the claimable profiles (e.g., the claimable profile 4006 of FIG. 40A-12B, the claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, the claimable profile 1704 of FIG. 17) and social network pages in the global
neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29).
<br/><br/> The verify module 3006 may validate the data, profiles and/or email addresses received from various registered user(s) before any changes may be included.  The groups generator module 3008 may enable the registered users to form groups may be
depending on common interest, culture, style, hobbies and/or caste.  The pushpin module 3010 may generate customized indicators of different types of users, locations, and interests directly in the map.  The profile module 3012 may enable the user to
create a set of profiles of the registered users and to submit media content of themselves, identifiable through a map.
<br/><br/> The announce module 3014 may distribute a message in a specified range of distance away from the registered users when a registered user purchases a message to communicate to certain ones of the registered users surrounding a geographic vicinity
adjacent to the particular registered user originating the message.  The people database 3016 may keep records of the visitor/users (e.g., a user 2916 of FIG. 29).  The places database module 3018 may manage the data related to the location of the user
(e.g., address of the registered user).  The business database 3020 may manage an extensive list of leading information related to business.  The friend finder module 3022 may match the profile of the registered user with common interest and/or help the
registered user to get in touch with new friends or acquaintances.
<br/><br/> For example, the verify module 3006 of the social community module 2906 of FIG. 29 may authenticate an email address of a registered user prior to enabling the registered user to edit information associated with the unregistered users through an
email response and/or a digital signature technique.  The groups generator module 3008 of the social community module (e.g., the social community module 2906 of FIG. 29) may enable the registered users to form groups with each other surrounding at least
one of a common neighborhood (e.g., a neighborhood 2902A-N of FIG. 29), political, cultural, educational, professional and/or social interest.
<br/><br/> In addition, the tagging module 3004 of the social community module (e.g., the social community module 2906 of FIG. 29) may enable the registered users and/or the unregistered users to leave brief comments on each of the claimable profiles
(e.g., the claimable profile 4006 of FIG. 40A-12B, the claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, the claimable profile 1704 of FIG. 17) and/or social network pages in the global neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29), in which
the brief comments may be simultaneously displayed when a pointing device rolls over a pushpin indicating a physical property associated with any of the registered users and/or the unregistered users.  Also, the pushpin module 3010 of the social
community module 2906 of FIG. 29 may be generating customized indicators of different types of users, locations, and/or interests directly in the map.
<br/><br/> Further, the announce module 3014 of the social community module 2906 of FIG. 29 may distribute a message in a specified range of distance away from the registered users when a registered user purchases a message to communicate to certain ones
of the registered users surrounding a geographic vicinity adjacent to the particular registered user originating the message, wherein the particular registered user purchases the message through a governmental currency and/or a number of tokens collected
by the particular user (e.g. the user 2916 of FIG. 29) through a creation of content in the global neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29).
<br/><br/> In addition, the N.sup.th degree module 3002 of the social community module 2906 of FIG. 29 may enable the particular registered user to communicate with an unknown registered user through a common registered user known by the particular
registered user and/or the unknown registered user that is an N.sup.th degree of separation away from the particular registered user and/or the unknown registered user.
<br/><br/> Moreover, the profile module 3012 of the social community module 2906 of FIG. 29 may create a set of profiles of each one of the registered users and to enable each one of the registered users to submit media content of themselves, other
registered users, and unregistered users identifiable through the map.

user 2916 of FIG. 29) to find the companies, products, services, and/or business related information they need to know about.
<br/><br/> The category search widget 3104 may narrow down searches from a broader scope (e.g., if one is interested in information from a particular center, one can go to the category under the center and enter one's query there and it will return results
from that particular category only).  The communication module 3106 may provide/facilitate multiple by which one can communicate, people to communicate with, and subjects to communicate about among different members of the global neighborhood environment
1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29).
<br/><br/> The directory assistance module 3108 may provide voice response assistance to users (e.g., the user 2916 of FIG. 29) assessable through a web and telephony interface of any category, business and search queries of user's of any search engine
contents.  The embedding module 3110 may automatically extract address and/or contact info from other social networks, search engines, and content providers.
<br/><br/> The no-match module 3112 may request additional information from a verified registered user (e.g., a verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, a verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 16) about a person, place, and business having no listing
in the global neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29) when no matches are found in a search query of the verified registered user (e.g., a verified registered user 4110 of FIG. 41A-B, a verified registered user 4110 of
FIG. 16).
<br/><br/> The chat widget 3116 may provide people to chat online, which is a way of communicating by broadcasting messages to people on the same site in real time.  The group announcement widget 3118 may communicate with a group and/or community in may be
by Usenet, Mailing list, calling and/or E-mail message sent to notify subscribers.  The Voice over IP widget 3120 may help in routing of voice conversations over the Internet and/or through any other IP-based network.  The communication module 3106 may
communicate directly with the people search widget 300, the business search module 3102, the category search widget 3104, the directory assistance module 3108, the embedding module 3110 may communicate with the no-match module 3112 through the range
selector module 3114.
<br/><br/> For example, a search module 2908 of the global neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29) may enable the people search, the business search, and the category search of any data in the social community module (e.g.,
the social community module 2906 of FIG. 29) and/or may enable embedding of any content in the global neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29) in other search engines, blogs, social networks, professional networks and/or
static websites.
<br/><br/> In addition, the communicate module 3106 of the search module 2906 may enable voice over internet, live chat, and/or group announcement functionality in the global neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29) among
different members of the global neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29).
<br/><br/> Also, the directory assistance module 3108 of the search module 2908 may provide voice response assistance to users (e.g., the user 2916 of FIG. 29) assessable through a web and/or telephony interface of any category, business, community, and
residence search queries of users (e.g., the user 2916 of FIG. 29) of any search engine embedding content of the global neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29).
<br/><br/> The embedding module 3110 of the search module 2908 may automatically extract address and/or contact info from other social networks, search engines, and content providers, and/or to enable automatic extraction of group lists from contact
databases of instant messaging platforms.

module 3220, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> The user-place claimable module 3200 may manage the information of the user (e.g., the user 2916 of FIG. 29) location in the global neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29).  The user-user claimable module 3202
may manage the user (e.g., the user 2916 of FIG. 29) to view a profile of another user and geographical location in the neighborhood.  The user-neighbor claimable module 3204 may manage the user (e.g., the users 2916 of FIG. 29) to view the profile of
the registered neighbor and/or may trace the geographical location of the user in the global neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29).  The user-business claimable module 3206 may manage the profile of the user (e.g., the
user 2916 of FIG. 29) managing a commercial business in the neighborhood environment.  The reviews module 3208 may provide remarks, local reviews and/or ratings of various businesses as contributed by the users (e.g., the user 2916 of FIG. 29) of the
global neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29).  The defamation prevention module 3210 may enable the registered users to modify the information associated with the unregistered users identifiable through the viewing of
the physical properties.
<br/><br/> The claimable-social network conversion module 3212 of the claimable module 2910 of FIG. 29 may transform the claimable profiles (e.g., the claimable profile 4006 of FIG. 40A-12B, the claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, the claimable profile
1704 of FIG. 17) to social network profiles when the registered users claim the claimable profiles (e.g., the claimable profile 4006 of FIG. 40A-12B, the claimable profile 4102 of FIG. 41A, the claimable profile 1704 of FIG. 17).
<br/><br/> The claim module 3214 may enable the unregistered users to claim the physical properties associated with their residence (e.g., the residence 2918 of FIG. 29).  The dispute resolution module 3218 may determine a legitimate user among different
unregistered users who claim a same physical property.  The media manage module 3220 may allow users (e.g., the user 2916 of FIG. 29) to manage and/or review a list any product from product catalog using a fully integrated, simple to use interface.
<br/><br/> The media manage module 3220 may communicate with the user-place claimable module 3200, user-place claimable module 3200, user-user claimable module 3202, the user-neighbor claimable module 3204 and the reviews module 3208 through user-business
claimable module 3206.  The user-place claimable module 3200 may communicate with the dispute resolution module 3218 through the claim module 3214.  The user-user claimable module 3202 may communicate with the data segment module 3216 through the
claimable-social network conversion module 3212.  The user-neighbor claimable module 3204 may communicate with the defamation prevention module 3210.  The user-business claimable module 3206 may communicate with the reviews module 3208.  The
claimable-social network conversion module 3212 may communicate with the claim module 3214.
<br/><br/> For example, the claimable module 2910 of the global neighborhood environment 1800 (e.g., the privacy server 2900 of FIG. 29) may enable the registered users to create the social network page of themselves, and may edit information associated
with the unregistered users identifiable through a viewing of physical properties in which the unregistered users reside when the registered users have knowledge of characteristics associated with the unregistered users.  Also, the claim module 3214 of
claimable module 2910 may enable the unregistered users to claim the physical properties associated with their residence.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the dispute resolution module 3218 of the claimable module 2910 may determine a legitimate user of different unregistered users who claim a same physical property.  The defamation prevention module 3210 of the claimable module 2910
may enable the registered users to modify the information associated with the unregistered users identifiable through the viewing of the physical properties, and/or to enable registered user voting of an accuracy of the information associated with the
unregistered users.

with the commerce server 4200 through the network 2904.  For example, the commerce server 4200 may be a computing system (e.g., or a group of computing systems) that operates in a larger client-server database framework (e.g., such as in a social
networking software such as Nextdoor.com, Fatdoor.com, Facebook.com, etc.).
<br/><br/> The data processing system 4204 (e.g., a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop) may access the commerce server 4200 through the network 2904 using a browser application of the data processing system (e.g., Google.RTM.  Chrome) and/or through a
client-side application downloaded to the data processing system 4204 (e.g., a Nextdoor.com mobile application, a Fatdoor.com mobile application) operated by the user 2916.  In an alternate embodiment, a non-mobile computing device, such as a desktop
computer (not shown) may access the commerce server 4200 through the network 2904.
<br/><br/> The broadcast data 4202 may be communicated from the data processing system 4204 to the commerce server 4200 through the network 2904.  The broadcast data 4202 may include information about a garage sale offered by the user 2916 to recipients
4214 through the network 2904.  For example, the work opportunity may relate to a paid position of regular employment offered by the user 2916 and/or a task, a casual/occasional garage sale offered by the user 2916 to the recipients 4214 and/or the
service providers 4209.
<br/><br/> The broadcast data 4202 may be generated and distributed through an application of the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) of the commerce server 4200.  The
radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may be a series of software functions/processes that simulates the experience of transmitting and receiving local broadcasts for
the verified user (e.g., the user 2916 that has claimed a geospatial location), according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> Using an internet protocol based network (e.g., the network 2904), the commerce server 4200 may be able to use the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) to
simulate a radio frequency (RF) based communication network using an IP network topology of the network 2904.  Therefore, the broadcast data 4202 can be distributed using the commerce server 4200 to a geo-constrained area (e.g., the recipients 4214 in
the geospatial area 4217 and/or the service providers 4209 in a geo-constrained area around an area in which the data processing system 4204 operates without requiring expensive broadcast towers, transceivers, transmitters, amplifiers, antennas, tuners
and/or wave generating and interpreting hardware (e.g., as may be required in local ham radio communication, frequency modulation (FM) audio systems, etc.).  The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series
of modules working in concert) may recreate an experience of communication between parties in a geospatially restricted area (e.g., for example in the same city, in the surrounding neighborhood, in the same zip code, in the same building, in the same
claimed neighborhood) through the use of an Internet protocol network.  The commerce server 4200 may overcome technical challenges of determining a user's geospatial location, calculating distance to other verified users based on relative geospatial
locations, and/or coordinating information with a database of geo-coded information of interest (e.g., using the geospatial database 4222) using the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules
working in concert).
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert), as a function/module of the commerce server, may determine the location of the user 2916, the distance between the
user 2916 and other verified users, and the distance between the user 2916 and locations of interest.  With that information, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert)
may further determine which verified users are within a predetermined vicinity of a user 2916.  This set of verified users within the vicinity of another verified user may then be determined to be receptive to broadcasts transmitted by the user 2916 and
to be available as transmitters of broadcasts to the user 2916.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) in effect may create a link between verified users of the network 2904 that allows the users to communicate with each
other, and this link may be based on the physical distance between the users as measured relative to a current geospatial location of the data processing system 4204 with a claimed and verified (e.g., through a verification mechanism such as a postcard
verification, a utility bill verification, and/or a vouching of the user with other users) non-transitory location (e.g., a home location, a work location) of the user and/or other users.  In an alternate embodiment, the transitory location of the user
(e.g., their current location, a current location of their vehicle and/or mobile phone) and/or the other users may also be used by the radial algorithm 4241 to determine an appropriate threshold distance for broadcasting a message.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may automatically update a set of pages associated with profiles of individuals and/or businesses that
have not yet joined the network based on preseeded address information.  In effect, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may update preseeded pages in a
geo-constrained radial distance from where a broadcast originates (e.g., using an epicenter 4244 calculated from the current location of the data processing system 4204) with information about the broadcast data 4202.  In effect, through this
methodology, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may leave `inboxes` and/or post `alerts` on pages created for users that have not yet signed up based on a
confirmed address of the users through a public and/or a private data source (e.g., from Infogroup.RTM., from a white page directory, etc.).
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) of the commerce server 4200 may be different from previous implementations because it is the first implementation to
simulate the experience of local radio transmission between individuals using the internet and non-radio network technology by basing their network broadcast range on the proximity of verified users to one another, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> FIG. 42 illustrates a number of operations between the data processing system 4204 and the recipients 4214 and/or the service providers 4209.  Particularly, circle 1' of FIG. 42 illustrates that the user of the data processing system 4204
communicates the broadcast data 4202 to the commerce server 4200 using the network 2904.  Then, after applying the radial algorithm 4241 utilizing the radial distribution module 4240, the commerce server 4200 generates and communicates an appropriate
notification data (e.g., the notification data 4212) associated with the broadcast data 4202 to a geospatially distributed set of recipients 4214 in a radial area (radius represented as `r` of FIG. 42) in a geospatial vicinity from an epicenter 4244
associated a present geospatial location with the data processing system 4204 as illustrated as circle `2` in FIG. 42.
<br/><br/> The radial algorithm 4241 may operate as follows, according to one embodiment.  The radial algorithm may utilize a radial distribution function (e.g., a pair correlation function) g(r)
<br/><br/> in the view of the community network 4250.  The radial distribution function may describe how density varies as a function of distance from a user 2916, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> If a given user 2916 is taken to be at the origin O (e.g., the epicenter 4244), and if .rho.=N/V is the average number density of recipients 4214 in the view of the community network view 4250, then the local time-averaged density at a distance
v from O is .rho.g(r) according to one embodiment.  This simplified definition may hold for a homogeneous and isotropic type of recipients 4214, according to one embodiment of the radial algorithm 4241.
<br/><br/> A more anisotropic distribution (e.g., exhibiting properties with different values when measured in different directions) of the recipients 4214 will be described below, according to one embodiment of the radial algorithm 4241.  In simplest
terms it may be a measure of the probability of finding a recipient at a distance of T away from a given user 2916, relative to that for an ideal distribution scenario, according to one embodiment.  The anisotropic algorithm involves determining how many
recipients 4214 are within a distance of r and r+dr away from the user 2916, according to one embodiment.  The radial algorithm 4241 may be determined by calculating the distance between all user pairs and binning them into a user histogram, according to
one embodiment.
<br/><br/> The histogram may then be normalized with respect to an ideal user at the origin o, where user histograms are completely uncorrelated, according to one embodiment.  For three dimensions (e.g., such as a building representation in the
geospatially constrained social network 4242 in which there are multiple residents in each floor), this normalization may be the number density of the system multiplied by the volume of the spherical shell, which mathematically can be expressed as
g(r).sub.I=4.pi.r.sup.2.rho.dr, where .rho.  may be the user density, according to one embodiment of the radial algorithm 4241.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution function of the radial algorithm 4241 can be computed either via computer simulation methods like the Monte Carlo method, or via the Ornstein-Zernike equation, using approximate closure relations like the Percus-Yevick
approximation or the Hypernetted Chain Theory, according to one embodiment
<br/><br/> This may be important because by confining the broadcast reach of a verified user in the view of the community network view 4250 to a specified range, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a
series of modules working in concert) may replicate the experience of local radio broadcasting and enable verified users to communicate information to their immediate neighbors as well as receive information from their immediate neighbors in areas that
they care about, according to one embodiment.  Such methodologies can be complemented with hyperlocal advertising targeted to potential users of the commerce server 4200 on preseeded profile pages and/or active user pages of the commerce server 4200. 
Advertisement communications thus may become highly specialized and localized resulting in an increase in their value and interest to the local verified users of the network through the commerce server 4200.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may solve the problem of trying to locate a receptive audience to a verified user's broadcasts, whether that
broadcast may be one's personal music, an advertisement for a car for sale, a solicitation for a new employee, and/or a recommendation for a good restaurant in the area.  This radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241
using a series of modules working in concert) may eliminate unnecessarily broadcasting that information to those who are not receptive to it, both as a transmitter and as a recipient of the broadcast.  The radial algorithm 4241 saves both time and effort
of every user involved by transmitting information only to areas that a user cares about, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> In effect, the radial algorithm 4241 of the commerce server 4200 enables users to notify people around locations that are cared about (e.g., around where they live, work, and/or where they are physically located).  In one embodiment, the user
2916 can be provided `feedback` after the broadcast data 4202 may be delivered to the recipients 4214 and/or to the service providers 4209 using the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules
working in concert) of the commerce server 4200.  For example, after the broadcast data 4202 may be delivered, the data processing system 4204 (e.g., a data processing system 504) may display a message saying: "3256 neighbors around a 1 mile radius from
you have been notified on their profile pages of your delivery notification in Menlo Park" and/or "8356 neighbors around a 1 mile radius from you have been notified of your request to rent an autonomous neighborhood vehicle."
<br/><br/> The various embodiments described herein of the commerce server 4200 using the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may solve a central problem of internet
radio service providers (e.g., Pandora) by retaining cultural significance related to a person's locations of association.  For example, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working
in concert) may be used to `create` new radio stations, television stations, and/or mini alert broadcasts to a geospatially constrained area on one end, and provide a means for those `tuning in` to consume information posted in a geospatial area that the
listener cares about and/or associates themselves with.  The information provided can be actionable in that the user 2916 may be able to secure new opportunities through face to face human interaction and physical meeting not otherwise possible in
internet radio scenarios.
<br/><br/> The radial algorithm 4241 may be a set of instructions that may enable users (e.g., verified users, non-verified users) of the Nextdoor.com and Fatdoor.com websites and applications to broadcast their activities (e.g., deliveries, pick-ups,
errands, garage sale, t-shirt sale, crime alert) to surrounding neighbors within a claimed neighborhood and to guests of a claimed neighborhood, according to one embodiment.  The radial algorithm 4241 may be new because current technology does not allow
for users of a network (e.g., Nextdoor.com, Fatdoor.com) to locally broadcast their activity to a locally defined geospatial area.  With the radial algorithm 4241, users of the network may communicate with one another in a locally defined manner, which
may present more relevant information and activities, according to one embodiment.  For example, if a verified user of the network broadcasts a task for the autonomous neighborhood vehicle, locally defined neighbors of the verified user may be much more
interested in the tasks and needs of individuals in their neighborhood compared to if the task was for someone or something in a different town or city, according to one embodiment.  The radial distribution module 4240 may solve the problem of neighbors
living in the locally defined geospatial area who don't typically interact, and allows them to connect within a virtual space that did not exist before, according to one embodiment.  Prior to this invention of the radial algorithm 4241 operating through
the radial distribution module 4240, community boards (e.g., job boards, for sale boards) were the only method of distributing content in a surrounding neighborhood effectively.  However, there was no way to easily distribute content related to exigent
circumstances and/or with urgency in a broadcast-like manner to those listening around a neighborhood through data processing systems until the various embodiments applying the radial distribution module 4240 as described herein.
<br/><br/> A radial algorithm 4241 may be a method of calculating a sequence of operations, and in this case a sequence of radio operations, according to one embodiment.  Starting from an initial state and initial input, the radial algorithm 4241 describes
a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing radial patterned distribution (e.g., simulating a local radio station), according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> The commerce server 4200 may solve technical challenges through the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) by implementing a vigorous screening process to
screen out any lewd or vulgar content in one embodiment.  For example, what may be considered lewd content sometimes could be subjective, and verified users could argue that we are restricting their constitutional right to freedom of speech through a
crowd-moderation capability enabled by the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert), according to one embodiment.  In one embodiment, verified users may sign an electronic
agreement to screen their content and agree that the view of the community network view 4250 may delete any content that it deems inappropriate for broadcasting, through the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241
using a series of modules working in concert) according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may allow verified users to create and broadcast their own radio show, e.g., music, talk show, commercial,
instructional contents, etc., and to choose their neighborhood(s) for broadcasting based on a claimed location, according to one embodiment.  The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules
working in concert) may allow users to choose the neighborhoods that they would want to receive the broadcasts, live and recorded broadcasts, and/or the types and topics of broadcasts that interest them.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) based approach of the commerce server 4200 may be a completely different concept from the currently existing
neighborhood (e.g. geospatial) social networking options.  The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may also allow the user to create his/her own radio station,
television station and/or other content such as the broadcast data 4202 and distribute this content around locations to users and preseeded profiles around them.  The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a
series of modules working in concert) can allow verified users to create their content and broadcast in the selected geospatial area.  It also allows verified listeners to listen to only the relevant local broadcasts of their choice.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may be important because it may provide any verified user the opportunity to create his/her own radial broadcast
message (e.g., can be audio, video, pictorial and/or textual content) and distribute this content to a broad group.  Radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may also
allow verified listeners to listen to any missed live broadcasts through the prerecorded features, according to one embodiment.  Through this, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules
working in concert) changes the way social networks (e.g., Nextdoor, Fatdoor, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Path, etc.) operate by enabling location centric broadcasting to regions that a user cares about, according to one embodiment.  Radial distribution module 4240 (e.g.,
that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may solve a technical challenge by defining ranges based on a type of job posting, a type of neighborhood, and/or boundary condition of a neighborhood by analyzing
whether the broadcast data 4202 may be associated with a particular kind of job, a particular neighborhood, a temporal limitation, and/or through another criteria.
<br/><br/> By using the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) of the commerce server 4200 the verified user 2916 may be able to filter irrelevant offers and information
provided by broadcasts.  In one embodiment, only the broadcasting user (e.g., the user 2916) may be a verified user to create accountability for a particular broadcast and/or credibility of the broadcaster.  In this embodiment, recipients 4214 of the
broadcast may not need to be verified users of the garage sale network.  By directing traffic and organizing the onslaught of broadcasts, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working
in concert) of the commerce server 4200 may able to identify the origins and nature of each group of incoming information and locate recipients 4214 that are relevant/interested in the broadcast data 4202, maximizing the effective use of each broadcast.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) of the commerce server 4200 may process the input data from the data processing system 4204 in order to identify
which notification(s) to broadcast to which individual(s).  This may be separate from a traditional radio broadcast as it not only geographically constrains broadcasters and recipients 4214 but also makes use of user preferences in order to allow
broadcasters to target an optimal audience and allow recipients 4214 to alter and customize what they consume.  The user 2916 may associate himself/herself with a non-transitory address in order to remain constantly connected to their neighborhood and/or
neighbors even when they themselves or their neighbors are away.  The radial algorithm 4241 may be also unique from a neighborhood social network (e.g., the geospatially constrained social network 4242) as it permits users to broadcast offers,
information, audio, video etc. to other users, allowing users to create their own stations.
<br/><br/> In order to implement the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert), geospatial data may need to be collected and amassed in order to create a foundation on which
users may sign up and verify themselves by claiming a specific address, associating themselves with that geospatial location.  The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert)
may then be able to utilize the geospatial database 4222 to filter out surrounding noise and deliver only relevant data to recipients 4214.  In order to accomplish this, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241
using a series of modules working in concert) may be able to verify the reliability of geospatial coordinates, time stamps, and user information associated with the data processing system 4204 (e.g., a data processing system 504).  In addition, threshold
geospatial radii, private neighborhood boundaries, and personal preferences may be established in the commerce server 4200 and accommodated using the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules
working in concert).  The geospatial database 4222 may work in concert with the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) to store, organize, and manage broadcasts,
pushpins, user profiles, preseeded user profiles, metadata, and epicenter 4244 locations associated with the geospatially constrained social network 4242 (e.g., a neighborhood social network such as Fatdoor.com, Nextdoor.com).
<br/><br/> The radial algorithm 4241 may be used to calculate relative distances between each one of millions of records as associated with each placed geo-spatial coordinate in the geospatially constrained social network 4242 (e.g., a neighborhood social
network such as Fatdoor.com, Nextdoor.com).  Calculations of relative distance between each geospatial coordinate can be a large computational challenge because of the high number of reads, writes, modifies, and creates associated with each geospatial
coordinate added to the geospatially constrained social network 4242 and subsequent recalculations of surrounding geospatial coordinates associated with other users and/or other profile pages based a relative distance away from a newly added set of
geospatial coordinates (e.g., associated with the broadcast data 4202 and/or with other pushpin types).  To overcome this computational challenge, the radial algorithm may leverage a massively parallel computing architecture 4246 through which processing
functions are distributed across a large set of processors accessed in a distributed computing system 4248 through the network 2904.
<br/><br/> In order to achieve the utilization of the massively parallel computing architecture 4246 in a context of a radial distribution function of a geospatially constrained social network 4242, a number of technical challenges have been overcome in at
least one embodiment.  Particularly, the radial distribution module 4240 constructs a series of tables based on an ordered geospatial ranking based on frequency of interaction through a set of `n` number of users simultaneously interacting with the
geospatially constrained social network 4242, in one preferred embodiment.  In this manner, sessions of access between the commerce server 4200 and users of the commerce server 4200 (e.g., the user 2916) may be monitored based on geospatial claimed areas
of the user (e.g., a claimed work and/or home location of the user), and/or a present geospatial location of the user.  In this manner, tables associated with data related to claimed geospatial areas of the user and/or the present geospatial location of
the user may be anticipatorily cached in the memory 4224 to ensure that a response time of the geospatially constrained social network 4242 may be not constrained by delays caused by extraction, retrieval, and transformation of tables that are not likely
to be required for a current and/or anticipated set of sessions between users and the commerce server 4200.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, an elastic computing environment may be used by the radial distribution module 4240 to provide for increase/decreases of capacity within minutes of a database function requirement.  In this manner, the radial
distribution module 4240 can adapt to workload changes based on number of requests of processing simultaneous and/or concurrent requests associated with broadcast data 4202 by provisioning and deprovisioning resources in an autonomic manner, such that at
each point in time the available resources match the current demand as closely as possible.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may be a concept whereby a server communicating data to a dispersed group of recipients 4214 over a network 2904,
which may be an internet protocol based wide area network (as opposed to a network communicating by radio frequency communications) communicates that data only to a geospatially-constrained group of recipients 4214.  The radial distribution module 4240
(e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may apply a geospatial constraint related to a radial distance away from an origin point, or a constraint related to regional, state, territory, county,
municipal, neighborhood, building, community, district, locality, and/or other geospatial boundaries.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may be new as applied to data traveling over wide area networks using internet protocol topology in a geospatial
social networking and commerce context, according to one embodiment.  While radio broadcasts, by their nature, are transmitted in a radial pattern surrounding the origin point, there may be no known mechanism for restricting access to the data only to
verified users of a service subscribing to the broadcast.  As applied to wired computer networks, while techniques for applying geospatial constraints have been applied to search results, and to other limited uses, there has as yet been no application of
geospatial constraint as applied to the various embodiments described herein using the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert).
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may be roughly analogous to broadcast radio communications such as a) in broadcast radio, b) in wireless computer
networking, and c) in mobile telephony.  However, all of these systems broadcast their information promiscuously, making the data transmitted available to anyone within range of the transmitter who may be equipped with the appropriate receiving device. 
In contrast, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) herein describes a system in which networks are used to transmit data in a selective manner in that information
may be distributed around a physical location of homes or businesses in areas of interest/relevancy.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may solve a problem of restricting data transmitted over networks to specific users who are within a specified
distance from the individual who originates the data.  In a broad sense, by enabling commerce and communications that are strictly limited within defined neighborhood boundaries, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial
algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may enable the geospatially constrained social network 4242 (e.g., a neighborhood social network such as Fatdoor.com, Nextdoor.com) communications, attacking the serious social conditions of
anonymity and disengagement in community that afflict the nation and, increasingly, the world.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may comprise one or more modules that instruct the commerce server 4200 to restrict the broadcasting of the broadcast
data 4202 to one or more parts of the geospatial area 4217.  For example, in the embodiment of FIG. 42, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may instruct the
commerce server 4200 to broadcast the broadcast data 4202 to the recipients 4214 but not to the area outside the threshold radial distance 4219.
<br/><br/> In one or more embodiments, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may allow the commerce server 4200 to function in manner that simulates a traditional
radio broadcast (e.g., using a radio tower to transmit a radio frequency signal) in that both the commerce server 4200 and the radio broadcast are restricted in the geospatial scope of the broadcast transmission.  In one or more embodiments, the radial
distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may prevent the broadcast of the broadcast data 4202 to any geospatial area to which the user 2916 does not wish to transmit the
broadcast data 4202, and/or to users that have either muted and/or selectively subscribed to a set of broadcast feeds.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may analyze the broadcast data 4202 to determine which recipients 4214 may receive notification data 4212 within a
threshold radial distance 4219 (e.g., set by the user 2916 and/or auto calculated based on a type of broadcast).  The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may use a
variety of parameters, including information associated with the broadcast data to determine the threshold radial distance 4219.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may also determine which verified addresses associated with recipients 4214 having verified user profiles are located
within the threshold radial distance 4219.  The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may then broadcast the notification data 4212 to the profiles and/or data
processing systems of the verified users having verified addresses within the threshold radial distance 4219.
<br/><br/> The radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may therefore simulate traditional radio broadcasting (e.g. from a radio station transmission tower) over the IP
network.  Thus, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may allow the broadcast to include information and data that traditional radio broadcasts may not be able to
convey, for example geospatial coordinates and/or real-time bi-directional communications.  Additionally, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may allow individual
users low-entry broadcast capability without resort to expensive equipment and/or licensing by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
<br/><br/> Another advantage of this broadcast via the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may be that it may bypass obstructions that traditionally disrupt radio waves
such as mountains and/or atmospheric disturbances.  Yet another advantage of the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may be that it may expand the physical distance
of broadcast capability without resort to the expense ordinarily associated with generating powerful carrier signals.  In yet another advantage, the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules
working in concert) may allow for almost unlimited channels and/or stations as compared to traditional radio where only a narrow band of electromagnetic radiation has been appropriated for use among a small number of entities by government regulators
(e.g. the FCC).
<br/><br/> The user 2916 may be an individual who operates the data processing system 4204 (e.g., a data processing system 504) to generate the broadcast data 4202.  It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the verified nature of the user may
be an optional characteristic in an alternate embodiment.  This means that in an alternate embodiment, any user (whether verified or not) may generate the broadcast data 4202 through the data processing system 4204.  In another alternative embodiment,
the user 2916 may be an electronic sensor, such as a detection sensor device (e.g., a sensory detection sensor device such as a motion detector, a chemical detection device, etc.), and/or an appliance (e.g., such as a refrigerator, a home security
network, and/or a motion detector).  It should also be noted that the `mobile` nature of the data processing system 4204 may be optional in yet another alternative embodiment.  In such an alternate embodiment, any computing device, whether
mobile/portable or fixed in location may generate the broadcast data 4202.
<br/><br/> The cellular network 2908 may be associated with a telephone carrier (e.g., such as AT&amp;T, Sprint, etc.) that provides an infrastructure through which communications are generated between the commerce server 4200 and the service providers 4209
using the radial algorithm 4241.  For example, the cellular network 2908 may provide a communication infrastructure through which the broadcast data 4202 may be communicated as voice and/or text messages through telephones (e.g., standard telephones
and/or smart phones) operated by at least some of the service providers 4209 of FIG. 42.  It should be understood that in one embodiment, the service providers 4209 are paid subscribers/customers of the geospatially constrained social network 4242 in a
manner such that each of the service providers 4209 may pay a fee per received broadcast data 4202, and/or each hired engagement to the geospatially constrained social network 4242.  The service providers 4209 may pay extra to be permitted access to
receive the broadcast data 4202 even when they do not have a transitory and/or non-transitory connection to a neighborhood if they service that neighborhood area though operating their business outside of it.  For this reason, FIG. 42 visually
illustrates that the service providers 4209 may be located (e.g., principal business address) outside the threshold radial distance 4219.
<br/><br/> The cellular network 2908 (e.g., a mobile network) may be a wireless network distributed over land areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver, known as a cell site or base station through which the broadcast data
4202 is distributed from the commerce server 4200 to telephones of the service providers 4209 using the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert), according to one
embodiment.  The cellular network 2908 may use a set of frequencies from neighboring cells, to avoid interference and provide guaranteed bandwidth within each cell, in one embodiment.
<br/><br/> When joined together these cells of the cellular network 2908 may provide radio coverage over a wide geographic area through the cellular network 2908 in a manner that ensures that the broadcast data 4202 may be simultaneously communicated via
both IP networks (e.g., to the recipients 4214) and/or to the service providers 4209 through the cellular network 2908.  It will be appreciated that the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of
modules working in concert) in effect permits simultaneous updates to claimed user pages, unclaimed (preseeded) user pages in a geospatially constrained social network 4242 (e.g., neighborhood social network) based on a geospatial location of the data
processing system 4204 in a manner that simulates a radio (RF) based network separately from the concepts described in conjunction with the cellular network 2908.  However, it will be understood that the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that
applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a series of modules working in concert) may be not restricted to such topology and can multimodally communicate through different networks, such as through the cellular network 2908 described in FIG. 42.
<br/><br/> The service providers 4209 may be locations, devices, and/or mobile phones associated with individuals and/or agencies.  The service providers 4209 may be notified when a garage sale in a local area including a non-transitory location (e.g.,
around where they live and/or work, regardless of where they currently are) and a transitory location (e.g., where they currently are) is posted using the data processing system 4204 as the broadcast data 4202.
<br/><br/> The service providers 4209 may include the businesses 2922, emergency services (e.g., police, firefighters, and/or medical first responders), food related establishments, retail establishments, and/or repair services).  In this manner, data
processing systems 4304 and/or desktop computers operated by the service providers 4209 may be alerted whenever the broadcast data 4202 is posted in and/or around their neighborhood through a push notification (e.g., an alert popping up on their phone),
through an email, a telephone call, and/or a voice message delivered to the particular data processing system operated by each of the service providers 4209 using the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241 using a
series of modules working in concert).
<br/><br/> The broadcast data 4202 may be delivered as notification data 4212 from the commerce server 4200 to the recipients 4214 and/or to the service providers 4209 using the radial distribution module 4240 (e.g., that applies the radial algorithm 4241
using a series of modules working in concert) of the commerce server 4200.
<br/><br/> The recipients 4214 may be individuals that have claimed a profile (e.g., verified their profile through a postcard, a telephone lookup, a utility bill) associated with a particular non-transitory address (e.g., a home address, a work address)
through a geospatial social network (e.g., a geospatially constrained social network 4242 (e.g., a neighborhood social network such as Fatdoor.com, Nextdoor.com)) through which the commerce server 4200 operates.  The recipients 4214 may be in a
geo-fenced area, in that an epicenter 4244 of a broadcast message from the data processing system 4204 (e.g., a data processing system 504) may be a center through which a radial distance is calculated based on a characteristic of the broadcast data
4202.  For example, a short term job (e.g., moving furniture) may be delivered only to an immediate 0.1 mile radius, and a permanent job opening may be automatically delivered to a broader 0.6 mile radius either automatically and/or through a user
defined preference (e.g., set by the user 2916).
<br/><br/> It should be appreciated that individuals in an area outside the threshold radial distance 4219 may not receive the broadcast data 4202 because their geospatial address may be outside a radial boundary surrounding an epicenter 4244 in which the
broadcast data 4202 originates.  Additionally, the threshold radial distance 4219 may be confined on its edges by a geospatial polygon at a juncture between area defined by recipients 4214 and the area outside the threshold radial distance 4219,
according to one embodiment.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may periodically transmit the heartbeat message 4260 to the commerce server 4200.  The heartbeat message may include the current geo-spatial coordinates of the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 4262, a time stamp 4264, a date stamp 4266, and/or an operational status of the vehicle 4268.
<br/><br/> FIG. 43A shows a form 4302 of an autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300, according to one embodiment.  The autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 may be comprised of the same systems or similar systems as illustrated in FIG. 1A and FIG. 2.  The
autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 may have the same capabilities as the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle may have a detachable storage compartment 4301 physically associated with it.  The
storage compartment 101 may be detachable from the autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 and/or may be the same as or similar to the storage compartment discussed in FIG. 1A.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 may have a maximum
speed similar to that of electric bicycles known in the art.  The autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 may be able to travel in the bike lane 304.
<br/><br/> The autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 may have a balancing system that enables the autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 to remain upright when stationary and/or to compensate for unequal distribution of weight of the storage compartment 101. 
In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 may have a suspension system and/or wheels that enables the autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 to traverse any terrain (e.g., snow, grass, mud, rocks, sidewalk curbs, and/or potholes) without
disturbing and/or damaging the contents of the storage compartment 101.  In one embodiment, the pedals may not be part of the autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300.
<br/><br/> FIG. 43B shows the autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 of FIG. 43A, according to one embodiment.  The autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 may be capable of being collapsed (e.g., compacted and/or folded).  This collapsing may enable the
autonomous neighborhood bicycle to be more efficiently stored and/or transported.  The storage compartment 101 may be detached.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 may be capable of being collapsed without detaching the storage
compartment 101, as shown in FIG. 43B.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 may be portable (e.g., able to fit in the trunk of a car) when collapsed and/or not collapsed.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 may be able to be deployed (e.g., given an assignment (e.g., a pick-up and/or delivery) and/or able to execute the assignment) remotely when stored in the trunk of an autonomous
vehicle.  For example, an individual may have an autonomous car and an autonomous neighborhood vehicle 4300.  The individual may store their autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 in the trunk of their autonomous car.  The individual may be out to dinner
and realize they left their wallet at home.  Rather than having their significant other drive all the way to the restaurant to deliver the wallet or risk losing their parking spot and having to leave the dinner, the individual may be able to send an
order to their autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 through their mobile device (either communicating directly to the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 4300 and/or the autonomous car) to retrieve their wallet from their house.
<br/><br/> The autonomous car may open its trunk and the autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300 may be able to situate itself (e.g., unfold and/or configure itself into an operational condition) complete the pick-up, delivering the wallet to the restaurant,
re-collapse itself, and return to the trunk of the autonomous car.  Rather than missing the dinner or burdening another individual, the individual may be able to retrieve their wallet by simply walking outside the restaurant and removing their wallet
from the storage compartment.
<br/><br/> FIG. 44 is a cross sectional view 4450 of a storage compartment 4400 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, according to one embodiment.  The storage compartment 4400 may have separate compartments 4401 capable of keeping their contents
separate from other compartments 4401 and/or other items 4502 in the same compartment 4401.  The compartment(s) 4401 may have a suspension system capable of keeping the contents of the compartment(s) 4401 stable and/or protected.  In one embodiment, the
compartments 4401 may be able to be kept at different temperatures and/or humidity levels via the temperature control module 246.  In one embodiment, the compartments 4401 may be separated by barriers 4403 capable of absorbing, deflecting, canceling etc.
temperatures and able to keep humidity levels and temperatures separate between compartments 4401.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and/or the storage compartment 4400 may have a loading mechanism 4402 capable of loading items 4502 from any number and/or combination of compartments 4401 to the ejection module 110. 
An air based propulsion system 4406 may work in concert with the camera adjacent to the ejection module 4408 to eject the object from the ejection module 110 to a targeted destination.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and/or
the storage compartment 4400 may possess multiple ejection modules 110, air based propulsion systems 4406 and/or cameras adjacent to the ejection module 4408.  The user (e.g., recipient 4214) may be able to make a payment via a biometric payment reader
4410 on the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.
<br/><br/> FIG. 45 is a cross sectional view 4550 of a storage compartment 4500 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, according to one embodiment.  Particularly, FIG. 45 shows the storage compartment 4500, an item 4502, and warming trays 4504.  In
one embodiment, the storage compartment 4500 may have several trays capable of storing items 4502 on separate levels.  The trays may be warming trays 4504 capable of warming items (e.g., pizza boxes) placed on the tray and/or cooling trays capable of
cooling items 4502 placed on the tray (not shown).  A suspension device 4506 may keep the item 4502 stable in transit and/or may absorb shocks and/or correct for forces acting on the interior of the storage compartment 101.  The recipient 4214 may be
able to pay using a magnetic card reader 4508 on the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.
<br/><br/> FIG. 46A is a sidewalk traversing view 4650 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle using the telescoping platform to mount a sidewalk, according to one embodiment.  The sidewalk detection sensor 111 may detect that a sidewalk is present (e.g.,
blocking the path of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100) by sensing a gradation rise 4600 of a sidewalk start location 4602.  The telescoping platform 107 may elevate the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 from the roadway 114 so that the wheels
are level with the surface of the sidewalk 112.  The telescoping platform may shift the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 in such a way that the wheels meet the sidewalk 112 surface.
<br/><br/> Once the rest of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 is securely on the surface of the sidewalk 112, the telescoping platform 107 may return (e.g., re-ascend and/or collapse) itself to its original position and/or orientation (e.g., at the
base of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 4601 now located on the sidewalk 112).  In one embodiment, the telescoping platform may be capable of rotating 360 degrees around a vertical axis, allowing the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to mount the
sidewalk 112 at a 90 degree angle from where it was facing on the roadway 114.  It will be appreciated by one with skill in the art that other methods for raising and/or lowering the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 so as to traverse a gradation
change are possible.
<br/><br/> FIG. 46B is a sidewalk traversing view 4651 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle using the telescoping platform to dismount a sidewalk, according to one embodiment.  The sidewalk detection sensor 111 may detect that a sidewalk is ending by
sensing a gradation drop 4604 of a sidewalk end location 4606.  In one embodiment, the telescoping platform 107 may first lower a set of front wheels 4608 to the roadway 114.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may move itself forward off the
sidewalk 112 with its set of front wheels 4608 on the roadway 114 and its rear wheels on the sidewalk 112.  Once the rear wheels reach the sidewalk end location 4606, the rear wheels may seamlessly be lowered to the roadway in a manner such that the
contents of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 are not disturbed by the change in elevation.  Other methods for raising and/or lowering the autonomous neighborhood vehicle to traverse gradation changes are possible.  FIG. 46B also shows a pattern
4608 of the wheels allowing the autonomous neighborhood vehicle to traverse obstacles and/or different terrains.  A remote sensing capability 4612 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 47-51 illustrate collision identification view 4750, 4850, 4950, 5050, and 5150 of exemplary steps for rapidly identifying the location of the potential collision.  FIG. 47 illustrates the trajectory path 4700 (e.g., the optimal route 802)
of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and the trajectory path 4702 of another entity (e.g., a car, another autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, a bicycle, an animal).  The trajectory path 4700 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 is viewed as
a plurality of line segments with each line segment constructed between positions of time.
<br/><br/> For example, a first line segment is represented by a line constructed between t.sub.h(0) and t.sub.h(1), a second line segment is represented by a line constructed between t.sub.h (1) and t.sub.h(2), and so forth.  The trajectory path of
another entity is also viewed as line segments constructed between time positions.  For example, a first line segment is represented by a line constructed between t.sub.r(0) and t.sub.r(1), a second line segment is represented by a line constructed
between t.sub.r(1) and t.sub.r(2), and so forth.  The location of the potential intersection of the trajectory path 4700 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and the trajectory path 4702 of the another entity is at a location where the line segment
of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 represented by t.sub.h(n-1) and t.sub.h(n), hereinafter referred to as line segment 4704, intersects with line segment of the another, entity represented by t.sub.r (n-1) and t.sub.r(n) t.sub.h(n), hereinafter
referred to as line segment 4706.  A determination of where the intersection is located can be computationally extensive if all line segments of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and the line segments of the another entity required intersecting
analysis.  That is, a comprehensive analysis would require that the first line segment of the trajectory path 4700 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and the first line segment of the trajectory path 4702 of the another entity are analyzed to
determine if an intersection is present.
<br/><br/> If no intersection exists, then the first line segment of the trajectory path 4700 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 is sequentially checked for an intersection with all the remaining line segments of the trajectory path 4702 of the
another entity.  If no intersection is detected, then a second line segment of the trajectory path would be sequentially analyzed for an intersection with all the line segments of the trajectory path 4702 of another entity.  Each remaining line segment
of the trajectory path 4700 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 would be sequentially analyzed with the each line segment of the trajectory path 4702 of the another entity until an intersection is detected.  Depending on the number of line
segments, such an assessment could be time consuming and computationally extensive.
<br/><br/> The advantage of the embodiments described herein provides for a rapid assessment for determining the intersection of the two trajectory paths.  As illustrated in FIG. 47, a boundary box 4708 is constructed around the trajectory path boundary
4710, and a boundary box 4712 is constructed around the trajectory path boundary 4714.  Boundary boxes 4708 and 4712, in the shape of rectangles, form envelopes (separate from the envelope 900) around the entire trajectory path boundary of each vehicle
and/or entity.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 48, midway position index locations of each boundary box 4708 and 4712 are identified as represented by position indexes 4800 and 4802, respectively.  It should be understood that the midway of the index locations that contain the
boundary box is used to divide the boundary box into portions, which may not be the midway point of the boundary box itself.  Therefore, the subdivided boundary boxes may not be equal halves.  Position indexes containing the boundary box 4708 and 4712
are each subdivided into two portions at the position indexes 4800 and 4802.  The subdivided boundary boxes of each respective trajectory path that contain the intersecting line segments 4704 and 4706 are selected as represented by 4804 and 4806.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 49, subdivided boundary boxes 4804 and 4806 are regenerated.  The boundary boxes may be regenerated by either the length and/or width based on the trajectory path of each entity (e.g., the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and/or the
another entity).  The regenerated boxes are not required to align to a same axis the previous boundary boxes were positioned.  Rather, the routine allows each boundary box to be configured to the targeted portion of the trajectory path that the routine
is analyzing.  As a result, the boundary box can be repositioned to accommodate to varying change of directions along the trajectory path.  For each regeneration, the boundary boxes are configured adapt to the trajectory paths at the location of the
collision.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 50, the midway position index locations of each regenerated boundary box 4804 and 4806 are identified.  Boundary boxes 4804 and 4806 are further subdivided into portions using the position indexes 4900 and 4902.  The intersection of the
subdivided portions is determined and a next set of intersecting boundary boxes are regenerated.  The next set of regenerated boundary boxes includes the intersection of the trajectory paths.  The routine repeatedly subdivides and regenerates the
boundary boxes until only the respective intersecting line segments 4704 and 4706 are contained within the final boundary boxes.  It should be understood that the subdividing of the boundary boxes may require more or less subdividing than what is shown. 
The subdividing of the boundary box ends when a respective remaining boundary box contains only two of the position index locations.  The two positions will form line segment.
<br/><br/> FIG. 51 illustrates a final set of regenerated boundary boxes 5100 and 5102 where the line segments 4704 and 4706 intersect within their respective margins.  As is shown, the only line segments that are disposed within each respective boundary
box are their respective line segments.  It should be understood that the technique described can used a set of index positions for identifying the intersection as opposed to the line segments.  For example, it is determined that the intersection occurs
between t.sub.h(n-1) and t.sub.h(n) for the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, and that the respective boundary box for the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 could be subdivided and regenerated based on the boundary box containing the set of point
indexes t.sub.h(n-1) and t.sub.h(n) in contrast to a line segment.
<br/><br/> FIG. 52 is an intersection view of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 functioning at an intersection, according to one embodiment.  As the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 approaches an intersection, it may use its various components
(e.g., sensor system 102) to detect the vehicle's location as well as objects external to the vehicle.  For example, autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may use data from the geographic position component (e.g., the global positioning system 218) to
identify location coordinates or an address associated with the current location of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may then access road-graph data corresponding to this location.
<br/><br/> The autonomous neighborhood vehicle's 100 computer system 200 may use data from the sensor system 102 to detect objects in the autonomous neighborhood vehicle's 100 surroundings (e.g., the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152). As the sensor (e.g., laser, camera 226, ultrasound unit 228) moves along, it may collect range (distance) and intensity information for the same location (point or area) from several directions and/or at different times.  FIG. 52 depicts an exemplary
display of sensor data collected as the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 approaches an intersection 5200.  For example, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may be able to detect lane lines, a crosswalk 5202, traffic signs and/or lights etc. as
well as their locations relative to the current location of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  This relative location information may be used to identify an actual location of the object.  In some examples, the computer system 200, sensor fusion
algorithm 238 and/or sensor system 102 may use the road-graph and data from the sensor system 102 to increase the accuracy of the current location of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, for example by comparing lane lines of intersection 5200 to
lane lines of the road-graph, etc. In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may be able to navigate autonomously without use of and/or need for lane lines.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may stop at a
minimum crosswalk proximity 5304.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle may identify (e.g., sense and/or identify) a stop sign 5206, a yield sign 5208 and/or a traffic light) and proceed appropriately.
<br/><br/> In addition to detecting fixed objects, the computer system 200, sensor fusion algorithm 238 and/or sensor system 102 may also detect the existence and geographic location of moving objects (e.g., the bicyclist 302, the car 310, the pedestrian
804 and/or an animal).  The computer system 200, sensor fusion algorithm 238 and/or sensor system 102 may determine whether an object is moving or not based on the autonomous neighborhood vehicle's 100 own speed and acceleration, etc., and the data
received from the sensor.  For example, as shown in FIG. 52, the sensor data may be used to detect objects 610,611, and 620, corresponding to the pedestrians and bicyclist of FIG. 48, as well as their locations relative to the current location of the
vehicle.  This relative location information may be used to identify an actual location of the object.  After some short period of time where the bicyclist and pedestrians have moved, computer 110 may determine that these features are moving based on a
change in their location relative to intersection 5200.
<br/><br/> Once the various objects in the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152 have been detected, they may be compared to the road-graph in order to identify what the objects are.  For example, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100
may identify lane lines from the laser data as lane lines of the road-graph.  However, objects (e.g., a bicyclist 302E, a bicyclist 302F, a pedestrian 904C and/or a pedestrian 904D) will not appear on the road-graph as they are not static objects
expected to reappear each time the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 drives through intersection 5200.
<br/><br/> These moving (or non-static) objects may also be compared to the road-graph data for identification.  Objects which are located completely or partly within a pre-defined area of the road-graph may be identified based on the area identifier.  The
geographic locations of the objects may be compared to the corresponding geographic locations in the road-graph.  Objects may be identified by the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 as pedestrians based on their location (e.g., in the crosswalk 5202). 
Similarly, bicyclists 302E and 302F appear within bike lane 304, and the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may identify the objects as a bicyclists based on their location in the bicycle lane 304 identifier, shape and/or speed.
<br/><br/> Not every object observed in the pre-defined areas will necessarily be a pedestrian (or bicyclist).  For example, other vehicles (e.g. scooters, cars, trucks) may also pass through crosswalks or move into bicycle lanes.  In this regard, the
identifier associated with a pre-defined area may be a hint or indication that objects in these areas may be more likely to be pedestrians or bicyclists.  For example, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle's 100 computer system 200 and/or sensor fusion
algorithm 238 may consider a variety of sensor data and map data which may indicate a moving object's type.  These indications may include laser point cloud density, surface normal distribution, object height, object radius, camera image color, object
shape, object moving speed, object motion in the past N seconds, etc. The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may then consider the object's type based on the sum of these indications, for example, by using a machine learning algorithm which classifies
the type of object.  In one example, the machine learning algorithm may include various decision trees.  The pre-defined regions may therefore allow the computer to identify certain objects, such as pedestrians and bicyclists, faster.
<br/><br/> If the moving object cannot be identified based on the area identifiers, other identification methods may be used.  For example, image and pattern matching techniques involving comparing one or more images (or laser data) of the moving object to
a set of pre-identified images (or laser data), may be used to identify the moving object.
<br/><br/> Once the moving objects have been identified, the computer system 200 may use this information to control the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100.  The computer system 200 may operate the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 in order to avoid
injury to nearby people or the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 by maintaining a safe minimum distance, for example several yards, from pedestrians or bicyclists while the autonomous neighborhood vehicle is moving.  For example, an autonomous
neighborhood vehicle 100 may stop where the pedestrian 904D is identified in the crosswalk 5250 in front of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, or the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may not pass the bicyclist 302F unless the autonomous
neighborhood vehicle 100 is able to maintain the minimal distance (e.g., in compliance with the envelope 900).  In another example, the type of action may be based on the object detected by the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and/or the conditions in
which the autonomous neighborhood vehicle operates (e.g., the state of the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 152).
<br/><br/> For example, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle may have a larger minimum distance at which it may stop at crosswalks 5202 when it is raining and/or may have a larger minimum distance that must be maintained between the autonomous neighborhood
vehicle 100 and a pedestrian than between the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and a traffic cone.  In one embodiment, before the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may continue along its route (e.g., enter the intersection, make a turn, continue to
move), the pedestrian 904D may have to clear the crosswalk 5202 and/or the roadway 114.  The bicyclist 302E may be required to exit the intersection 5200 before the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may continue along its route.
<br/><br/> FIG. 53 is a user interface view 5350 of the data processing system 4204 showing the autonomous neighborhood vehicle in a neighborhood, according to one embodiment.  The user of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 (e.g., the user 2916, a
renter and/or an owner) may be able to view the location of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 on a neighborhood map on the data processing system 4204.  The user (e.g., the user 2916) may be able to select options on the data processing system
4204.  A stop function may allow the user to remotely stop the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, a go function may allow the user to remotely make the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 move and/or begin a deliver and/or pick-up submitted by the
user.
<br/><br/> The user may be able to change the route taken by the autonomous neighborhood vehicle, the destination and/or return location by selecting a reroute function.  A change details function may allow the user to alter aspects of the task (e.g.,
pick-up and/or delivery).  The user may be able to update a shopping list, alter a desired pick-up and/or drop-off time, alter humidity levels, alter temperature, alter constrains of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle (e.g., the envelope 900 and/or a
maximum speed).  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle may have set constraints that may not be altered and/or have set ranges that allow users to alter constraints within the set ranges.  The user may be able to select a switch views
function that may enable the user to switch between an aerial view (shown in FIG. 53), a street view (e.g., a view through the camera 226), a view through any other sensor and/or a rear view).  A "take off" function may enable the user to signal to the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to begin its task.  A rescue function may contact repair services and/or notify the owner of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle if there is an issue (e.g., breakdown, blown tire, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle
gets stuck).
<br/><br/> The user interface may show an autonomous neighborhood vehicle map 5300 with a current location of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 5406 (shown in FIG. 54), a geospatial vicinity 5302, a neighborhood boundary 5303, the neighbor 2902, a
destination 5306, and/or other autonomous neighborhood vehicles 100.  In one embodiment the user may be able to view the profile of the neighbor 2902 and/or create bi-directional communication with the neighbor 2902 (e.g., request to use their autonomous
neighborhood vehicle 100) by selecting the neighbor's icon on the map of the neighborhood 1402A (e.g., the autonomous neighborhood vehicle map 5300.  The user may be able to view a starting address 5308 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, a
destination address 5312, and/or a merchant 5310 and/or destination 5306.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the user (e.g., user 2916) may be able to record a video and/or audio (e.g., using the sensor system 102 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100), take pictures, alter the speed, alter the temperature of the storage
compartment 101 (e.g., using the temperature control module 246), and/or order the autonomous neighborhood vehicle to return (e.g., to the start location (e.g., start address 5308) or the user location 5408).  The user may be able to view the amount of
energy of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 that remains.  In one embodiment, the user may be able to view a radius (e.g., maximum distance) the autonomous neighborhood vehicle is able to travel.  In one embodiment, the user may be able to view a
time to arrival 5412 (shown in FIG. 54).  Altering the speed may include increasing and/or decreasing the speed 5307.  In one embodiment, a range of speed 5721 may be a minimum and/or a maximum speed at which the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may
travel.  A predetermined interval 5374 may be set automatically or by the user for when the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 determines is a different route that is more efficient than the optimal route exists.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100
may calculate the route and travel along the route once it is determined to exist.
<br/><br/> FIG. 54 is an autonomous neighborhood vehicle user interface view 5450 of a data processing system 4204 receiving an autonomous neighborhood vehicle alert, according to one embodiment.  Particularly, FIG. 49 shows an autonomous neighborhood
vehicle alert 1302, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle map 5300, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle's current location 5406, a user location 5408, a delivery details 5410, the recipient 4214, a time to arrival view 5412, an action selector 5414, action
5416A, action 5416B, action 5416C, a non-transient location 5418, a credit payment 5420, a particular user 5422, a delivery time 5412, a minimum travel distance 5426, a minimum travel distance per trip 5428, minimum travel distance per day 5432, and
minimum travel distance per delivery 5439.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the user 2916 (e.g., owner of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle, user of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle) may be able to receive autonomous neighborhood vehicle alerts 5402 on the data processing system 4204 associated
with the user 2916.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle alert 5402 may alert the user 2916 when the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 arrives at the destination 5306, departs from the destination 5306, when items 4502 (shown in FIG. 45) have been
removed and/or added, when stuck (e.g., at a traffic light, in traffic, in a ditch), when a breakdown occurs, when a certain amount of time has elapsed, when a threshold distance traveled has elapsed, when energy levels reach a threshold level, when
another user requests to use (e.g., rent) the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, when the lock 1218 has been tampered with, when there is an attempted theft etc.
<br/><br/> The user 2916 (e.g., the owner of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle) may be able to view the autonomous neighborhood vehicle map 5300 via the dat processing system 4204.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle map 5404 may
display the current autonomous neighborhood vehicle location 5406 and/or the user location 5408 (e.g., the user's current location and/or the claimed geospatial location 700).  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle map 5300 may also display the destination
5306, according to one embodiment.  In another embodiment, other users of the geospatially constrained social network 4242 may be able to view the current location of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 5406 and/or may be able to request use of the
autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 if the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 (e.g., autonomous neighborhood bicycle 4300) is within a threshold radial distance 4219 from the location of the other users (e.g., current location and/or claimed
location(s)).
<br/><br/> The delivery details 5410 may allow the user to view confirmation that a task (e.g., a delivery and/or a pick-up) has been completed, that the item 4502 (shown in FIG. 45) has been placed in the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, to indicate a
status of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 etc. In one embodiment, a financial transaction may be completed through the commerce server 4200.  The user 2916 (e.g., owner of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle and/or sender of the items delivered
by the autonomous neighborhood vehicle) may be able to see account information and/or the profile of the recipient 4214 and/or alter their own account information via the data processing system 4204.  The other user (e.g., the recipient of the delivery)
may be able to submit comments to the user 2916 (e.g., information about the delivery, a thank you, a request for further deliveries, a request for use of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle etc.).
<br/><br/> The time to arrival view 5412 may indicate the time (e.g., time remaining, estimated time of arrival) until the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 arrives at its destination 5306 and/or returns from its destination 5306.  The action selector
5414 may allow the user to select an action in response to the autonomous neighborhood vehicle alert 5402.  In one embodiment, the user may select any number of actions (e.g., action 5416A and/or action 5416B and/or action 5416C).  Action 5416A may
enable the user to contact the destination (e.g., the individual, the shop, the company) and/or establish bi-directional communication.  Action 5416B may allow the user to contact repair services (e.g., in the case of a break down).  Action 5416C may
allow the user to command the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 to return to the user's location (e.g., the owner's current location and/or the owner's claimed geospatial location(s), the user's (e.g., renter's) current location).  In one embodiment,
the user may be able to allow other users to user (e.g., rent) the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 via the action selector 5414, change a destination, and/or add additional destinations to the route.
<br/><br/> FIG. 55 is a three dimensional environmental view 5500 of the laser rangefinder/LIDAR unit of the sensor system creating a map of the environment of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle, according to one embodiment.  The laser rangefinder/LIDAR
unit 224 of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle's 100 sensor system 102 may use multiple lasers to map its surroundings, measuring a time-to-distance correlation of each laser in a series to capture the distance data from each point.  The multiple lasers
may be emitted in such a way that a 360 degree scan may be gathered.  This may allow the autonomous neighborhood vehicle to gather very large amounts of data in a short amount of time, creating detailed scans of its surroundings.
<br/><br/> In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 55, the sensor system 102 autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 detects multiple objects in its environment.  The autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may, using the sensor fusion algorithm 238, be able to
identify an object 408A as a pedestrian based on its shape, speed and/or location (e.g., on the sidewalk).  An object 408B may be identified as a car based on similar criteria.  In one embodiment, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 may have multiple
laser rangefinder/LIDAR units 224 so that a 360 degree scan can be achieved.  In one embodiment, the three dimensional environmental view 5500 may be captured and/or created by multiple sensors working in concert.
<br/><br/> FIG. 56 is a garage view 5650 of a garage structure 5600 contacting two passenger vehicles 5604 (autonomous cars), an operator of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 5602, and an autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100, according to one embodiment. 
Individuals may be able to purchase the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and/or store it in their garage.  Families may have multiple autonomous cars for personnel transportation along with the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 for running errands. 
In the shown embodiment of FIG. 56, the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 has an internal sensor system (e.g., no sensors mounted on top of or on the surface of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle).  The autonomous cars are shown with one having a top
mounted sensor system 102 (e.g., a LIDAR sensor) and one having an internal sensor system (e.g., a non-surface mounted sensor system).
<br/><br/> FIG. 57 is an emergency broadcast view of the data processing system of FIG. 42 receiving an emergency broadcast message, according to one embodiment.  Particularly, FIG. 57 shows an emergency broadcast message 5702, a failure condition 5703, an
impact 5704, an accident 5705, a mechanical failure 5706, a crime 5707, an electrical failure 5708, an attempted tampering 5709, a video data 5710, a fire station 5711, an audio data 5712, a police station 5713, a photo data 5714, a medical responder
5715, a time out 5716, a damage condition 5718, a geo-spatial coordinates data 5720, a longitudinal data 5722, a latitudinal data 5724, an event 5726, an occurrence 5728, an online community 5730, a map 5734, a geospatial representation of a set of
points 5736, a member data 5738, an address 5740, a profile 5742, a personal address privacy preference 5744, a verification 5746, and a particular residential address 5748.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the emergency broadcast message 5702 may be sent to the data processing system 4204 of a recipient 4214 having a verified address in a threshold distance from the event (e.g., the occurrence 5728 of the failure condition
5703).  In one embodiment, the emergency broadcast message 5702 may be sent to a service provider 4209 (e.g., the fire station 5711, the police station 5713, and/or the medical responder 5715).  The recipient 4214 of the emergency broadcast message 5702
may be able to respond to the message, see the location of the event 5726 on the map 5734 (e.g., the current location of the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 5406), view video data 5710, audio data 5712, photo data 5714 and/or the geo-spatial coordinates
data 5720.  In one embodiment, the user (e.g., the recipient 4214) may be able to view and/or alter their profile and/or information (e.g., address 5740 and/or personal address privacy preference 5744) on the data processing system 4204.
<br/><br/> People in suburbia and urban cities now may not even know who their neighbors are.  Communities have become more insular.  There may be a few active people in each neighborhood who know about their neighborhood and are willing to share what they
know with others.  They should be able to share this information with others through the Internet.  Many people want to know who their neighbors are and express themselves and their families through the internet.  People want to also know about
recommendations and what kind of civic and cultural things are in the neighborhood.  What is contemplated includes: A social network for people who want to get to know their neighbors and/or neighborhoods.  Particularly, one in which a set of maps of
neighborhoods (e.g., such as those on Zillow.com or provided through Google.RTM.  or Microsoft.RTM.) are used as a basis on which a user can identify themselves with a particular address.  This address may be verified through one or more of the modules
on FIG. 29.  Particularly, this address may be the current address of the user is living, a previous address where the user used to live, etc.
<br/><br/> The address may be verified through a credit check of the user, or a copy of the user's drivers license.  Once the user is approved in a particular home/location, the user can leave their comments about their home.  They can mark their home
information proprietary, so that no one else can contribute to their info without their permission.  They can have separate private and public sections, in which the private section is shared with only verified addresses of neighbors, and the public
section is shared with anybody viewing their profile.  The user can then create separate social networking pages for homes, churches, locations, etc. surrounding his verified address.  As such, the user can express him/herself through their profile, and
contribute information about what they're neighborhood is like and who lives there.  Only verified individuals or entities might be able to view information in that neighborhood.
<br/><br/> The more information the user contributes, the higher his or her status will be in the neighborhood through a marker (e.g., a number of stars), or through additional services offered to the neighbor, such as the ability to search a profiles of
neighbors in a larger distance range from a verified address of the user.  For example, initially, the user may only be able to search profiles within 1 mile on their principal, current home after being verified as living in there.  When they create a
profiles for themselves and/or contribute profiles of other people, they may widen their net of private profiles they may be allowed to search (e.g., because they become a trusted party in the neighborhood by offering civic information).  Neighbors can
leave feedback for each other, and arrange private block parties, etc. through their private profile.  All these features may possible through one or more of the embodiments and/or modules illustrated in FIGS. 1A-57.  Through their public profile,
neighbors can know if there is a doctor living down the street, or an attorney around the corner.  The FIGS. 1A-57 illustrate various embodiments that may be realized.  While a description is given here, a self-evident description can be derived for the
software and various methods, software, and hardware directly from the attached Figures.
<br/><br/> A neighborhood expression and user contribution system is disclosed.  In one aspect, the technology allows users to see the value of millions of homes across the United States and/or the world, not just those that the user themselves own or live
in, because they can share information about their neighbors.  People living in apartments or condos can use the apartment/condo modeler wizard (e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 29) to create models (e.g. 2 or 3d) of their building and share information
about their apartment/home and of their neighbors with others.  The technology has an integrated targeted advertising system for enabling advertisers to make money through the social community module 2900 by delivering targeted and non-targeted
advertisements.
<br/><br/> Aside from giving user generated content of information of homes, the system may also provide value estimates of homes it may also offers several unique features including value changes of each home in a given time frame (e.g. 1, 5, or 10 years)
and aerial views of homes as well as the price of the surrounding homes in the area.  It may also provides basic data of a given home such as square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.  Users may can also obtain current estimates of homes
if there was a significant change made such as recently modeled kitchen.
<br/><br/> In the example systems and methods illustrated in FIGS. 1A-57, neighbors may get to know each other and their surrounding businesses more easily through the Internet.  The user interface view of the social community module may include a
searchable map interface and/or a social networking page on the right when one clicks a particular home/location.  The map interface may/may not include information about prices of a home, or information about the number of bedrooms of a home, etc. In
essence, certain critical input information may be divided as follows:
<br/><br/> Residential location: (1) name of the persons/family living in that residence (2) Their profession if any 3) Their educational background if any (4) Their recreational interests (5) About their family description box (6) Anything else people
want to post about that person including their interests, hobbies, etc. (7) An ability for users to leave endorsements.
<br/><br/> Business location or civic location (e.g., park, govt.  building, church, etc.): (1) name of the business/location (2) email of the manager of the business/location (3) phone number of the business/location if known (4) anything else people want
to say about the business (good or bad), for example, contributable through a claimable.
<br/><br/> These two will be the primary types.  Various features differentiate example embodiments of the social community module from other social networks.  These differentiators include (1) interface driven by address (2) maps that can be viewed,
zoomed in on, tied to a parcel #, etc. (3) Anyone can populate anyone's social network page.  (4) Anybody can post in one of the boxes.  They can post anonymously or publicly (5) If someone wants to override information that already has been established,
they will need to have an identity (e.g., user name), to override published posting information.
<br/><br/> However, according to one embodiment, if an owner of an entity location wishes to mark their location private, and uneditable by the public without their permission, they will need to pay (e.g., a monthly fixed fee) through the social community
module.  Alternatively, the owner of the entity location may not need to pay to mark the location as private and uneditable by the public without the owner's permission.  Example embodiments of the social community module may feature info about
businesses.  They may also feature info about people that live in the homes, and may/may not display information on prices, number of bedrooms, etc.
<br/><br/> The social community module (e.g., as described in FIG. 29) may be a search engine (e.g., Google.RTM., Yahoo.RTM., etc.) that uses maps (e.g., satellite map views) instead of text displays to show information, user profiles, reviews, promotions,
ads, directions, events, etc. relevant to user searches.
<br/><br/> The example systems and methods illustrated in FIGS. 1A-57 may facilitate a social network membership that spreads virally by users inviting their friends.  For example, every person that registers has their own profile, but registration may not
be required to contribute content.  However, registration may be required to "own" content on your own home, and have override permission to delete things that you don't like about yourself listed about you by others.  In one embodiment, the social
community module may need to confirm the user's identity and address (e.g., using digital signature tools, drivers license verification, etc.), and/or the user may need to pay a monthly fixed fee (e.g., through a credit card) to control their identity.
<br/><br/> For example, they can get a rebate, and not have to pay the monthly fee for a particular month, if they invite at least 15 people that month AND contribute information about at least 10 of their neighbors, friends, civic, or business locations
in their neighborhood.  People can post pics of their family, their business, their home, etc. on their profile once they `own` their home and register.  In another embodiment, endorsements for neighbors by others will be published automatically.  People
can search for other people by descriptors (e.g., name, profession, distance away from me, etc.)
<br/><br/> Profiles of users may be created and/or generated on the fly, e.g., when one clicks on a home.
<br/><br/> People may be able to visually see directions to their neighborhood businesses, rather than reading directions through text in a first phase.  After time, directions (e.g., routes) can be offered as well.  Users can leave their opinions on
businesses, but the social community module also enables users to leave opinions on neighbors, occupants or any entity having a profile on the map display.  The social community module may not attempt to restrict freedom of speech by the users, but may
voluntarily delete slanderous, libelous information on the request of an owner manually at any time.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the methods and systems illustrated in FIGS. 1A-57 enable people to search for things they want e.g. nearby pizzas etc. (e.g., by distance away).  Advertisers can `own` their listing by placing a display ad on nextdoor.com. 
Instead of click-through revenues when someone leaves the site, revenues will be realized when the link is clicked and someone views a preview html on the right of the visual map.  Targeted advertisements may also be placed when someone searches a
particular street, name, city, etc.
<br/><br/> In another example embodiment, the social community module may enable users of the social network to populate profiles for apartments, buildings, condos, etc. People can create floors, layout, etc. of their building, and add social network pages
on the fly when they click on a location that has multiple residents, tenants, or lessees.
<br/><br/> A user interface associated with the social community module 2900 may be clean, simple, and uncluttered (e.g., Simple message of "get to know your neighbors").  For example, the map interface shows neighbors.  Methods and systems associated with
the features described may focus on user experience, e.g., ensuring a compelling message to invite friends and/or others to join.  A seed phase for implementation of the methods and systems illustrated in FIGS. 1A-57 may be identified for building a
membership associated with the social community module.
<br/><br/> For example, a user having extensive networks in a certain area (e.g., a city) may seed those communities as well.  The social network may encourage user expression, user content creation, ease of use on site to get maximum users/distribution as
quickly as possible.  In another embodiment, the social community module may ensure that infrastructure associated with operation of the social community module (e.g., servers) are able to handle load (e.g., data traffic) and keep up with expected
growth.
<br/><br/> For example, the user interface view illustrated in the various figures shows an example embodiment of the social community module of FIG. 29.  The user interface view may include a publicly editable profile wall section allowing public postings
that owners of the profile can edit.  For example, any user may be able to post on an empty profile wall, but a user must claim the location to own the profile (e.g., may minimize barriers to users posting comments on profile walls).
<br/><br/> Names featured on the profile wall may be links to the user profiles on the map (e.g., giving an immediate sense for the location of admirers (or detractors) relative to user location).  In one embodiment, an action (e.g., mouse-over) on a
comment would highlight the comment user's house on the map and names linking to user profiles.  The user interface view may also utilize the mapping interface to link comments to locations.
<br/><br/> For example, the various embodiments illustrate a comment announcing a garage sale, that is tied to a mappable location on the mapping interface.  (e.g., allows people to browse references directly from people's profiles).  In the various
figures, an example display of the mapping interface is illustrated.  In this example display, houses are shown in green, a church is shown in white, the red house shows the selected location and/or the profile owner's house, question marks indicate
locations without profile owners, blue buildings are commercial locations, and the pink building represents an apartment complex.
<br/><br/> Houses with stars indicate people associated with (e.g., "friends") of the current user.  In one embodiment, a user action (e.g., mouse-over) on a commercial property displayed in the mapping interface may pull up a star (e.g., "***) rating
based on user reviews, and/or a link to the profile for the property.  A mouse-over action on the apartment complex may pull up a building schematic for the complex with floor plans, on which the user can see friends/profiles for various floors or rooms. Question marks indicated in the display may prompt users to own that profile or post comments on the wall for that space.  A user action on any house displayed in the mapping interface may pull up a profile link, summary info such as status, profession,
interests, etc. associated with the profile owner, a link to add the person as a friend, and/or a link to send a message to the user (e.g., the profile owner).
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, a default profile view shown is that of the current user (e.g., logged in), and if the user clicks on any other profile, it may show their profile in that space instead (with few text changes to indicate different person). The events in your area view of the profile display in may have a default radius for notification of events (e.g., by street, by block, by neighborhood, county, etc.) Events are associated with user profiles and may link to locations displayed on the
mapping interfaces.  The hot picks section may be an ad/promotional zone, with default settings for radius of alerts also configurable.
<br/><br/> For example, the "Find a Friend" section may permit users to search by name, address, interests, status, profession, favorite movies/music/food etc. Users are also able to search within a given radius of their location.  In one embodiment, the
user interface view may include a link for the user to invite other people to join the network (e.g., may encourage users who see a question-mark on a house or a location on the mapping interface that corresponds to a real location associated with
someone they know to contact that person and encourage them to join and own that profile through the social community module).
<br/><br/> Some of the reasons we believe these embodiments are unique include:
<br/><br/> Search engine that provides a visual map (e.g., rather than text) display of information relevant to user queries.
<br/><br/> Users can search on the map for other people having certain professional, educational, personal, extracurricular, cultural, political and/or family etc. profiles or interests, within any location range.
<br/><br/> Users can search for information on the map, that is accessible directly through profile displays.  For example, the user may search for information about a certain subject and be directed to a profile of another user having information about
the subject.  Alternatively, the user may view the search subject itself as a visible item (e.g., if applicable to the search query) having a profile on the map display, along with additional information associated with the item (e.g., contributed by
other users).
<br/><br/> Allows users to search, browse and view information posted by other users about an entity location such as a home, a business property, a condo, an apartment complex, etc. directly on a map display
<br/><br/> Allows users to browse, form and join groups and communities based on location, preferences, interests, friend requests, etc.
<br/><br/> Users can send messages to other people through their profiles within the map display
<br/><br/> Users can find friends, business associates, vendors, romantic partners, etc. on the map within any location range (e.g., in their neighborhood, street, subdivision, etc.) by browsing the map display or searching for people with certain profile
characteristics and/or similar interests.
<br/><br/> Users can view, browse and post comments/information/reviews about entity locations and/or people associated with those locations (e.g., occupants of a house, families, apartment residents, businesses, non-governmental entities, etc.), even for
locations that do not have a profile owner.  For example, all entity locations visible on the map display may link to a profiles on which any user can post comments.  To own the profile and edit the information posted about an entity location or the
occupant(s), the occupant(s) would have to join the network associated with the social community module and become the owner of the profile.  The profile owner would then become visible in the map display (e.g., entity locations without profile owners
may only be visible as questions marks on the map, having blank profiles but public comment sections).
<br/><br/> Users can share their comments and opinions about locations, preferences and/or interests on their profiles that are visible and searchable on the map display
<br/><br/> Automatically notifies users of events and promotions in an area (e.g., scope of area can be selected by the user), and highlights venues and user profiles on the map.
<br/><br/> Users can post reviews about entity locations (e.g., businesses) such that ratings for entity locations are visible on the map.  Other users can trace the location of the users that posted the comments on the map.
<br/><br/> Users who post comments on other profiles can be traced directly on the map through their comments.  Alternatively, users can choose to submit anonymous postings or comments on other user/entity profiles, and/or may choose not to be traceable on
the map through their comments.
<br/><br/> For entity locations having more than one residency unit (e.g., apartment complexes), people can create and post on profiles for any room/floor of the location (e.g., by entering information on a schematic view of the location that is visible on
the map).
<br/><br/> Users can visually determine routes/directions/orientation to locations that they can browse within the map display.  Additionally, users can generate written driving, walking or public transit directions between points of interest (e.g., from
the user's house to a friend's house) within the map display.
<br/><br/> Users can communicate (e.g., through live chat) directly with other users in the area based on an association determined through their profiles
<br/><br/> Business entity locations can generate targeted ads and promotions within locations on the map display (e.g., virtual billboards).
<br/><br/> The social community module can realize revenue based on ad clickthroughs by users, without the users being directed away from the interface.  For example, when a user clicks on any targeted ad/promotion displayed on the map, the profile of the
entity associated with the ad/promotion may be generated alongside the map display.
<br/><br/> Neighborhood or neighborhood (see spelling differences) is a geographically localized community located within a larger city or suburb.  The residents of a given neighborhood are called neighbors (or neighbors), although this term may also be
used across much larger distances in rural areas.
<br/><br/> Traditionally, a neighborhood is small enough that the neighbors are all able to know each other.  However in practice, neighbors may not know one another very well at all.  Villages aren't divided into neighborhoods, because they are already
small enough that the villagers can all know each other.
<br/><br/> The system however may work in any country and any geography of the world.  In Canada and the United States, neighborhoods are often given official or semi-official status through neighborhood associations, neighborhood watches, or block
watches.  These may regulate such matters as lawn care and fence height, and they may provide such services as block parties, neighborhood parks, and community security.  In some other places the equivalent organization is the parish, though a parish may
have several neighborhoods within it depending on the area.
<br/><br/> In localities where neighborhoods do not have an official status, questions can arise as to where one neighborhood begins and another ends, such as in the city of Philadelphia, Pa.  Many cities may use districts and wards as official divisions
of the city, rather than traditional neighborhood boundaries.
<br/><br/> In the mainland of the People's Republic of China, the term is generally used for the urban administrative unit usually found immediately below the district level, although an intermediate, sub-district level exists in some cities.  They are
also called streets (administrative terminology may vary from city to city).  Neighborhoods encompass 2,000 to 10,000 families.  Within neighborhoods, families are grouped into smaller residential units or quarters of 2900 to 3400 families and supervised
by a residents' committee; these are subdivided into residents' small groups of fifteen to forty families.  In most urban areas of China, neighborhood, community, residential community, residential unit, residential quarter have the same meaning: or or
or , and is the direct sublevel of a subdistrict (), which is the direct sublevel of a district (), which is the direct sublevel of a city ().  (See Political divisions of China.
<br/><br/> The system and methods may be distributed through neighborhood associations.  A neighborhood or neighborhood (see spelling differences) is a geographically localized community located within a larger city or suburb.  The residents of a given
neighborhood are called neighbors (or neighbors), although this term may also be used across much larger distances in rural areas.
<br/><br/> Traditionally, a neighborhood is small enough that the neighbors are all able to know each other.  However in practice, neighbors may not know one another very well at all.  Villages aren't divided into neighborhoods, because they are already
small enough that the villagers can all know each other.  Each of the technologies and concepts disclosed herein may be embodied in software and/or hardware through one or more of the modules/embodiments discussed in FIGS. 1A-57.
<br/><br/> A block party is a large public celebration in which many members of a single neighborhood congregate to observe a positive event of some importance.  Many times, there will be celebration in the form of playing music and dance.  Block parties
gained popularity in the United States during the 1970s.  Block Parties were often held outdoors and power for the DJ's sound system was taken illegally from street lights.  This was famously referenced in the song "South Bronx" by KRS-One with the line:
<br/><br/> "Power from a street light made the place dark.  But yo, they didn't care, they turned it out." It is also interesting to note that many inner city block parties were actually held illegally, as they might be described as loitering.  However,
police turned a blind eye to them, reasoning that if everyone from the neighborhood was gathered in one place there was less chance of crime being committed elsewhere.
<br/><br/> In the suburbs, block parties are commonly held on holidays such as Fourth of July or Labor Day.  Sometimes the occasion may be a theme such a "Welcome to the Neighborhood" for a new family or a recent popular movie.  Often block parties involve
barbecuing, lawn games such as Simon Says and group dancing such as the Electric Slide, the Macarena or line dancing.
<br/><br/> In other usage, a block party has come to mean any informal public celebration.  For example, a block party can be conducted via television even though there is no real block in the observance.  The same is true for the Internet.  The block
party is closely related to the beach party.  The British equivalent is the street party.
<br/><br/> The systems and methods illustrated in FIGS. 1A-57 may have software to emulate a block party or a neighborhood watch.  A neighborhood watch (also called a crime watch or neighborhood crime watch) is a citizens' organization devoted to crime and
vandalism prevention within a neighborhood.  It is not a vigilante organization, since members are expected not to directly intervene in possible criminal activity.  Instead, neighborhood watch members are to stay alert to unusual activity and contact
the authorities.  It builds on the concept of a town watch from Colonial America.
<br/><br/> The current American system of neighborhood watches began developing in the late 1960s as a response to the rape and murder of Kitty Genovese in Queens, N.Y.  People became outraged that three dozen witnesses did nothing to save Genovese or to
apprehend her killer.  Some locals formed groups to watch over their neighborhoods and to look out for any suspicious activity in their areas.  Shortly thereafter, the National Sheriffs' Association began a concerted effort in 1972 to revitalize the
"watch group" effort nationwide.

<br/><br/> The various methods, systems, and apparatuses disclosed herein and illustrated and described using the attached FIGS. 1A-57 can be applied to creating online community organizations of neighborhoods of any form.  During human growth and
maturation, people encounter sets of other individuals and experiences.  Infants encounter first, their immediate family, then extended family, and then local community (such as school and work).  They thus develop individual and group identity through
associations that connect them to life-long community experiences.
<br/><br/> As people grow, they learn about and form perceptions of social structures.  During this progression, they form personal and cultural values, a world view and attitudes toward the larger society.  Gaining an understanding of group dynamics and
how to "fit in" is part of socialization.  Individuals develop interpersonal relationships and begin to make choices about whom to associate with and under what circumstances.
<br/><br/> During adolescence and adulthood, the individual tends to develop a more sophisticated identity, often taking on a role as a leader or follower in groups.  If associated individuals develop the intent to give of themselves, and commit to the
collective well-being of the group, they begin to acquire a sense of community.
<br/><br/> Socialization: The process of learning to adopt the behavior patterns of the community is called socialization.  The most fertile time of socialization is usually the early stages of life, during which individuals develop the skills and
knowledge and learn the roles necessary to function within their culture and social environment.  For some psychologists, especially those in the psychodynamic tradition, the most important period of socialization is between the ages of 1 and 10.  But
socialization also includes adults moving into a significantly different environment, where they must learn a new set of behaviors.
<br/><br/> Socialization is influenced primarily by the family, through which children first learn community norms.  Other important influences include school, peer groups, mass media, the workplace and government.  The degree to which the norms of a
particular society or community are adopted determines one's willingness to engage with others.  The norms of tolerance, reciprocity and trust are important "habits of the heart," as de Tocqueville put it, in an individual's involvement in community.
<br/><br/> Continuity of the connections between leaders, between leaders and followers, and among followers is vital to the strength of a community.  Members individually hold the collective personality of the whole.  With sustained connections and
continued conversations, participants in communities develop emotional bonds, intellectual pathways, enhanced linguistic abilities, and even a higher capacity for critical thinking and problem-solving.  It could be argued that successive and sustained
contact with other people might help to remove some of the tension of isolation, due to alienation, thus opening creative avenues that would have otherwise remained impassable.
<br/><br/> Conversely, sustained involvement in tight communities may tend to increase tension in some people.  However, in many cases, it is easy enough to distance oneself from the "hive" temporarily to ease this stress.  Psychological maturity and
effective communication skills are thought to be a function of this ability.  In nearly every context, individual and collective behaviors are required to find a balance between inclusion and exclusion; for the individual, a matter of choice; for the
group, a matter of charter.  The sum of the creative energy (often referred to as "synergy") and the strength of the mechanisms that maintain this balance is manifest as an observable and resilient sense of community.
<br/><br/> McMillan and Chavis (1986) identify four elements of "sense of community": 1) membership, 2) influence, 3) integration and fulfillment of needs, and 4) shared emotional connection.  They give the following example of the interplay between these
factors: Someone puts an announcement on the dormitory bulletin board about the formation of an intramural dormitory basketball team.  People attend the organizational meeting as strangers out of their individual needs (integration and fulfillment of
needs).  The team is bound by place of residence (membership boundaries are set) and spends time together in practice (the contact hypothesis).  They play a game and win (successful shared valent event).  While playing, members exert energy on behalf of
the team (personal investment in the group).  As the team continues to win, team members become recognized and congratulated (gaining honor and status for being members).  Someone suggests that they all buy matching shirts and shoes (common symbols) and
they do so (influence).
<br/><br/> A Sense of Community Index (SCI) has been developed by Chavis and his colleagues (1986).  Although originally designed to assess sense of community in neighborhoods, the index has been adapted for use in schools, the workplace and a variety of
types of communities.
<br/><br/> Communitarianism as a group of related but distinct philosophies (or ideologies) began in the late 20th century, opposing classical liberalism, capitalism and socialism while advocating phenomena such as civil society.  Not necessarily hostile
to social liberalism, communitarianism rather has a different emphasis, shifting the focus of interest toward communities and societies and away from the individual.  The question of priority, whether for the individual or community, must be determined
in dealing with pressing ethical questions about a variety of social issues, such as health care, abortion, multiculturalism, and hate speech.
<br/><br/> Effective communication practices in group and organizational settings are important to the formation and maintenance of communities.  How ideas and values are communicated within communities are important to the induction of new members, the
formulation of agendas, the selection of leaders and many other aspects.  Organizational communication is the study of how people communicate within an organizational context and the influences and interactions within organizational structures.  Group
members depend on the flow of communication to establish their own identity within these structures and learn to function in the group setting.  Although organizational communication, as a field of study, is usually geared toward companies and business
groups, these may also be seen as communities.  The principles can also be applied to other types of communities.
<br/><br/> If the sense of community exists, both freedom and security exist as well.  The community then takes on a life of its own, as people become free enough to share and secure enough to get along.  The sense of connectedness and formation of social
networks comprise what has become known as social capital.
<br/><br/> Azadi Tower is a town square in modern Iran.  Social capital is defined by Robert D. Putnam as "the collective value of all social networks (who people know) and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other (norms
of reciprocity)." Social capital in action can be seen in groups of varying formality, including neighbors keeping an eye on each others' homes.  However, as Putnam notes in Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community (30000), social
capital has been falling in the United States.  Putnam found that over the past 25 years, attendance at club meetings has fallen 58 percent, family dinners are down 33 percent, and having friends visit has fallen 45 percent.
<br/><br/> Western cultures are thus said to be losing the spirit of community that once were found in institutions including churches and community centers.  Sociologist Ray Oldenburg states in The Great Good Place that people need three places: 1) The
home, 2) the workplace, and, 3) the community hangout or gathering place.
<br/><br/> With this philosophy in mind, many grassroots efforts such as The Project for Public Spaces are being started to create this "Third Place" in communities.  They are taking form in independent bookstores, coffeehouses, local pubs and through many
innovative means to create the social capital needed to foster the sense and spirit of community.
<br/><br/> Community development is often formally conducted by universities or government agencies to improve the social well-being of local, regional and, sometimes, national communities.  Less formal efforts, called community building or community
organizing, seek to empower individuals and groups of people by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities.  These skills often assist in building political power through the formation of large social groups
working for a common agenda.  Community development practitioners must understand both how to work with individuals and how to affect communities' positions within the context of larger social institutions.
<br/><br/> Formal programs conducted by universities are often used to build a knowledge base to drive curricula in sociology and community studies.  The General Social Survey from the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and the
Saguaro Seminar at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University are examples of national community development in the United States.  In The United Kingdom, Oxford University has led in providing extensive research in the field through
its Community Development Journal, used worldwide by sociologists and community development practitioners.
<br/><br/> At the intersection between community development and community building are a number of programs and organizations with community development tools.  One example of this is the program of the Asset Based Community Development Institute of
Northwestern University.  The institute makes available downloadable tools to assess community assets and make connections between non-profit groups and other organizations that can help in community building.  The Institute focuses on helping
communities develop by "mobilizing neighborhood assets"--building from the inside out rather than the outside in.
<br/><br/> Community building and organizing: M. Scott Peck is of the view that the almost accidental sense of community which exists at times of crisis, for example in New York City after the attacks of Sep. 11, 2001, can be consciously built.  Peck
believes that the process of "conscious community building" is a process of building a shared story, and consensual decision making, built upon respect for all individuals and inclusivity of difference.  He is of the belief that this process goes through
four stages:
<br/><br/> Pseudo-community: Where participants are "nice with each other", playing-safe, and presenting what they feel is the most favorable sides of their personalities.  Chaos: When people move beyond the inauthenticity of pseudo-community and feel safe
enough to present their "shadow" selves.  This stage places great demands upon the facilitator for greater leadership and organization, but Peck believes that "organizations are not communities", and this pressure should be resisted.
<br/><br/> Emptying: This stage moves beyond the attempts to fix, heal and convert of the chaos stage, when all people become capable of acknowledging their own woundedness and brokenness, common to us all as human beings.  Out of this emptying comes
<br/><br/> Authentic community: the process of deep respect and true listening for the needs of the other people in this community.  This stage Peck believes can only be described as "glory" and reflects a deep yearning in every human soul for
compassionate understanding from one's fellows.
<br/><br/> More recently Scott Peck has remarked that building a sense of community is easy.  It is maintaining this sense of community that is difficult in the modern world.  The Ithaca Hour is an example of community-based currency.  Community building
can use a wide variety of practices, ranging from simple events such as potlucks and small book clubs to larger-scale efforts such as mass festivals and construction projects that involve local participants rather than outside contractors.  Some
communities have developed their own "Local Exchange Trading Systems" (LETS) and local currencies, such as the Ithaca Hours system, to encourage economic growth and an enhanced sense of community.
<br/><br/> Community building that is geared toward activism is usually termed "community organizing." In these cases, organized community groups seek accountability from elected officials and increased direct representation within decision-making bodies. 
Where good-faith negotiations fail, these constituency-led organizations seek to pressure the decision-makers through a variety of means, including picketing, boycotting, sit-ins, petitioning, and electoral politics.  The ARISE Detroit! coalition and the
Toronto Public Space Committee are examples of activist networks committed to shielding local communities from government and corporate domination and inordinate influence.
<br/><br/> Community organizing is sometimes focused on more than just resolving specific issues.  Organizing often means building a widely accessible power structure, often with the end goal of distributing power equally throughout the community. 
Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are open and democratic in governance.  Such groups facilitate and encourage consensus decision-making with a focus on the general health of the community rather than a specific interest group.
<br/><br/> The three basic types of community organizing are grassroots organizing, coalition building, and faith-based community organizing (also called "institution-based community organizing," "broad-based community organizing" or "congregation-based
community organizing").
<br/><br/> Community service is usually performed in connection with a nonprofit organization, but it may also be undertaken under the auspices of government, one or more businesses, or by individuals.  It is typically unpaid and voluntary.  However, it
can be part of alternative sentencing approaches in a justice system and it can be required by educational institutions.
<br/><br/> The most common usage of the word "community" indicates a large group living in close proximity.  Examples of local community include: A municipality is an administrative local area generally composed of a clearly defined territory and commonly
referring to a town or village.  Although large cities are also municipalities, they are often thought of as a collection of communities, due to their diversity.
<br/><br/> A neighborhood is a geographically localized community, often within a larger city or suburb.  A planned community is one that was designed from scratch and grew up more or less following the plan.  Several of the world's capital cities are
planned cities, notably Washington, D.C., in the United States, Can berra in Australia, and Brasilia in Brazil.  It was also common during the European colonization of the Americas to build according to a plan either on fresh ground or on the ruins of
earlier Amerindian cities.  Identity: In some contexts, "community" indicates a group of people with a common identity other than location.  Members often interact regularly.  Common examples in everyday usage include: A "professional community" is a
group of people with the same or related occupations.  Some of those members may join a professional society, making a more defined and formalized group.
<br/><br/> These are also sometimes known as communities of practice.  A virtual community is a group of people primarily or initially communicating or interacting with each other by means of information technologies, typically over the Internet, rather
than in person.  These may be either communities of interest, practice or communion.  (See below.) Research interest is evolving in the motivations for contributing to online communities.
<br/><br/> Some communities share both location and other attributes.  Members choose to live near each other because of one or more common interests.  A retirement community is designated and at least usually designed for retirees and seniors--often
restricted to those over a certain age, such as 55.  It differs from a retirement home, which is a single building or small complex, by having a number of autonomous households.
<br/><br/> An intentional community is a deliberate residential community with a much higher degree of social interaction than other communities.  The members of an intentional community typically hold a common social, political or spiritual vision and
share responsibilities and resources.  Intentional communities include Amish villages, ashrams, cohousing, communes, ecovillages, housing cooperatives, kibbutzim, and land trusts.
<br/><br/> Special nature of human community Music in Central Park, a public space.  Definitions of community as "organisms inhabiting a common environment and interacting with one another," while scientifically accurate, do not convey the richness,
diversity and complexity of human communities.  Their classification, likewise is almost never precise.  Untidy as it may be, community is vital for humans.  M. Scott Peck expresses this in the following way: "There can be no vulnerability without risk;
there can be no community without vulnerability; there can be no peace, and ultimately no life, without community." This conveys some of the distinctiveness of human community.
<br/><br/> Embodiments described herein in FIGS. 14-41B govern a new kind of social network for neighborhoods, according to one embodiment (e.g., may be private and/or wiki-editable search engine based).  It should be noted that in some embodiments, the
address of an user may be masked from the public search (but still may be used for privacy considerations), according to one embodiment.  Some embodiments have no preseeded data, whereas others might.  Embodiments described herein may present rich,
location specific information on individual residents and businesses.
<br/><br/> A user can "Claim" one or more Business Pages and/or a Residential Pages, according to one embodiment.  In order to secure their Claim, the user may verify their location associated with the Business Page and/or Residential page within 30 days,
or the page becomes released to the community, according to one embodiment.  A user can only have a maximum of 3 unverified Claims out at any given time, according to one embodiment.  When a user clicks on "Claim this Page" on Business Profile page
and/or a Residential Profile page, they can indicate the manner in which they intend to verify their claim, according to one embodiment.  Benefits of Claiming a Business Page and/or Residential page may enable the user to mark their page `Self-Editable
only` from the default `Fully Editable` status, and see "Private" listings in a claimed neighborhood around the verified location, according to one embodiment.  Each edit by a user on a Residential Profile page and/or a Business Profile page may be made
visible on the profile page, along with a date stamp, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> Browse Function:
<br/><br/> Based on the user's current location, the browse function may display a local map populated with pushpins for location-specific information, and a news feed, made up of business page edits, public people page edits, any recent broadcasts, etc.,
according to one embodiment.  The news feed may show up on each Business Page and each Residential Page, based on activity in the surrounding area, according to one embodiment.  Secure a Neighborhood function: May allow the user to identify and "secure"
a neighborhood, restricting certain types of access to verified residents, according to one embodiment.  Add a Pushpin function: May allow any registered or verified user to add any type of Pushpin (as described in FIG. 36), to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> In addition to the map, the search results page may display a news feed, made up of business page edits, public people page edits, any recent broadcasts, and autogenerated alerts who has moved into the neighborhood, who has moved out of the
neighborhood, any recent reviews in the neighborhood, any pushpins placed in the immediate area, etc., according to one embodiment.  The news feed may prioritize entries relating to the search results, and will take into account privacy policies and
preferences, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> Example Newsfeeds may include:
<br/><br/> Joe Smith moved into the neighborhood in September 2013.  Welcome Joe! Like Share; 43 neighbors (hyperlink) moved in to the Cupertino library neighborhood in July 2013.  Like Share; 12 neighbors (hyperlink) verified in to the Cupertino library
neighborhood in July 2013.  Like Share; Raj Abhyanker invited Paul Smith, a guest to the Cupertino neighborhood.  Raj indicates Paul is a friend from college looking to move into the neighborhood.  Welcome Paul!: Raj Abhyanker posted a Nissan Leaf for
rent $35 a day, in mountain view Rent now.  Like Share
<br/><br/> This content may feed each Profile Page and helps to increase Search Engine value for content on the site, according to one embodiment.  Alerts may be created and curated (prioritized, filtered) automatically and/or through crowdsourcing, to
keep each page vibrant and actively updating on a regular basis (ideally once a day or more), according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> A Multi-Family Residence page will display a list of residents in the entire building, according to one embodiment.  Clicking on any resident will display a Single Family Residence page corresponding to the individual living unit where that
person resides, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> For example, suppose that John Smith and Jane Smith live in apartment 12 of a large building.  Their names are included in the list of residents.  When a user clicks on either John Smith or Jane Smith, we will display a "Single Family Residence"
page showing both John and Jane, just as if apartment 12 was a separate structure, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> The broadcast feature (e.g., associated with the neighborhood broadcast data and generated by the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of the social community module 2906) may be a "Radio" like function that uses the mobile device's current geospatial
location to send out information to neighbors around the present geospatial location of the user, according to one embodiment.  Broadcasts may be posted to neighbor pages in the geospatial vicinity (e.g., in the same neighborhood) on public and private
pages in the geospatial social network, according to one embodiment.  These broadcasts may enable any user, whether they live in a neighborhood or not to communicate their thoughts to those that live or work (or have claimed) a profile in the
neighborhood around where the broadcaster is physically at, regardless of where the broadcaster lives, according to one embodiment.  Broadcasts can be audio, video, pictures, and or text, according to one embodiment.  For accountability, the broadcaster
may be a verified user and their identity made public to all users who receive the broadcast in one embodiment.
<br/><br/> This means that the broadcast feature may be restricted to be used only by devices (e.g., mobile phones) that have a GPS chip (or other geolocation device) that an identify a present location of where the broadcast is originating from, according
to one embodiment.  The broadcast may be sent to all users who have claimed a profile in the geo spatial vicinity where the broadcast originates, according to one embodiment.  This can either be broadcast live to whoever is "tuned" in to a broadcast of
video, audio, picture, and text in their neighborhood, or can be posted on each users profile if they do not hear the broadcast to the neighborhood in a live mode in one embodiment.
<br/><br/> When a broadcast is made neighbors, around where the broadcast is made, they may receive a message that says something like:
<br/><br/> Raj Abhyanker, a user in Menlo Park just broadcast "Japanese cultural program" video from the Cupertino Union church just now.  Watch, Listen, View
<br/><br/> This broadcast may be shared with neighbors around Menlo park, and or in Cupertino.  This way, Raj's neighbors and those in Cupertino can know what is happening in their neighborhoods, according to one embodiment.  In one embodiment, the
broadcast only goes to one area (Cupertino or Menlo park in the example above).
<br/><br/> Broadcasts could be constrained to devices that have geospatial accuracy of present location and a current only (mobile devices for example).  Otherwise, broadcasts won't mean much, according to one embodiment (would otherwise be just like
thoughts/video upload without this).  Broadcasts shouldn't be confused with `upload videos`, according to one embodiment.  Different concepts.  Why? Broadcasts have an accuracy of time and location that cannot be altered by a user, according to one
embodiment.  Hence, mobile is the most likely medium for this not desktop computer, according to one embodiment.  We should not let the user set their own location for broadcasts (like other pushpin types), according to one embodiment.  Also time is
fixed, according to one embodiment.  Fixing and not making these two variables editable give users confidence that the broadcast was associated with a particular time and place, and creates a very unique feature, according to one embodiment.  For
example, it would be not useful if the broadcast is untrusted as to location of origination, according to one embodiment.  E.g., I broadcast when I am somewhere only about the location I am at, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> Broadcasts are different that other pushpins because location of where a broadcast, and time of broadcast is
<br/><br/> *current location* and *current time*, according to one embodiment.  They are initiated wherever a broadcaster is presently at, and added to the news feed in the broadcasters neighborhood and in the area wherever a broadcaster is presently at,
according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> Broadcast rules may include:
<br/><br/> 1.  If I post a Broadcast in my secured neighborhood, only my neighbors can see it, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> 2.  If I post a Broadcast in different secured neighborhood then my own, my neighbors can see it (e.g., unless I turn this off in my privacy setting) and neighbors in the secured neighborhood can see it (e.g., default not turn-offable, but I can
delete my broadcast), according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> 3.  If I post a Broadcast in different unsecured neighborhood then my own, my neighbors can see it (unless I turn this off in my privacy setting) and the broadcast is publicly visible on user pages of public user profiles in the unsecured
neighborhood until profiles are claimed and/or the neighborhood is secured, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> 4.  If an outsider in a secure neighborhood posts a broadcast in my secure neighborhood, it's not public, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> 5.  If an outsider in a unsecure neighborhood posts a broadcast in my secure neighborhood, the system does not post on profiles in his unsecure neighborhood (to prevent stalking, burglary), but does post in my secure neighborhood, according to
one embodiment.
<br/><br/> Privacy settings.  For each verified residential or business location, the user may set Privacy to Default, Public, Private, or Inactive, according to one embodiment.  The Default setting (which is the default) means that the profile will be
public, until the neighborhood is secured; in a secured neighborhood, the profile will be Private, according to one embodiment.  By changing this setting, the user may force the profile to be Public or Private, regardless of whether the neighborhood is
secured, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> For each verified residential location, the user may set edit access to Group Editable or Self Editable, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> Residential Privacy example.  The residential profiles can be: Public: anyone can search, browse, or view the user profile, according to one embodiment.  This is the default setting for unsecured neighborhoods (initially, all the content on the
site), according to one embodiment.  Private: only people in my neighborhood can search, browse, or view the user's profile, according to one embodiment.  This is the default for secured neighborhoods, according to one embodiment.  Inactive: nobody can
search, browse, or view the profile, even within a secured neighborhood, according to one embodiment.  A user may have at least one active (public or private), verified profile in order to have edit capabilities, according to one embodiment; if the user
makes all profiles inactive, that user is treated (for edit purposes) as an unverified user, according to one embodiment.

Joe containing the passcode to the lock 1204.  Joe may be able to open the lock 1204 and retrieve his new computer without leaving his home.
<br/><br/> In another example embodiment, Jenny may have broken her leg and be unable to get out of bed.  Her family may be out of town and she may have nobody to help her get groceries.  Jenny may be able to use the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100
(e.g., use her own, rent one from a neighbor, a company and/or the geospatially constrained social network 4242) to receive food from a local grocery store.  Jenny may be able to use the geospatially constrained social network 4242 to send the autonomous
neighborhood vehicle 100 to the store.  She may be able to send the store (e.g., employee working at the store, the store's profile on the geospatially constrained network etc.) a shopping list and/or may instruct the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100
to relay the list to the store.
<br/><br/> An employee at the store may load the requested items into the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100 and the vehicle may travel autonomously in the manor detailed above to Jenny's location, delivering the groceries.  In one embodiment, a financial
transaction may be carried out through the garage sale server 100.  Similar pick-ups and/or deliveries may be conducted with other entities such as Target.COPYRGT., Amazon.COPYRGT., retail stores, etc.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, a neighbor `Sam` may wish to sell his old iPhone to a neighbor Phil.  Sam may use the Fatdoor app on his mobile phone to sell his iPhone to neighbor Phil.  Sam may summon the Fatdoor rover (e.g., an autonomous neighborhood
vehicle 100 in Sam's neighborhood) to come and pick up his old iPhone.  The Fatdoor rover may be dispatched from a central location near City Hall, and come and pick up Sam's iPhone.  When the Fatdoor rover is arriving in a few minutes, Sam's phone may
get a text alert, notifying that Sam should load the rover once it arrives near his home in a few minutes.  The text message may include an `unlock` code to a storage chest (e.g., the storage compartment 101) of the autonomous Fatdoor rover.  Sam may us
the unlock code (e.g., using a near-field communication technology such as iBeacon, NFC and/or a keypad unlock code) to unlock the storage chest of the autonomous Fatdoor Rover (e.g., the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100).  Once loaded, Sam may secure
the cavity of the Fatdoor rover, and the rover may travel to a location of Phil's home to deliver the iPhone.  Once near Phil's home, Phil may also receive a text message notifying that the autonomous rover is near his front porch and a unique unlock
code (e.g., which may expire after a period of time).  Once Phil receives the iPhone, Sam may get paid by Phil.  Until then, money may be held in an escrow account with Fatdoor, Inc.  In an alternate embodiment, Sam may get paid earlier as soon as he
enters into a contract with Phil.  The Fatdoor rover may know how to get to Sam's house and/or Phil's house based on a `pick up` address of Sam and a `delivery` address of Phil entered during the transaction.  Further, an optimal pickup time may guide
the Fatdoor rover to pick up and deliver items at desired times in the neighborhood.  The Fatdoor rover may be an electric vehicle with a limited 25 to 40 mile round trip range.  Further, the Fatdoor rover may travel on sidewalks and/or bicycle lanes at
a maximum speed of 30 miles per hour.  The Fatdoor rover may have upon it a camera (e.g., a LIBOR camera), infrared sensors, laser sensors, and on board navigation.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, Phil may purchase a pizza from the neighborhood `Famiglia Pizzaria`, the best pizza this side of Texas through his desktop computer using Fatdoor (e.g., and/or another website such as familiapizzariaofHouston.com having
the Fatdoor Connect API integration).  Famiglia Pizzaria may have purchased two Fatdoor rovers for pizza deliveries in the neighborhood.  Once Phil places an order for pizza, the Fatdoor rovers (branded on the side with Famiglia Pizzaria) may deliver
pizza's to Phil's house once the pizzas come out of the oven.  Phil may be able to track and view the progress and estimated delivery time of his pizzas through his mobile device, and may even see the current location of the Fatdoor rover assigned to
deliver his pizza to him.  The storage compartment of the Fatdoor rovers used by Famiglia pizza may be heated to keep the pizzas warmth while in route.  The Fatdoor rovers (e.g., the autonomous neighborhood vehicle 100) may keep a log and centrally store
the video that they capture to ensure that there is no theft and/or breach of security of the storage compartment during transit.  Further, the Fatdoor rovers may be able to safely be able to navigate over sidewalks, yield signs, stop signs, people,
bikes, and cars in the roads as they navigate from Famiglia Pizzaria to Phil's home.  Once the pizzas are delivered, the Fatdoor rovers purchased by Famiglia may automatically make their way back to Famiglia's pizza headquarters for the next delivery.
<br/><br/> An example embodiment will now be described.  A person confronted with an emergency situation (e.g. the user 2916, the verified user 3506) may send a broadcast on a geospatially constrained social network 4200 (e.g. Fatdoor.com, Nextdoor.com). 
To accomplish this broadcast the person may generate the broadcast data 2902 which will be sent to the privacy server 2900 to generate the notification data 4212.  The notification data 4212 may include any information contained in the broadcast data
2902 such as the geospatial location, time, date, a textual description and live broadcast of audio and/or video generated by the user 2916.  The notification data 4212 may then be radially distributed in the area with a threshold radial distance 4219 of
the epicenter 4244 that may be the location of the device observing the emergency.  The person may be hoping for immediate assistance from other people living nearby (e.g. the recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950
2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29)) to help confront the emergency situation.  Rather than attempt to contact those living nearby individually, the person experiencing the emergency may broadcast the notification 4212 to proximate neighbors
simultaneously, maximizing the chance that a relevant person will appreciate, view and/or respond to the broadcast.
<br/><br/> Additionally, for example, the broadcast may even occur automatically upon the dialing of neighborhood services as to allow concurrent notification of nearby recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such
as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29) without detracting from a conventional mode of contacting emergency services (e.g. the emergency call 4000).  The emergency call 4000 may be monitored by the privacy server 2900 to automatically generate the neighborhood
broadcast data, including live audio of the call which the privacy server 2900 may use to create a transcript 4004.  The transcript 4004, along with metadata from the call that may include the geospatial location of the mobile device on which the call
was made may then be broadcast according to the social community module 2906 to nearby recipients (e.g., other users of the neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29).  The recipients (e.g., other users of the
neighborhood communication system 2950 2950 such as neighbors 2928 of FIG. 29) may then be notified of the emergency situation and/or prompted to respond without detracting from a call to the neighborhood services.
<br/><br/> For example, in an elementary school setting (e.g., the threshold radial distance 4219 may be set to a boundaries of the elementary school using the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of the social community module 2906).  A principal of the Sacred
Brooks Elementary School Mr. Higgins may hear gunshots that he believes are coming from an on-campus location.  Screams of panicked teachers and children may soon follow.  Mr. Higgins may use his mobile device (e.g., his cellular phone) to call an
emergency number `911`.  Calling this emergency number `911` may also trigger an automatic alert to the privacy server 2900 to generate the neighborhood broadcast data (or alternatively Mr. Higgins may separately send an emergency broadcast (e.g., a
neighborhood broadcast using the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of the social community module 2906) using the Fatdoor mobile application).  All teachers at the school and parents in adjacent neighborhoods may be instantly notified (e.g., through the
creation of the neighborhood broadcast data distributed as the notification data 4212).
<br/><br/> Wilson Brighton at the Fatdoor Emergency Center may receive a message that there is an emergency at the Sacred Brooks Elementary school.  Wilson Brighton may open up a communication channel with Mr. Brighton and invite adjacent neighborhoods and
medical professionals having claimed profiles and/or living in the area to help.  In addition, Wilson may merge the emergency transmissions into a single session so that Mr. Higgins initial emergency broadcast (e.g., a neighborhood broadcast using the
Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of the social community module 2906) is automatically merged with related other broadcasts by teachers, parents, staff, and children at the school.  This single thread of broadcasts related to the Sacred Brooks Elementary
school may be provided as live-feed emergency broadcast (e.g., a neighborhood broadcast using the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of the social community module 2906) is to all users of Fatdoor.com having a claimed profile (e.g., a home address and/or a work
address) within the threshold radial distance 4219 from Mr. Higgins (e.g., the epicenter 4244 of the broadcast).  Even when parents are at work, they may still receive the broadcast live on their mobile devices because they have downloaded the Fatdoor
application and have claimed their home/business address around a location of the emergency.
<br/><br/> As a result, local neighborhood parents may arrive from their work locations, even when they work at a different location than where they live.  This may save lives at the Sacred Brooks elementary school because help may arrive sooner.
<br/><br/> For example, one recipient of Mr. Higgin's broadcast may be Samuel Wilson ("Sam"), who has two children at Sacred Brooks Elementary School: John, a bright kindergartener 6, and Samantha, a talented artist of age 10.  Sam may be alerted even when
he is at work on a construction site 6 miles away from the Sacred Brooks Elementary School where John and Samatha are located.  Sam may receive an alert on his mobile phone that there is an emergency in his neighborhood.  Jumping into his truck, Sam may
drive to the school to render assistance, tuning in to the live broadcast as events unfold.  Others may join in and as well and communicate and provide instructions and reassurance to Mr. Higgins and other broadcasters.
<br/><br/> Nearby resident Chen Su, whose backyard fence adjoins the playground of Sacred Brooks, may also receive the broadcast.  Chen may run outside and unlock his gate, opening it so that children may not be trapped in the playground area.  Chen may
then send a separate broadcast a new escape route has been established.  Mr. Higgins may gather as many nearby children as he can and lead them safety through Chen's gate.
<br/><br/> Henry Stewart, a decorated army veteran who lives a few blocks away from Sacred Brooks Elementary, may also receive the broadcast.  Alarmed for the safety of the children, and knowing that it may take the police several minutes to arrive at the
school, Henry may decide that it will maximize the children chance at survival if he is the first responder.  Equipping his .22 caliber rifle, he may run to the school and distract or defeat the shooter in time to save many lives.
<br/><br/> Similarly, Dr. Juan Sanchez, M.D.  may have an office in the neighborhood immediately adjacent to Sacred Brooks.  Dr. Sanchez and his team of medical professionals may rush to the scene, engaging in bi-directional communications with the school
staff during the live broadcast event so that he knows exactly which building to arrive at. Calming victims and putting pressure on wounds until ambulances arrive, Dr. Sanchez and his team may save the lives of wounded children.
<br/><br/> When the incident is over, many people may want to recreate the events for journalistic or evidentiary purposes.  They may also want to study generally the flow of information during emergencies in their neighborhood, and decide how their school
could better prepare.  Similarly, they may want to ensure they are part of the broadcast system in cast there are future incidents.  Persons who have not yet claimed their verified profiles in the area surrounding Sacred Brooks Elementary School on
Fatdoor may go online and find profiles pre-seeded with data associated with their address.  Those pre-seeded profiles may have been updated with local broadcasts.  These people may be able to claim their profile and have access to previous broadcasts,
including those associated with the school shootings.  This may help them to better prepare for the safety of their children.
<br/><br/> Because of the technologies described herein, the neighborhood, city, and country is a better place because emergency response teams are supplemented with information from those who have a claimed geo-spatial location around a neighborhood in
which there is trouble.  In addition, evidence may be formed that is admissible to prove guilt of the gunmen, defeat a defense of insanity, or impose a maximum sentence.
<br/><br/> In another example, a user Bob Jones may be walking around Menlo Park, Calif.  when he observes a robber pull out a knife and threaten to harm Paula Nelson in a parking lot if she does not give the robber her car keys.  Bob may take out his
mobile device and select the emergency listing criteria "major violent crime" in the user interface of the mobile application that communicates with the emergency response server.  Bob may center his viewfinder on the unfolding robbery and select the
"broadcast live" indicator on the user interface, as well as entering the brief description "Car jacking in progress" in a small data field.  The broadcast data, including live video and audio, may be generated and sent to the emergency response server
where it may be radially distributed to user profiles at a threshold radial distance 4219 from the epicenter 4244 centered on Bob's mobile device.  Because Bob specified the emergency as a "major violent crime" its threshold radial distance 4219 may be
larger than if Bob had selected mere "vandalism."
<br/><br/> To further illustrate, several relevant parties may receive the broadcast.  Patrick Sloan, an off-duty police detective, is alerted to Bob Jones' broadcast data by a notification sent to his mobile device.  Patrick, looks his mobile device to
read Bob's brief description, and notices that the event is only "0.3 miles away." Patrick selects the "respond indicator" to let Bob know he is on his way, and also selects "dial broadcaster" to establish a bi-directional communication with Bob.  A map
on Patrick's mobile device and a set of directions may show Patrick the fastest way to travel to the epicenter 4244, along with warning Patrick when he is within 2900 yards of the emergency.
<br/><br/> Jason Steinbrenner, a retired surgeon, also receives Bob's broadcast.  Jason opts to view Bob's live video feed.  Jason notices that the robber severely lacerates Paula with his knife as he grabs Paula's keys away.  Jason sees that he is only
0.7 miles away from the emergency and also selects the "respond indicator" to let Bob know he will arrive shortly.  Through his user interface he sends Bob a text message "I'm a doctor."
<br/><br/> Jane Doe, a resident living within the threshold radial distance 4219 also receives Bob's broadcast.  Jane, while viewing Bob's live feed, takes note of the vehicle make, model and color.  As the robber gets in Paula's car and drives away, out
of Bob's view, Jane goes to her apartment window and looks outside.  A minute later, Jane sees the woman's car, driven by the robber, headed down her street, trying to keep a low profile.  Jane generates her own broadcast including a video feed of the
car stopped at a stoplight.  Patrick Sloan, driving his car to reach Bob's location, receives Jane's broadcast.  Patrick, now using Jane's epicenter 4244, redirects his path to intercept the robber.  Using Jane's live video broadcast to remotely view the
intersection, Patrick is able to safely approach the robber from behind and surprise him at the stoplight, capturing him.
<br/><br/> Emergency services, which may subscribe to all emergency broadcast (e.g., a neighborhood broadcast using the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of the social community module 2906) is within the threshold radial distance 4219 of the epicenter 4244, may
also have been notified.  The police department and an ambulance arrive after Patrick catches the robber and Jason stabilizes the woman.
<br/><br/> Bob and Jane may receive a summary of their broadcast data that shows them how many recipients received his broadcast, the emergency services contacted, and who was responding.  Their broadcast submissions may also include a unique identifies
such that the live video, recorded by the emergency response server, which may be later retrieved to provide evidence against the robber with a unique identification code.
<br/><br/> Because of the emergency response sever described in FIGS. 1-11, Jason was able to arrive on the scene faster than emergency services, putting pressure on Paula's wound to prevent detrimental bleeding.  The broadcast system also allowed Patrick
to catch the perpetrator both because he was a concerned local resident and because other nearby residents, such as Jane, were alerted by Bob's original broadcast and were therefore prepared to provide additional helpful broadcasts.
<br/><br/> Bob and Jane may live in the Lorelei neighborhood of Menlo Park, and for this reason receive the emergency broadcast data (e.g., a neighborhood broadcast generated by the social community module 2906).  If Bob creates an emergency broadcast, Bob
may choose to restrict dissemination of his emergency broadcast just to the Lorelei neighborhood because it is an `active` neighborhood around where Bob lives.  Particularly, a minimum number of Bob's neighbors in the Lorelei neighborhood, such as 10
neighbors in the Lorelei neighborhood, may have signed up and verified their profiles through an online neighborhood social network (e.g., Fatdoor.com).  If Bob is the first user that creates a private network for his neighborhood (e.g., a `founding
member`), he may need to draw geospatial boundaries and/or claim geospatial boundaries around his neighborhood and invite a threshold number of neighbors (e.g., 10 neighbors) to activate it.  An amount of time for Bob to invite and activate his
neighborhood may be limited (e.g., 21 days).  However, Bob may request an extension of time from the privacy server 2900 if Bob needs more time to invite users, and the privacy server 2900 may grant this extra time.  In other words, if Bob is a founding
member, he may have the ability to define the neighborhood boundary and choose the neighborhood name.
<br/><br/> The privacy server 2900 may internally make corrections to either the boundaries or name that Bob set based on feedback from other neighbors and/or based on internal policies.  These internal policies may include a preference for a use of
official names for a community (e.g., based on local thoroughfares, a nearby park, or landmark for inspiration), a neighborhood name that is short and sweet (e.g., eliminating unnecessary words like city, state, neighbors, neighborhood, HOA, friends,
etc.), with correct capitalization (e.g., to ensure that a first letter of each word is capitalized), and/or use of spaces between each word in a neighborhood name.  In one embodiment, Bob may designate neighborhood `leads` who can adjust boundaries of
their neighborhood through an adjust boundaries tool.  Bob may be part of an elite group of neighborhood `leads` who keep the privacy server 2900 operating smoothly by organizing information and posting neighborhood-wide information.  The neighborhood
leads like Bob may have special privileges such as removing inappropriate messages, adjusting neighborhood boundaries, verifying unverified members, editing the about section on a neighborhood feed, and/or promoting other members to become neighborhood
leads.
<br/><br/> Bob and his neighbors may have each verified their addresses through a postcard verification system in which they received a postcard at their home with an access code that permits each of them to access their private Lorelei neighborhood
community information including emergency broadcast alerts in the online neighborhood social network (e.g., the Fatmail postcard system through which an access code may have been received at a respective Lorelei home that uniquely identifies and verifies
a home in the Lorelei neighborhood).  Bob may have invited a threshold number (e.g., 10) of his Lorelei neighbors prior to the Lorelei neighborhood becoming active.  Bob may choose to disseminate his emergency broadcast data to a neighborhood adjacent to
Lorelei, such as Menlo Park downtown (e.g., using the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of the social community module 2906).  Optionally, Bob may choose to restrict his emergency broadcast data just to Lorelei neighbors (e.g., using the Bezier curve algorithm
3040 of the social community module 2906).  In other words, users of the neighborhood social network in an entirely different neighborhood, such as the Financial District neighborhood of San Francisco (about 20 miles away) may not be able to access the
emergency broadcast data that Bob generates.
<br/><br/> For example, the emergency broadcast data may be disseminated to adjacent neighborhoods that have been claimed by different users in a manner such that the emergency broadcast data is optionally disseminated to the surrounding claimed
neighborhoods based on Bob's preference.
<br/><br/> It will be understood with those skill in the art that in some embodiments, the social community module 2906 may restrict dissemination of broadcast data by verified users to claimed neighborhoods in a private neighborhood social network (e.g.
the privacy server 2900 may be a private social network, the neighborhood curation system described herein may also be part of the private neighborhood social network) in which the broadcaster resides (e.g., has a home) using the radial algorithm 4241
(e.g., the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30).  The privacy server 2900 may include online communities designed to easily create private websites to facilitate communication among neighbors and build stronger neighborhoods (e.g., to help neighbors
build stronger and safer neighborhoods).
<br/><br/> Further, it follows that the threshold radial distance 4219 generated through the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 may take on a variety of shapes other than purely circular and is defined to encompass a variety of shapes based on
associated geographic, historical, political and/or cultural connotations of associated boundaries of neighborhoods and/or as defined by a city, municipality, government, and/or data provider (e.g., Maponics.RTM., Urban Mapping.RTM.), in one embodiment. 
For example, the threshold radial distance 4219 may be based on a particular context, such as a school boundary, a neighborhood boundary, a college campus boundary, a subdivision boundary, a parcel boundary, and/or a zip code boundary.  In an alternate
embodiment, a first claiming user 2916 in a particular neighborhood may draw a polygon to indicate a preferred boundary.
<br/><br/> In an alternative embodiment, the threshold radial distance 4219 generated using the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 by the privacy server 2900 may be restricted to a shared apartment building (e.g., and/or an office building).  In addition, it will
be understood with those skilled in the art that the privacy server 2900 may be operate as a function of the privacy server 2900 (e.g., a neighborhood social network).
<br/><br/> In addition, it will be understood that in some embodiments, the neighborhood broadcast data is generated by the police department (e.g., and/or others of the neighborhood services) in the form of crime alerts, health alerts, fire alerts, and
other emergency alerts and provided as a feed (e.g., a Real Simple Syndication (RSS) feed) to the privacy server 2900 for distribution to relevant ones of the claimed neighborhoods in the privacy server 2900.  It will be understood that the neighborhood
broadcast data may appear in a `feed` provided to users of the privacy server 2900 (e.g., a private social network for neighbors) on their profile pages based on access control privileges set by the social community module using the Bezier curve
algorithm 3040.  For example, access to the neighborhood broadcast data may be limited to just a claimed neighborhood (e.g., as defined by neighborhood boundaries) and/or optionally adjacent neighborhoods.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the privacy server 2900 may provide police departments and other municipal agencies with a separate login in which they can invite neighbors themselves, provide for a virtual neighborhood watch and emergency preparedness
groups, and conduct high value crime and safety related discussions from local police and fire officials without requiring any technical integration.  This may provide police departments and municipalities with a single channel to easily broadcast
information across neighborhoods that they manage, and receive and track neighborhood level membership and activity to identify leaders of a neighborhood.
<br/><br/> For example, communications defined from one broadcasting user to an adjacent neighborhood o may involve sharing information about a suspicious activity that might affect several neighborhoods, explaining about a lost pet that might have
wandered into an adjoining neighborhood, to rally support from neighbors from multiple neighborhoods to address civic issues, to spread the word about events like local theater production or neighborhood garage sales, and/or to ask for advice or
recommendations from the widest range of people in a community).  In one embodiment, the privacy server 2900 may prevent self-promotional messages that are inappropriate (e.g., a user sending such messages may be suspended from the geospatially
constrained social network 4242 using the crowd sourced moderation algorithm 3004.  In one embodiment, the user 2916 may personalize nearby neighborhoods so that the user can choose exactly which nearby neighborhoods (if any) they wish to communicate
with.  The user 2916 may be able to flag a neighborhood feeds from adjacent neighborhoods.  In addition, leaders from a particular neighborhood may be able to communicate privately with leaders of an adjoining neighborhood to plan and organize on behalf
of an entire constituency.  Similarly, users 2906 may be able to filter feeds to only display messages from the neighborhood that they reside in. The user 2916 may be able to restrict posts (e.g., pushpin placements) only in the neighborhood they are
presently in. In one embodiment, nearby neighbors may (or may not) be able to access profiles of adjacent neighborhoods.
<br/><br/> It will also be understood that in some embodiments, that users may be `verified through alternate means, for example through a utility bill verification (e.g., to verify that a user's address on a utility bill matches the residential address
they seek to claim), a credit card verification (e.g., or debit card verification), a phone number verification (e.g., reverse phone number lookup), a privately-published access code (e.g., distributed to a neighborhood association president, and/or
distributed at a neighborhood gathering), and a neighbor vouching method (e.g., in which an existing verified neighbor `vouches` for a new neighbor as being someone that they personally know to be living in a neighborhood.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the privacy server 2900 ensures a secure and trusted environment for a neighborhood website by requiring all members to verify their address.  In this embodiment, verification may provide assurance the assurance that new
members are indeed residing at the address they provided when registering for an account in the privacy server 2900.  Once a neighborhood has launched out of pilot status, only members who have verified their address may be able access to their
neighborhood website content.
<br/><br/> It will be understood that among the various ways of verifying an address, a user of the privacy server 2900 may uses the following methods to verify the address of every member:
<br/><br/> A. Postcard.  The privacy server 2900 can send a postcard to the address listed on an account of the user 2916 with a unique code printed on it (e.g., using the Fatmail postcard campaign).  The code may allow the user 2916 to log in and verify
their account.
<br/><br/> B. Credit or debit card.  The privacy server 2900 may be able to verify a home address through a credit or debit card billing address.  In one embodiment, billing address may be confirmed without storing personally identifiable information
and/or charging a credit card.
<br/><br/> C. Home phone.  If a user 2916 has a landline phone, the user may receive an automated phone call from the privacy server 2900 that may provide with a unique code to verify an account of the user 2916.
<br/><br/> D. Neighborhood leader.  A neighborhood leader of the geo-spatially constrained social network can use a verify neighbors feature of the privacy server 2900 to vouch for and verify neighbors.
<br/><br/> E. Mobile phone.  A user 2916 may receive a call to a mobile phone associated with the user 2916 to verify their account.
<br/><br/> F. Neighbor invitations.  A neighbor who is a verified member of the privacy server 2900 can vouch for, and may invite another neighbor to join the privacy server 2900.  Accepting such an invitation may allow the user 2916 to join the privacy
server 2900 as a verified member, according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> H. Social Security Number (SSN).  The privacy server 2900 can verify a home address when the user 2916 provides the last 4 digits of a SSN (e.g., not stored by the privacy server 2900 for privacy reasons).
<br/><br/> It will be also understood that in a preferred embodiment neighborhood boundaries are defined by the social community module 2906 using the Bezier curve algorithm 3040 of FIG. 30 may be constrained to work in neighborhoods having a threshold
number of homes (e.g., 10 homes, alternatively 2900 homes in a neighborhood) and more (e.g., up to thousands of homes) as this may be needed to reach the critical mass of active posters that is needed to help the privacy server 2900 succeed.  In one
embodiment, `groups` may be creatable in smaller neighborhoods having fewer than the threshold number of homes for communications in micro-communities within a claimed neighborhood.
<br/><br/> It will also be appreciated that in some embodiments, a mobile device (e.g., the device 1806, the device 1808 of FIG. 18) may be a desktop computer, a laptop computer, and/or a non-transitory broadcasting module.  In addition, it will be
understood that the prepopulated data (e.g., preseeded data) described herein may not be created through data licensed from others, but rather may be user generated content of organically created profiles in the geo-spatial social network created by
different users who have each verified their profiles.
<br/><br/> Although the present embodiments have been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope
of the various embodiments.  For example, the various devices, modules, analyzers, generators, etc. described herein may be enabled and operated using hardware circuitry (e.g., CMOS based logic circuitry), firmware, software and/or any combination of
hardware, firmware, and/or software (e.g., embodied in a machine readable medium).  For example, the various electrical structure and methods may be embodied using transistors, logic gates, and electrical circuits (e.g., application specific integrated
ASIC circuitry and/or in Digital Signal; Processor DSP circuitry).
