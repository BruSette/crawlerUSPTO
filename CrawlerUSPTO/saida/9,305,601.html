       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A system and method for generating a synchronized mix of a plurality of
     audiovisual tracks is provided. A new audiovisual track may be recorded
     simultaneously while one or more other audiovisual tracks are being
     played to help simulate a live jam session as closely as possible. In a
     "DJ Mix" mode, a user may manipulate sequencing and/or characteristics
     related to one or more audiovisual tracks included in a project in
     real-time while the project (e.g., song) is being played. A synchronized
     mix of a plurality of audiovisual tracks may be generated based on
     various attributes associated with the audiovisual tracks. For example,
     audiovisual tracks that are recorded along with a metronome may be
     synchronized based on a metronome clock rate selected by a user.

<br/><br/> The disclosure relates to systems and methods for playing one or more audiovisual tracks, simultaneously recording a new audiovisual track and/or modifications made to the one or more audiovisual tracks in real-time during the play to generate a
synchronized audiovisual mix, and/or communicating the mix to a user in real-time.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> Many musicians gather together in a physical location and have live jam sessions with other musicians.  Live jam sessions facilitate collaborations between musicians, help building a community for exchanging talents and ideas with other
musicians, and provide opportunities to practice together in preparing for a recording session.
<br/><br/> Conventional systems have been developed in an attempt to facilitate music collaborations between remote performers via computer network connections.  For example, participants of a jam session who are unable to gather up in a physical location
may input data streams of their performance to contribute to the jam session.  However, a live jam session cannot be properly held when the data streams to be contributed to the jam session are made at different times.
<br/><br/> Thus, what is needed is to be capable of simulating the experience and excitement of live jam sessions between musicians who perform from different remote locations and at different times.  What is further needed is to be capable of creating a
mix of a plurality of tracks each of which includes both audio and video data such that a user may experience and enjoy full auditory and visual effects of the jam session.  These and other problems may exist.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The disclosure relates to systems and methods for playing one or more audiovisual tracks, simultaneously recording a new audiovisual track and/or modifications made to the one or more audiovisual tracks in real-time during the play to generate a
synchronized audiovisual mix, and/or communicating the mix to a user in real-time.  An audiovisual track may include a video clip of a musical performance such as a performance of a musical instrument, a vocal performance, video clips of various other
types of performances (e.g., dance performances, comedy performances, etc.), and/or video clips of various types of sound.
<br/><br/> By simultaneously recording a new audiovisual track while other audiovisual tracks are being played back such that the new audiovisual track can be combined with the other tracks in real-time, it enables a user to simulate the experience and
excitement of a live jam session.  A user may listen and view how a plurality of audiovisual tracks are combined together to generate a synchronized mix as the user records a musical performance within the mix.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the system may include a computer that facilitates generating a synchronized audiovisual mix using simultaneous recording and live playback of audiovisual tracks.  The computer may include one or more processors configured
to perform some or all of a functionality of a plurality of modules.  For example, the one or more processors may be configured to execute a project creation module, a track recording module, a synchronization module, a mixer module, a communication
module, a user interface module, and/or other modules.
<br/><br/> The project creation module may be configured to obtain a project by creating a new project and/or retrieving an existing project from a media library and/or media sharing service.  A project may include audiovisual tracks that may be combined
together into a mix.  For example, a project may be a particular song, and audiovisual tracks of the project may include a video clip of a performer's playing the keyboard, playing the drum, singing the song, etc.
<br/><br/> The project creation module may obtain project attributes related to the project such as the name of the project (e.g., song title), the name of the project creator (e.g., artist name), notes, date and time that the project was created and/or
modified, metronome properties, project time duration, relative start and end times of audiovisual tracks that are included in the project, pitch (e.g., "C"), key (e.g., "major" or "minor"), and/or one or more identifications of the audiovisual tracks. 
In addition, the project creation module may be configured to obtain track attributes related to individual audiovisual tracks included in the project such as the name of the track (e.g., "drum," "keyboard," and/or other track titles), the name of the
track creator (e.g., performer name), notes, date and time that the track was created, recorded, and/or modified, metronome properties, track time duration, pitch, key, and/or one or more identifications of "DJ Mix" records ("DJ Mix Record IDs").
<br/><br/> The project creation module may be configured to add audiovisual tracks to the new project and/or existing project by recording new tracks and/or importing existing tracks from the media library and/or from various media sharing services (e.g.,
YouTube, Hulu, etc.).
<br/><br/> The track recording module may be configured to create a new audiovisual track by recording an audiovisual input from an audiovisual capture device.  In some embodiments, the track recording module may be configured to create a new audiovisual
track to be added to a project by simultaneously recording the audiovisual input while other existing tracks of the project are being played.  In this way, the track recording module may layer a new audiovisual track over other existing audiovisual
tracks in real-time.  This may allow a user to perform a musical instrument while listening to and watching visual performance of other parts of the song to help simulate a live jam session as closely as possible.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the track recording module may start recording an audiovisual input from the beginning of an existing track being played back.  In other embodiments, the track recording module may add a new track at a certain point in time
in the middle of a particular existing track being played back.  This technique may be useful, for example, when a user wants to insert a solo part (e.g., guitar solo) in the middle of a song.
<br/><br/> The synchronization module may be configured to synchronize a plurality of audiovisual tracks in a project by specifying or otherwise updating one or more track attributes and/or project attributes including metronome properties (as related to a
particular audiovisual track and/or the project), pitch, key, project time duration, relative start and end times of audiovisual tracks that are included in the project, and/or one or more identifications of the audiovisual tracks based on tracks being
added to and/or deleted from the project.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the synchronization module may be configured to specify or otherwise update metronome properties including whether a metronome is enabled or disabled for the track, a metronome clock rate (e.g., BPM), and/or the volume and
sound of the metronome.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, when recording a new audiovisual track in the project, the synchronization module may be configured to determine whether the metronome is enabled or disabled based on the metronome properties associated with the project
before starting to record the new track.  Based on this determination, the synchronization module may determine whether to turn on or off the metronome while recording the new track.  When it is turned on, a user may hear the metronome at a clock rate
(as specified by the metronome properties associated with the project) in the background while recording the new track such that the timing and tempo of the plurality of audiovisual tracks in the project may be synchronized.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, when importing an existing audiovisual track from the media library and/or media sharing services to the project, the synchronization module may be configured to determine whether the metronome clock rate associated with the
project is the same as or different from a metronome clock rate associated with the imported track.  The metronome clock rate associated with the imported track may be adjusted according to the metronome clock rate associated with the project in order to
synchronize the imported track with the rest of audiovisual tracks included in the project.
<br/><br/> Whenever an additional track is added to a particular project by recording new tracks and/or importing existing tracks, the synchronization module may be configured to specify or otherwise update relative start and end times of the audiovisual
tracks in order to ensure that the tracks can be successfully combined as one synchronized mix.  Furthermore, based on the relative start and end times of individual audiovisual tracks included in the project, the synchronization module may be configured
to specify or otherwise update the project time duration for that particular project.  For example, the synchronization module may compare the relative end times associated with individual tracks included in the project with one another and/or identify
the latest end time.  In this example, the latest end time may be used to specify or otherwise determine the project time duration for the project.
<br/><br/> The mixer module may be configured to activate a "disk-jockey (DJ) Mix" mode and/or simultaneously record the changes and/or modifications made to "DJ Mix" settings associated with individual audiovisual tracks in a project while the project
(e.g., the entire collection of audiovisual tracks included in the project) is being played back.  In other words, while the project is being played back, mixer module 114 may record a user's DJ actions that change and/or modify sequencing and/or
characteristics related to one or more audiovisual tracks included in the project.
<br/><br/> "DJ Mix" settings may include deleting of a track, looping a part of a track, changing the volume of a track, muting the volume, hiding a track, and/or changing the position of a track on a screen.  An individual track may be associated with one
or more "DJ Mix" records where each "DJ Mix" record may comprise information related to a particular "DJ Mix" setting.  For example, a "DJ Mix" record associated a particular track may include a default value of 7 for the volume.  If a user changes the
volume for this track via mixer module 114 while the project is being played back, the "DJ Mix" record may be updated to include the new value for the volume and a point in time at which the volume was changed.
<br/><br/> The mixer module may be configured to generate a synchronized mix of a plurality of audiovisual tracks included in a project based on the selected options and/or changes for the "DJ Mix" settings that have been simultaneously recorded during the
playback of the project.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the communication module may be configured to communicate a synchronized mix via a user interface such that a user may listen and view the mix being played.  In some embodiments, the communication module may enable live
playback of the mix while an audiovisual input is being recorded.  For example, a user may listen and view the mix being played as the user records a musical performance.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the user interface module may be configured to generate user interfaces that allow interaction with projects and audiovisual tracks.  For example, the user interface module may present various displays for creating projects,
recording audiovisual tracks, synchronizing the tracks, and/or mixing the tracks.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a system 100 of generating a synchronized mix of audiovisual tracks, according to an aspect of the invention.  An audiovisual track may include a video clip of a musical performance such as a performance of a musical
instrument, a vocal performance, and/or other video clips of various other types of performances (e.g., dance performances, comedy performances, etc.), and/or video clips of various types of sound.  An audiovisual track may include audio information,
video information, and/or other information (e.g., metronome information, still image information, etc.) that facilitates presentation of the performance associated with the audiovisual track to a user.  The audiovisual track may be stored within one or
more electronic files.
<br/><br/> System 100 may include a computer 110, media sharing services 140, client devices 150, and/or other components.  In some embodiments, computer 110 may include one or more processors 120 configured to perform some or all of a functionality of a
plurality of modules, which may be stored in a memory 121.  For example, the one or more processors 120 may be configured to execute a project creation module 111, a tracking recording module 112, a synchronization module 113, a mixer module 114, a
communication module 115, a user interface module 116, and/or other modules 119.
<br/><br/> Project creation module 111 may be configured to obtain a project by creating a new project and/or retrieving an existing project from a media library 132.  A project may include one or more audiovisual tracks that may be combined together to
generate a mix.  For example, a project may be a particular song, and audiovisual tracks of the project may include a video clip of a performer's playing the keyboard, playing the drum, singing the song, etc. In some embodiments, a project and/or a
resulting mix may include a single audiovisual track.  Media library 132 may include a local repository and/or an online repository (e.g., a cloud-based data repository).
<br/><br/> Project creation module 111 may obtain project attributes related to the project such as the name of the project (e.g., song title), the name of the project creator (e.g., artist name), notes, date and time that the project was created and/or
modified, metronome properties, project time duration, relative start and end times of audiovisual tracks that are included in the project, pitch (e.g., "C"), key (e.g., "major" or "minor"), and/or one or more identifications of the audiovisual tracks. 
The project attributes are associated with a unique project identification ("Project ID") assigned for the particular project.  The project attributes may be automatically generated by computer 110 and/or determined based on user input.  For example, a
user may specify the name of the project and the name of the project creator and/or provide notes when a project is created and/or updated.
<br/><br/> In addition, project creation module 111 may be configured to obtain track attributes related to individual audiovisual tracks included in the project such as the name of the track (e.g., "drum," "keyboard," and/or other track titles), the name
of the track creator (e.g., performer name), notes, date and time that the track was created, recorded, and/or modified, metronome properties, track time duration, pitch, key, and/or one or more identifications of "DJ Mix" records ("DJ Mix Record IDs"). 
The track attributes are associated with a unique track identification ("Track ID") assigned for the particular track where each Track ID may be associated with one or more Project IDs of particular projects to which the track belongs.  The track
attributes may be automatically generated by computer 110 and/or determined based on user input.  For example, a user may specify the name of the track and the name of the track creator and/or provide notes when an audiovisual track is created and/or
updated.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, project creation module 111 may be configured to create a new project.  Project creation module 111 may create the new project according to one or more project attributes (e.g., the name of the project, the name of the
project creator, etc.) received from a user.  In some embodiments, project creation module 111 may be configured to retrieve an existing project from media library 132.  Media library 132 may include projects created by and/or audiovisual tracks recorded
by various users.  A user may specify access control preferences (e.g., privacy preferences) for the projects and/or audiovisual tracks associated with the user in media library 132.  For example, a user may freely select and import existing projects
and/or audiovisual tracks associated with the user.  On the other hand, permission may be required to access another user's projects and/or audiovisual tracks depending on the access control preferences.  The access control preferences associated with
individual users may be stored in a user profile 134.
<br/><br/> Project creation module 111 may be configured to add audiovisual tracks to the new project and/or existing project by recording new tracks and/or importing existing tracks from media library 132.  Project creation module 111 may determine
whether to import a particular existing audiovisual track that a user selects based on the access control preference stored in user profile 134.  Furthermore, audiovisual tracks available in various media sharing services 140 such as YouTube, Hulu, etc.
may also be imported and added to the project.
<br/><br/> Project creation module 111 may be configured to search for a particular existing project and/or a particular existing track to add and/or import from media library 132 and/or media sharing services 140 using any one of the project attributes
and/or track attributes discussed herein.  For example, a user may be looking for a solo part that is made in a particular key (e.g., "major" or "minor").  In this case, the user may search within media library 132 and/or media sharing services 140 for
audiovisual tracks made in that particular key.
<br/><br/> Track recording module 112 may be configured to create a new audiovisual track by recording an audiovisual input from an audiovisual capture device.  Track recording module 112 may receive an audiovisual input such as a performer's playing a
musical instrument via the audiovisual capture device.  A client device (e.g., a client device 150A) may comprise the audiovisual capture device which may be used to capture and transmit audio data and/or video images via a microphone and/or a video
camera or webcam.  Track recording module 112 may switch the video camera (or webcam) on and off and/or may adjust the direction of the camera based on user input.  Similarly, the microphone may be muted and/or the volume of the microphone may be
adjusted.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, track recording module 112 may be configured to create a new audiovisual track to be added to a project by simultaneously recording an audiovisual input while other existing tracks of the project are being played.  In these
embodiments, a user may select one or more existing tracks currently included in the project to be played.  A user may also select the entire tracks of the project to be played at the same time.  The user may then record a new audiovisual track in
real-time while the selected tracks are being played.  In this way, track recording module 112 may layer a new audiovisual track over other existing audiovisual tracks in real-time.  This may allow a user to perform a musical instrument, for example,
while listening to and watching visual performance of other parts of the song to help simulate a live jam session as closely as possible.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, track recording module 112 may start recording an audiovisual input from the beginning of an existing track being played back.  In this way, the start time of the new audiovisual track being created may be the same as the
start time of the existing track.  In other embodiments, track recording module 112 may add a new track at a certain point in time in the middle of a particular existing track being played back.  This technique may be useful, for example, when a user
wants to insert a solo part (e.g., guitar solo) in the middle of a song.  Track recording module 112 may receive an indication of a particular point in time to start recording a new track.  For example, a user may select a seek operation where a user
specifies a specific playback time to seek to, or jump to, within the track being played back.  If the existing track being played back has a track time duration of 3:35 minutes, a user may specify a specific time point (e.g., 1:24 minute) from which the
user wants to start recording a new track.  A user may use a slider bar to indicate this specific time point.  In another example, the user may play the existing track and simply wait until it reaches a specific time point.  Once that time point has been
reached, the user may start recording a new track from that point.
<br/><br/> Track recording module 112 may be configured to store the new audiovisual track recorded in media library 132.  The association between the new audiovisual track and the project in which the new audiovisual track is created may also be stored in
media library 132.
<br/><br/> Synchronization module 113 may be configured to synchronize a plurality of audiovisual tracks in a project.  In order to generate a synchronized mix of the plurality of audiovisual tracks, synchronization module 113 may specify or otherwise
update one or more track attributes and/or project attributes including metronome properties (as related to a particular audiovisual track and/or the project), project time duration, relative start and end times of audiovisual tracks that are included in
the project, pitch, key, and/or one or more identifications of the audiovisual tracks based on tracks being added to and/or deleted from the project.
<br/><br/> Because many people use a metronome to set a tempo while performing a musical instrument or singing a song, synchronization module 113 may use the metronome as a way to synchronize the plurality of audiovisual tracks in the project.  A metronome
may produce a series of audibly repetitive sounds at a certain tempo, which may be measured in beats per minute ("BPM").  In some embodiments, synchronization module 113 may be configured to specify or otherwise update metronome properties including
whether a metronome is enabled or disabled for the track, a metronome clock rate (e.g., BPM), and/or the volume and sound of the metronome.  For example, when the project has been newly created and a user records a first track for the project, the user
may specify metronome properties for the first track via synchronization module 113.  In this way, the user may record the first track at a tempo set by the metronome properties.  In another example, if the user chooses to import a first track from media
library 132 or media sharing services 140, synchronization module 113 may identify metronome properties, if any, that are associated with the imported track.
<br/><br/> The metronome properties specified and/or identified for the first track may then be associated with the project in which the first track belongs to and used to synchronize the first track with other tracks later added to the same project.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, when recording a second track in the project, synchronization module 113 may be configured to determine whether the metronome is enabled or disabled based on the metronome properties associated with the project before
starting to record the second track.  For example, if it is determined that the metronome is enabled for the project, synchronization module 113 may identify other metronome properties (e.g., metronome clock rate, the volume and sound of the metronome,
etc.) related to the project and turn on the metronome as defined by the metronome properties while recording the second track.  In this example, a user may hear the metronome at the identified clock rate in the background while recording the second
track such that the timing and tempo of the plurality of audiovisual tracks in the project may be synchronized.  In another example, if it is determined that the metronome was turned off for the project, the metronome may not be turned on for the second
track and/or any additional tracks that may be added to the project thereafter.  In other words, synchronization module 113 may disable the metronome in such a case for that project.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, when importing a second track from media library 132 or media sharing services 140, synchronization module 113 may be configured to determine whether the metronome clock rate associated with the project is the same as or
different from a metronome clock rate associated with the second track.  If the metronome clock rates are determined to be the same, the second track may be imported to the project without any modification to the second track.  On the other hand, there
may be a situation where these metronome clock rates are different.  For example, where a project has a metronome clock rate of 120 BPM associated with it, a user may want to import a second track having a 100 BPM drum beat to the project.  In this case,
synchronization module 113 may adjust the tempo of the second track by increasing the tempo from 100 BPM to 120 BPM in order to synchronize the second track with the rest of audiovisual tracks included in the project.
<br/><br/> Synchronization module 113 may be configured to edit and/or modify metronome properties after one or more audiovisual tracks have been added to the project by recording new tracks and/or importing existing tracks.  For example, a user may adjust
a metronome clock rate for the project, and all of the audiovisual track included in this project may be increased or decreased in tempo to match with the adjusted clock rate.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, synchronization module 113 may be configured to specify or otherwise update a pitch and/or key in such a manner that the resulting mix has a harmonious sound.  For example, when a project has been newly created and a user
records a first track for the project, the user may specify a pitch and/or key to be used for the first track.  The pitch and/or key information may be automatically determined by synchronization module 113 by analyzing the audio data (e.g., sound) of
the first track.  In another example, if the user chooses to import a first track from media library 132 or media sharing services 140, synchronization module 113 may identify a pitch and/or key, if any, that is associated with the imported track.
<br/><br/> The key and/or pitch information specified and/or identified for the first track may then be associated with the project in which the first track belongs to and used to synchronize (and/or harmonize) the first track with other tracks later added
to the same project.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, when adding a second track to the project by recording a second track and/or importing it from media library 132 or media sharing services 140, a synchronization module 113 may be configured to determine whether the key
and/or pitch associated with the project is the same as or different from a key and/or pitch associated with the second track.  For example, where a project has a key and pitch pair such as "C major" associated with it, a user may have recorded a second
track in a different key and pitch pair such as "D minor" or the user may want import a second track that is made in "D minor." In this case, synchronization module 113 may adjust the key or pitch (or both) of the second track to match with the ones
associated with the project in order to produce a synchronized mix that sounds harmonious and pleasing to the human ear.
<br/><br/> Whenever an additional track is added to a particular project by recording new tracks and/or importing existing tracks, synchronization module 113 may be configured to specify or otherwise update relative start and end times of the audiovisual
tracks in order to ensure that the tracks can be successfully combined as one synchronized mix.  An additional track (e.g., a new track being recorded and/or an existing track being imported) may be added at the beginning of another track in the project
or at a certain point in time in the middle of the track.  This technique may be useful, for example, when a user wants to insert a solo part (e.g., guitar solo) in the middle of a song.  For example, when a second track is layered over a first track
such that the second track begins at the same time as the first track, the start times for both of the first and second tracks may be equally denoted by 00:00.  The end times may be different if the time durations of the tracks are different.  In another
example, if the second track begins at a certain point in time (e.g., 01:30) in the middle of the first track, the first track may have a start time of 00:00 whereas the second track has a start time of 01:30.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, based on the relative start and end times of individual audiovisual tracks included in the project, synchronization module 113 may be configured to specify or otherwise update the project time duration for that particular project. 
The project time duration may indicate a total length of time from the start time of the earliest track (e.g., 00:00) to the end time of the latest track.  For example, synchronization module 113 may compare the relative end times associated with
individual tracks included in the project with one another and/or identify the latest end time.  In this example, the latest end time may be used to specify or otherwise update the project time duration for the project.
<br/><br/> Mixer module 114 may be configured to activate a "DJ Mix" mode and/or simultaneously record the changes and/or modifications made to "DJ Mix" settings associated with individual audiovisual tracks in a project while the project (e.g., the entire
collection of audiovisual tracks included in the project) is being played back (where the project may include a single or multiple audiovisual tracks).  In other words, while the project is being played back, mixer module 114 may record a user's DJ
actions that change and/or modify sequencing and/or characteristics related to one or more audiovisual tracks included in the project.
<br/><br/> In the "DJ Mix" mode, a user may specify or otherwise update one or more "DJ Mix" settings while playing the project.  "DJ Mix" settings may include deleting of a track, looping a part of a track, changing the volume of a track, muting the
volume, hiding a track, changing the tempo of a track, changing the pitch/key of a track and/or changing the position of a track on a screen.  An individual track may be associated with one or more "DJ Mix" records where each "DJ Mix" record may comprise
information related to a particular "DJ Mix" setting.
<br/><br/> For example, a "DJ Mix" record associated a particular track may include a default value of 7 for the volume.  If a user changes the volume for this track via mixer module 114 while the project is being played back, the "DJ Mix" record may be
updated to include the new value for the volume and a point in time at which the volume was changed.  The point in time may be represented as a length of time relative to the total time duration for the project (e.g., project time duration).  In another
example, a "DJ Mix" record associated with a particular track may include information related to looping.  Where the default value is "not looped," a user may change this setting by selecting to loop a part of the track during the playback of the
project.  In this example, the "DJ Mix" record may be updated to include the changed value such as "looped" and a point in time (relative to the project time duration) at which the change has occurred.  If this setting is changed again to stop the
looping at a later time during the playback of the project, the "DJ Mix" record may include another changed value (e.g., "not looped") along with a point in time at which the looping has ended.
<br/><br/> Mixer module 113 may be configured to generate a synchronized mix of one or more audiovisual tracks included in a project based on the selected options and/or changes for the "DJ Mix" settings that have been simultaneously recorded during the
playback of the project.  For example, if a user in the "DJ Mix" mode hides a particular track at 01:28 (e.g., a point in time relative to the project time duration) and later un-hide (e.g., undo the hide function) the track at 01:55 during the playback
of a project, mixer module 113 may record the user's DJ actions in real-time and generate a synchronized mix which may reflect these actions.  In this example, when this synchronized mix gets played, that particular track may disappear from the screen at
01:28 and re-appear on the screen at 01:55.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, mixer module 113 may be configured to change and/or modify "DJ Mix" settings associated with individual audiovisual tracks in a project in non-real-time.  For example, without having to play the project and simultaneously
record the changes, a user may simply select a particular track and "mute" it for the entire duration of a project or a particular subset of the duration of the project.  Mixer module 113 may also be configured to generate a synchronized mix of one or
more audiovisual tracks included in a project based on the selected options and/or changes for the "DJ Mix" settings that have been made in non-real-time.
<br/><br/> Mixer module 113 may be configured to store a synchronized mix as a new project in media library 132 and/or replace the current project from which the mix was generated with the synchronized mix in media library 132.
<br/><br/> Mixer module 113 may be configured to generate an audio file (e.g., MP3) of a synchronized mix.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, communication module 115 may be configured to communicate a synchronized mix via a user interface such that a user may listen and view the mix being played.  In some embodiments, communication module 115 may enable live
playback of the mix while an audiovisual input is being recorded.  For example, a user may listen and view the mix being played as the user records a musical performance.  In this way, the user may simulate the experience and excitement of a live jam
session.  In some embodiments, communication module 115 may be configured to share and/or publish a synchronized mix via media sharing services 140 (e.g., YouTube, Hulu, etc.), social media providers (e.g., <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, Tumblr, etc.), email, and/or
other communication channels.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, user interface module 116 may be configured to generate user interfaces that allow interaction with projects and audiovisual tracks.  For example, the user interface module may present various displays for creating projects,
recording audiovisual tracks, synchronizing the tracks, and/or mixing the tracks.
<br/><br/> Those having skill in the art will recognize that computer 110 and client device 150 may each comprise one or more processors, one or more interfaces (to various peripheral devices or components), memory, one or more storage devices, and/or
other components coupled via a bus.  The memory may comprise random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), or other memory.  The memory may store computer-executable instructions to be executed by the processor as well as data that may be
manipulated by the processor.  The storage devices may comprise floppy disks, hard disks, optical disks, tapes, or other storage devices for storing computer-executable instructions and/or data.
<br/><br/> One or more applications, including various modules, may be loaded into memory and run on an operating system of computer 110 and/or client device 150.  In one implementation, computer 110 and client device 150 may each comprise a server device,
a desktop computer, a laptop, a cell phone, a smart phone, a Personal Digital Assistant, a pocket PC, or other device.
<br/><br/> Network 102 may include any one or more of, for instance, the Internet, an intranet, a PAN (Personal Area Network), a LAN (Local Area Network), a WAN (Wide Area Network), a SAN (Storage Area Network), a MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), a
wireless network, a cellular communications network, a Public Switched Telephone Network, and/or other network.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates a process 200 of generating a synchronized mix of audiovisual tracks, according to an aspect of the invention.  The various processing operations and/or data flows depicted in FIG. 2 (and in the other drawing figures) are
described in greater detail herein.  The described operations may be accomplished using some or all of the system components described in detail above and, in some embodiments, various operations may be performed in different sequences and various
operations may be omitted.  Additional operations may be performed along with some or all of the operations shown in the depicted flow diagrams.  One or more operations may be performed simultaneously.  Accordingly, the operations as illustrated (and
described in greater detail below) are exemplary by nature and, as such, should not be viewed as limiting.
<br/><br/> In an operation 201, process 200 may include obtaining a project by creating a new project and/or retrieving an existing project from media library 132.  The project may include a first audiovisual track where the first audiovisual track may be
newly recorded in the project and/or imported from media library 132 and/or other media sharing services 140.
<br/><br/> In an operation 202, process 200 may include receiving an audiovisual input from an audiovisual capture device.
<br/><br/> In an operation 203, process 200 may include adding a second audiovisual track to the project by simultaneously recording the audiovisual input received in operation 202 while other existing tracks of the project are being played.
<br/><br/> In an operation 204, process 200 may include generating a live mix of the first and second audiovisual tracks and/or communicating the live mix via a user interface while the audiovisual input is being recorded.  For example, a user may listen
and view how the first and second tracks are combined together into a live mix as the user records the second track within the mix.
<br/><br/> In an operation 205, process 200 may include determining whether a "DJ Mix" mode is activated or not.  In the "DJ Mix" mode, a user may specify or otherwise update one or more "DJ Mix" settings while playing the project.  If process 200
determines that the "DJ Mix" mode has not been activated, process 200 may proceed to an operation 206.  In operation 206, process 200 may include generating a mix of the first and second tracks based on default values related to the "DJ Mix" settings. 
On the other hand if process 200 determines that the "DJ Mix" mode is activated, process 200 may proceed to an operation 207.
<br/><br/> In operation 207, process 200 may include playing the project including the first and second audiovisual tracks.
<br/><br/> In an operation 208, process 200 may include obtaining a modification that has been made to one or more "DJ Mix" settings while playing the project.  Process 200 may return to operation 206 where a mix of the first and second tracks is generated
based on changed settings and values related to the one or more "DJ Mix" settings.
