<br/><br/> This invention relates generally to a method, system, and/or apparatus that automatically tracks a mobile user and automatically sends messages based upon a proximity to a location or person, all using the user's mobile device.  This invention
is particularly useful in the field of social media, such as for detecting and/or tracking the location and activity of mobile users.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> Mobile devices and social media systems have permeated daily life.  Information is collected, organized, and disseminated worldwide via informational collection and dissemination, micro-blogging and blogging services.  Other social media are
mobile and positional in nature and can be referred to as Mobile Positional Social Media (MPSM).  As these systems focus on locations, mobile device implementations permeate the space.  That said, however, while MPSM implementations are targeted to
primarily execute on mobile devices, such as but not limited to smart-phones (e.g., Apple's iPhone, Google's Android), tablets (e.g., Apple's iPad, HP TouchPad), and laptop computers, they often support implementations for non-mobile environments such as
but not limited to desktops and workstations, and large scale compute farms and cloud computing servers.
<br/><br/> One limitation of MPSM systems is their reliance on global positioning systems (GPS).  The use of GPS devices does typically simplify location tracking implementation; however, this comes at a significant energy cost.  Since a significant
portion of MPSM systems usage is via mobile devices, reducing energy consumption is critical.
<br/><br/> There is therefore a continuing need for improved MPSM systems and applications, including energy saving location methods and systems, which can expand uses for MPSM and/or mobile devices.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> This invention provides a method, system, and apparatus, such as embodied in an MPSM or other software application, which creates, delivers, and displays an electronic message, such as a reminder note message, at a relevant position.  The
invention functions by desirably automatically tracking a mobile user using the user's mobile device(s), and also tracking the user's social media community through their corresponding devices.
<br/><br/> One embodiment of the invention provides a method, executed by a computer system, of delivering messages.  The method includes receiving an electronic message, e.g., including text and/or an image, created by a user through an electronic device,
storing the electronic message, automatically determining when the electronic device is at an actuating position, and automatically posting the electronic message upon determining the electronic device is at the actuating position.  The actuating
position can be any suitable location-based position, such as, without limitation, a proximity to a location or to a second electronic device.  The electronic message can be linked to the actuating position, and delivered by, for example, short message
service, e-mail, and/or a common wireless connection to the user and/or to a member of the user's community.
<br/><br/> The electronic message can be delivered to the user herself/himself on her/his mobile device (e.g., the message creating device or another mobile device of the user) or to another person's device.  In one embodiment of this invention, the method
of delivering messages includes receiving an electronic message from a user through a first electronic device of the user, automatically linking the electronic message to a message recipient, automatically determining that the user is within a
predetermined proximity to the recipient, and automatically posting the electronic message to a second electronic device of the recipient upon determining that the first electronic device is within the predetermined proximity.  The message can be
delivered by short message service, e-mail, or a common wireless connection such as Bluetooth.
<br/><br/> Ideally, mobile devices and MPSM systems should avoid reliance on GPS devices due to the energy expense.  Embodiments of this invention can incorporate a location method that relies on location information available on or through the mobile
device regardless of how or why obtained.  For example, general use of telephone features and/or other applications of the mobile device can provide location transmission or other location data for use in this invention.  By using the location
transmissions, embodiments of this invention can track and update locations without the reliance on GPS. Particular embodiments of this invention provide one or more additional location functionalities including, without limitation, automatically
identifying locations based on one or more distances from previously identified user or community locations, automatically identifying when the user is in transit and at what rate, automatically identifying when a user has arrived at the desired
destination, automatically identifying locations based on time and location of known activities, automatically refining location positioning based on time and location of known activities, automatically identifying locations based on routines, and/or
automatically refining locations positioning based on routines.
<br/><br/> The method and system of this invention are particularly useful in social media applications.  The method and system of this invention can be used to automatically determine and share a location and/or an activity of a user in an MPSM system. 
The method and system of this invention can allow for automating previously manually user-controlled MPSM.
<br/><br/> Other objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the appended claims and drawings. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> This invention includes a method, system, and/or apparatus, such as embodied in an MPSM or other software application, which automatically tracks a location of a user and automatically delivers reminders or other messages based upon determined
locations.  The invention can incorporate any suitable tracking functionality, such as GPS and/or cell phone location methods, and desirably incorporates energy saving location methods for the mobile device that can be used to more efficiently allow the
location and social media aspects of the invention to be implemented on a mobile device.  The method and application is used for automated reminders, and is particularly useful for use in social media applications.  The invention will be described below
with implementation in an MPSM system, and particularly with an MPSM application that determines and/or monitors user locations and/or context.
<br/><br/> The method and system of this invention is mobile and positional in nature.  Such systems, like many other systems originally developed on one type of computing platform but migrated to another, operate not only on mobile environments.  That is,
while MPSM implementations are targeted to primarily execute on mobile devices, such as but not limited to smart-phones, tablets, and/or laptops, they often support implementation for non-mobile environments such as but not limited to desktops and
workstations, servers, and large scale compute farms and cloud computing servers.  The invention will be described below with a mobile device, such as smart phone having cell service, a GPS system, and access to the Internet via WiFi.
<br/><br/> The invention includes a system and method for delivering messages linked to, or otherwise based upon proximity to, a location or other actuating position.  The electronic message can be any message, but is preferably a type of electronic
reminder note that a user at one location links to an actuating position which is at a different, remote location.  The actuating position can be, for example, a physical location, such as a store or an office, or a proximity to another user.  The user
is reminded and/or notified of events, numbers, activities, or any other mentionable items upon arrival at a location or upon encountering a targeted individual.  The reminder message is delivered via the user's or other recipient's mobile device.
<br/><br/> As an example, if the user had established a self-reminder to buy apples, then the device can determine from monitoring the user's location when the user is in proximity to a market or other store that likely sells apples.  The user may be at
the market or sufficiently close to a market that the user may intend to or want to shop.  If the user receives a reminder, but cannot complete the reminder at that time (such as not having time to enter the market), then the user can simply ignore or
actively reengage the reminder to remain stored and active for the next opportunity.
<br/><br/> In embodiments of this invention, an electronic message is created in an electronic device, and stored in the electronic device or a remote server, etc. A future triggering event causes the message to be delivered to the intended recipient.  The
recipient can be the user herself, and/or one or more other person, such as persons in the user's pre-established community.  In preferred embodiments of this invention, the triggering event is the proximity of the user to an actuating position, such as
a particular destination or encountering a fellow user within the user's community.  Actuating positions can be a physical location, such as but not limited to a particular address, a logical address, such as but not limited to for example, the user's
work address, proximity to a location such as, but not limited to, 500 meters from either a physical or logical address, and/or proximity to one or more users within the user's community.  The location can be a specific location, such as ABC Hardware,
and/or a general type of location, such as any hardware store.  Encountering a fellow user within the user's community can occur either when both members are near or at a preset destination--physical, logical, or proximity--or within a transmission
distance to one another independent of the identification of their physical location.
<br/><br/> The electronic message of this invention can be a single message or a sequence of messages, pictures, photographs, video clips, animations, sound waves, or combinations thereof.  These electronic reminder notes can either be plain or optionally
have a background consisting of a pattern, color, animation, sound, or a combination thereof that is either chosen by the user or is set as default.  Textual messages can be of varied fonts or sizes; pictures can either be imported or drawn or modified
on the mobile device; photographs can be imported, modified on, or taken by the mobile device; videos can be imported, modified on or taken by the mobile device; animations can be imported, modified on or produced on the mobile device; and sound waves
can be imported, produced or modified on the mobile device, or a combination thereof.  The production or modification of text messages, pictures, photographs, videos, animations, and sound waves is accomplished by any of the known approaches in the art
including but limited to the use and manipulation of clip art, enhanced photo enhancement, and voice dictation.
<br/><br/> Upon creation of the electronic message, the message is stored until deletion or delivery upon reaching the actuating position.  The electronic messages can be stored throughout their lifetime, which includes, but is not limited to, before and
after they are posted.  A history of the postings generated, received, and/or transmitted can be maintained for each user.  Such storage can be accomplished via any of the known storage structures and mediums discussed or known in the art.  Such
structures include but are not limited to file structures, database management systems, and data warehouses.
<br/><br/> Electronic reminder messages can be stored locally on the mobile device, on a remote backend storage server, or on both.  If multiple copies are stored, synchronization between remote server and mobile device can be maintain using any of the
known approaches in the art and can be updated whenever a change of status occurs or at any given time interval.  A change of status can be caused by any change identified by the mobile device including but not limited to level of energy, level or type
of activity, or location.
<br/><br/> During creation, the electronic message is desirably linked to an actuating position, either proximity to a community user or to a location.  Upon encountering the actuating position, the electronic reminder note is posted.  If the note serves
as a personal reminder, then a notification on the local device appears.  If the note is intended for a user's community member, then the note must be sent to a different device.
<br/><br/> If the message is to be sent to one or more community members and is stored locally, it can be sent from the mobile device via a text (SMS) or an e-mail message to the targeted community member's device.  Similarly, if the two devices are within
the range and allowed access of a common local network, such as but not limited to Bluetooth, then that local network can be used for device detection and/or message delivery.  If the note is stored remotely, then the user's mobile device issues a
request to the remote server, and the remote server sends a text (SMS) or an e-mail message, etc., containing the specific note to the targeted community member's device when the server receives notice that the recipient is at the actuating position.
<br/><br/> The method and system of this invention is desirably executed or implemented on a mobile device computing platform.  Such computing platforms generally include a processor, a recordable medium, an input/output (I/O) device, and a network
interface capable of connecting either directly or indirectly to the Internet.  The mobile device executes over a networked environment, such as the non-limiting example shown in FIG. 1.  The mobile device is connected, either directly or indirectly,
using any of the many techniques and technologies known in the art, over a network, to back-end system or systems, itself/themselves computing devices.  The mobile device can connect with a remote server, shown in FIG. 1 as server 38, to store and/or
access user or community information.
<br/><br/> MPSM systems are used to support users remaining socially aware of their community.  That is, their primary usage typically is to actively monitor the location and activity of family members, friends, colleagues, and generally others within
one's community.  Communities can be partitioned into sub-communities where the union of the sub-communities forms the user's community.  The sub-communities may or may not overlap.  The partitioning of communities into sub-communities is beneficial in
supporting specialized applications.
<br/><br/> The creation of a community can involve the issuing of invitations.  An invitation is a request by a user A of another user B to allow the inviting user, user A, to track the activities of the invited user, user B, and vice versa.  If the
invited user accepts, the inviting and invited users form a community.
<br/><br/> A community is relevant to only that user which formed it.  That is, different users have different communities.  A community is a grouping of invited (referred to as remote) users by the inviting (referred to as local) user.  A local user can
partition or merge a community, thus forming a sub-community or a parent community, respectively.  For example, consider 5 users: Bob, Sam, Sally, Alice, and Susan.  Bob can invite Sam, Sally, and Alice, thus forming his user community.  Bob can likewise
partition his community into a sub-community consisting of only Sam and Sally.  Sally can invite Susan.  Thus, Sally's community would include Bob (via his invitation) as well as Susan.  If no additional invites occurred, Sam's and Alice's respective
communities would only include Bob (each via Bob's invitation), while Susan's community would only include Sally (via Sally's invitation).
<br/><br/> Users are identified by their account identifier.  To use MPSM a user account is created.  User accounts generally require a user login, which is a unique user identifier, and a password or equivalent.  After having created an account, a user
can log in. Initially, the local user does not have a community.  In embodiments of this invention, over time, the method and application tracks the activities and location of the local user.  Should the local user establish a community as aforementioned
described, the community members will likewise be tracked.  Local users receive notifications of the location and activities of their community members.  Once logged in, the local user can select to activate or deactivate self and community tracking and
notification.  If not overwritten, default settings are used.  Whenever logged in and tracking is enabled, a user's location is tracked.
<br/><br/> Providing users with the opportunity to expand their communities in a convenient manner is advantageous.  Such expansion can seamlessly be accommodated by including users listed in a user's contact lists either as a whole or selectively into
their community.  Contact lists include, but are not limited to, users listed in a user's local address book, e-mail contact list, Twitter follow list, LinkedIn connections list, and/or <b><i>Facebook</i></b> friends list.  By incorporating users listed in a user's
contact list, the user's community is expanded without effort.  Note, however, that selected inclusion can be supported; thus enabling community growth without unnecessarily over-expanding the community.  That is, entries from the contact list can be
included in their entirety and the user can selectively remove those entries which s/he wishes to be excluded from the community.  Similarly, entries from the contact list can be selectively added.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 2-5 are screen shots of an application for creating electronic messages on a mobile device for sending to another person, according to embodiments of this invention.  An electronic message is first created by selecting a community member
as the target recipient or set of target recipients of the electronic message.  FIG. 2 shows a community contact list for a user.  The first 10 community members are shown in an alphabetical ordering; however, they can likewise be grouped by, but not
limited to: sub-communities, reverse alphabetical order, chronological age of the members, or any other ordering.  Note also, that each contact has a photograph icon that can be substituted with a photograph or other image.
<br/><br/> In FIG. 3, a target community member is selected, in this case, Ana.  Having selected a community member, a title for the electronic reminder message is entered.  As shown, a keyboard display is presented, and a title can be entered.  The
message can be modifiable with any desirable features.  For example, a colored background can be selected, such as shown in FIG. 4.  Other background options can exist, for example but not limited to blue, the option to insert a photograph as shown in
FIG. 5.  Options to select from previously obtained photographs or to take a photograph as background are illustrated.  The user can opt to return to the previous electronic reminder note processing stage by canceling the current request.
<br/><br/> The message can be created by typing text, as shown in FIG. 3, or can also be formed or annotated via handwriting.  In the message of FIG. 6, for example, Ben thanks Leslie in a typed message space and additionally uses a solid colored
background to inquire about her ski week by a handwritten electronic note.  Handwritten annotation can likewise be recorded using a photograph background, as shown in FIG. 7.  Similarly, annotation can be type written on an electronic reminder note
without a background, with a color background, or using a photograph background, such as shown in FIG. 8.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of this invention, a user's created message is linked to a location or a person and stored until the user, along with one of the user's mobile devices, is with a predetermined proximity to the location or an electronic device
of the intended recipient.  The user's mobile device desirably automatically determines when the device is within the proximity to the location and/or the person and, upon such a determination posts the stored message to the intended recipient.
<br/><br/> Various and alternative methods are available for the device to determine when it is within proximity to one or more locations or third party recipients.  Device functionalities such as GPS can be utilized, but reliance on GPS can undesirably
drain device battery.  In one embodiment, the device incorporates a method of determining the proximity using a combination of phone functionalities, such as discussed further below.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a representative area 30 to demonstrate a method of, and application for, locations and/or activities of a user participating in a social networking service.  The area 30 is shown as a cellular communication network including
a plurality of cells 32 each disposed around a cellular communication antennae or base station 36.  Within the area are a plurality of destinations 40-45 each shown as including a WiFi Internet connection.  The local user has one or more electronic
devices, such as a mobile device that communicates with a remote server 38 via the cellular network and/or the WiFi connections.  As will be appreciated the methods and applications of this invention can operate within any suitable size and configuration
of the communication area, depending on what the user encounters.
<br/><br/> In embodiments of this invention, at each destination 40-45, the mobile device determines the location, nearby locations, and/or any proximity to a community member.  The device can use or rely upon cell coordinates.  When mobile devices
communicate with a cell tower, they send their cell coordinates.  These coordinates are recorded by the cell provider and are typically not publicly known.  The cell phone or, in this case, the mobile device supporting the positional social media system,
however, is aware of their coordinates.  Thus, the device can determine the cell coordinate position and automatically determine from the cell coordinate a location and a proximity to any location linked to any stored message.
<br/><br/> As an example, referring to FIG. 1, destination 40 is the home of the user.  The user commutes to office 42 for work on most business days.  On the way the user typically stops at the coffee shop 41.  For lunch on most days, the user visits
restaurant 43, but on Wednesdays the user typically meets a second user for lunch at restaurant 44.  While at home 40 on a Sunday, the user enters several reminders; one for each of destinations 41, 42, and 43.  On Monday, while stopping at coffee shop
41, the user automatically receives his Sunday message to buy a bag of beans in addition to his cup of coffee.  At his office 42, he receives a message when passing the desk of a coworker to remind the coworker about an idea he had for a project (the
message could have alternatively or additionally be delivered to the coworker as well, if desired).  On Wednesday, a Sunday message for the second user, which is or includes a photograph of mutual interest, is delivered to the second user's phone upon
meeting for lunch.
<br/><br/> As will be appreciated, various and alternative messages can be create and delivered using the method and system in the above scenario.  In an embodiment of this invention, community users can set up messages linked to one or more locations for
other users.  For example, referring to FIG. 1, the user's spouse could set with her device an automated reminder on Sunday for the user to buy the coffee beans, and to be delivered upon the user reaching the shop 41.  As another example, a friend can
create a reminder on the friend's device for the user to try the sea urchin and quail egg when the user arrives at restaurant 43.  In addition, a shared list, such as a grocery or party planning list, can be set for the user and his spouse and/or friends
so that whoever arrives at a market first receives the reminder.  The reminder can be indicated as acted upon when completed so the other person doesn't duplicate the purchase.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment of this invention, the method can also operate with persons not within the user's community.  The method can operate by common identifiers such as telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, or other social media identifiers.  For
example, the user enters a conversation with a non-community acquaintance and discovers the acquaintance is soon traveling to Chicago.  The user can tell of a favorite restaurant and set up a reminder for the acquaintance based upon the acquaintance's
telephone number, social media identifier, etc., without the acquaintance needing to be added to the user's closely kept community.  The acquaintance can receive the restaurant reminder in any desired format upon the system determining or receiving
notice of the acquaintance arriving at Chicago.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment of this invention, the reminder can be automatically set by a `smart` appliance or software application having been given access to the user's system account.  For example, a WiFi-connected furnace or refrigerator could
automatically create a reminder to buy filters at a hardware store.  Alternatively, the smart appliance could send the user a real-time message to perform maintenance, and the message could contain or otherwise be linked to an option to remind the user
to buy parts when at the hardware store, according to the method and system of this invention.
<br/><br/> The system and method of this invention monitors the locations of the user and the user's community.  In one embodiment of this invention, each community member's device is determining the corresponding user's location.  The devices can
communicate the location information to a central server which determines when two or more users are within the predetermined proximity.  If a user has a message stored for delivery to another user, and these two users are determined to be in proximity,
then the stored message can be sent to the recipient.  As will be appreciated, any of various methods for determining location and proximity to another device can be incorporated by this invention.  For example, two devices can determine proximity by a
common wireless connection, such as Bluetooth or other communication platform.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, an additional and/or alternative approach for automatic location determination relies on WiFi triangulations.  Mobile devices can grow and maintain a database of known open WiFi networks, for clarity we call this database an
Open-WiFi-Net database.  Such mobile devices can use the information stored or derived from the information stored in the Open-WiFi-Net database to further refine the accuracy of a location without the use of GPS. Via point triangulation, when an
Open-WiFi-Net database is available, the mobile operating system uses not only the cell tower but also WiFi triangulations to determine location.  It is within the scope of this invention to use either or both cell-phone and WiFi triangulations to
enhance location information in addition to any other disclosed approach.  The mobile device can use the WiFi signal at a destination, such as destination 43, and additionally or alternatively any detectable open WiFi signal from a neighboring location,
such as establishment 45 that is adjacent destination 43.  In one embodiment, if the WIFI signal indicates the name and/or type of location, such as ABC Hardware, then a corresponding reminder for that location can be triggered by that information.
<br/><br/> Having created the location database, searching, namely querying, the database uses the cell coordinate or the location name.  That is, a location name query takes a location name as input and returns the corresponding cell coordinate.  A cell
coordinate query takes a location name as input and returns the corresponding location name.  Note that, multiple names can be attributed to a given cell coordinate.  That is, a local user might name a location using multiple different names; different
users can name same locations using different names.  Similarly, the same name can be used for different cell coordinate locations.  All names corresponding to a given cell coordinate are returned.  It is within the scope of this invention to selectively
return names based on context, user, or community bias.  Similarly, all cell coordinates corresponding to a given name are returned.  Again, it is within the scope of this invention to selectively return coordinates based on context, user, or community
bias.  Ranking of the results returned can, when desired, be biased towards the local user.
<br/><br/> A key concern for MPSM systems is collecting location information.  Clearly any location information available within the mobile device should be harnessed.  Thus, if GPS readings or any other location information is generated by other device
resident applications, these readings are desirably recorded and utilized by the method and application of this invention.  However, reliance on strictly other applications to obtain positional information is obviously not realistic or possible.
<br/><br/> In embodiments of this invention, positional information is obtained via the use of geofences.  A geofence is geographical boundary or "fence" surrounding a positional reading.  As these boundaries are radius based, geofences are generally
circular.  Location transmission occurs whenever a handover of one cell tower to another occurs and is expected but not guaranteed to occur once a geofence boundary is crossed.  To track location, periodic location transmissions are required.  Since
location transmissions must be minimized to conserve device energy, transmissions should only occur given geographical movement.  Thus, crossing a geofence should generate such a transmission.  Unfortunately, as crossing a geofence does not guarantee a
location transmission, increasing the likelihood of a transmission is necessary.
<br/><br/> In contrast to the known uses that surround a location with a single geofence, to increase the likelihood of a location transmission during movement, embodiments of this invention include surrounding a location geofence with a plurality of
geofences.  In one embodiment of this invention, a method of tracking a user includes determining a location of the mobile user, automatically establishing a first geofence around the location, and automatically establishing a plurality of additional
geofences around the first geofence, with each geofence including a boundary.  A location transmission is obtained by the mobile device upon crossing a boundary of the first geofence or any of the plurality of additional geofences.  Multiple neighboring
geofences are advantageous since they increase the likelihood of a location transmission as their boundaries are likewise likely to be crossed given movement.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 representatively illustrates a geofence 60 surrounding a current location 62.  The geofence 60 is surrounded by additional geofences 64, all within a given cellular tower transmissions cell 65.  Note that part of a neighboring geofence
64' is not fully within the cell 65, and hence, limits its benefits since a cell tower handoff by movement into cell 65' will generate a location transmission.
<br/><br/> Geofences are implemented as software processes.  Operating systems for mobile devices, such as but not limited to iOS and Android, limit the number of processes available to an application, and thus, the number of geofences is bounded. 
However, this limit typically exceeds the number of geofences generated using the approach described above.  Therefore, additional processes are available, and hence, additional geofences are possible.
<br/><br/> To increase the likelihood of a location transmission given movement, in embodiments of the invention, the remaining available processes implement static geofences.  A static geofence is not dynamically generated given a new location as
previously described.  Rather, a static geofence is one that is fixed and represents those locations that are likely to be crossed by a given user.  That is, users are habitual and frequent a limited set of locations often, for example but not limited
to, their home, office, or favorite wine or sushi bar.  By learning the frequent locations of users both individually and system wide and setting static geofences at these locations, biasing by the individual user, the probability of a location
transmission is increased since additional geofences are likely crossed.
<br/><br/> More so, these repeated locations vary by city, county, state, country, etc., as well as by other factors such as but not limited to day and time.  Geographical and temporal presence can thus be used to vary the set of static geofences for a
given user.  For example, the set of static geofences for a given user will vary if the user is in Washington, D.C.  rather than in San Francisco, Calif.  Similarly, the set of static geofences for a given user will vary depending on the day and time. 
For example, a user frequents work on weekday mornings but frequents their favorite bagel shop on Sunday mornings and their favorite sushi bar on Thursday evenings.
<br/><br/> Location transmissions suffer from a margin of error.  Thus, it is difficult to precisely pinpoint and tag a location with a single transmission.  Embodiments of this invention include automatic refining of a location of a user destination as a
function of user routines, such as established by several user visits to the destination.  As time progresses however, and a user frequents the same location multiple times, multiple location transmissions for the same location are recorded.  In one
embodiment of this invention, as representatively shown in FIG. 10, by overlapping the transmitted location along with its margin of error, a more accurate location can be derived.  The overlapping of location transmissions for a given location 70
between streets 72 and within geofence 74, along with their margin of errors, represented as circles 76, yields an accurate location placement.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 10, location accuracy improves as related data are collected.  Related data, however, can, at times, be somewhat erroneous (in terms of accuracy).  A non-limiting example is an entrance to a shopping mall.  Such an entrance is
not necessarily at the center of the complex.  Regardless of the entrance displacement from the center of the complex, the entrance location can still be used to increase location accuracy of the mall complex since the readings for the entrance are
consistent.  That is, for a given user, given mobile device, given carrier, etc., such location recordings remain consistent, all be it, slightly erroneous.  Thus, even dirty, namely potentially inaccurate, data can result in correct location
identification.
<br/><br/> Additionally, having established a location, corresponding lat-long pair coordinates can be reversed engineered, namely mapped back onto, a place name.  These derived lat-long pair coordinates become yet an additional information component that
is used by a learning system to better refine a mapping to a named place.  Machine learning, data mining, and statistical approaches that are supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised can be used, as known in the art, to cross-correlate all available
location related data.
<br/><br/> Once determined, the user information including the location and/or any determined user activities are automatically stored in a database.  Embodiments of this invention include a computer server for providing and implementing the tracking
and/or social networking service of this invention.  The computer server includes a location module to determine the user location and/or can optionally include a tagging module configured to correlate manually entered user information to a user
destination and a database module configured to store user information including user locations and user activities at the user locations.  For social media sharing, the server further desirably includes a communication module configured to automatically
share a user activity in the social networking service upon further user arrivals at a corresponding one of the user or community locations.  The server can also include an association module configured to associate the user activity with the
corresponding user location.
<br/><br/> Since location transmissions are needed during movement, the obvious question arises: when should the transmissions cease? That is, the system must determine when the user has arrived at a location to know when to perform the automatic steps
discussed above.  As discussed above, GPS systems are an energy drain on a mobile device, particularly as the GPS remains on and linked with the satellites to maintain location detection.  Keeping a GPS application operating is a drain on both the
processor and the battery of the mobile device.  This invention includes a method and executable application that conserves energy by not continually running during use of the mobile device.
<br/><br/> Embodiments of this invention provide an automated method of tracking a mobile user that includes providing a location module configured to receive location transmissions, placing the location module into a sleep mode, awakening the location
module upon receipt of a location transmission, and determining a location with the location module.  These placing, awakening, and determining steps are repeated, thereby placing the application into a sleep mode when not needed, thereby reducing the
drain on the mobile device.  The application goes into sleep mode when necessary or when desired, such as when the application is not needed, e.g., during extended movement or upon an arrival at a location.  In embodiments of this invention, the
application can go into sleep mode whenever a time since the device awakening exceeds a predetermined time allocation, or upon a determined rate of travel exceeding a predetermined threshold, thereby indicating extended travel.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 illustrates one exemplary, and non-limiting, method according to an embodiment of this invention to automatically detect arrival at a destination.  The method is useful for tracking a user's location for any of various reasons,
including, for example, for safety, to provide automated reminders, and/or to provide automated suggestions to the user based upon the destination and/or surrounding area.  The method of FIG. 11 is particularly useful for implementing the method and
system discussed above, and can be used to implement other applications and method to provide energy savings compared to GPS location methods in mobile devices.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 includes a flow chart 100 that includes and/or represents three distinct situations, namely, an actual arrival, rapid movement, and sporadic movement without an actual arrival.  Initially, the application is in sleep mode.  Sleep mode is
a state when no processing, and hence no energy consumption, takes place.  Processing occurs once the application is awoken.  A location transmission, such as a cell tower transmission or another application obtaining location information, awakens the
application in step 102.  Since the application awakening occurs due to a location transmission, the current location is known.
<br/><br/> Once awakened, the application typically has a maximum amount of time to complete its processing.  This limit, called time allotment, is set by the device operating system.  All processing must complete prior to exceeding the time allotment. 
Ideally, the application should relinquish the processing flag back to the device operating system before the operating system forcefully removes the application from its active queue.  Voluntarily terminating an application, namely returning it to the
sleep mode, rather than having it forcefully terminated by the host operating system, is consider good citizenship.  In step 104, the application initializes two timers, namely, a timer count representing the duration of time the process has executed
since last awakening, and a stationary count representing the duration of time since the last detected device movement.
<br/><br/> As time progresses and the process executes, the timer count is incremented in step 106.  In one embodiment of this invention, whenever the application processing time exceeds the operating system time allocation (108--YES branch), the
application is voluntarily placed in sleep mode 105.  Note that the time allocation threshold is not necessary, but set to support good citizenship.
<br/><br/> Assuming that the time limit has not been reached (108--NO branch), the application waits for t time units in step 110.  After waiting t time units, new current location data are obtained is step 112 and stored locally on the device in step 114. In step 116, the current location is compared to the previously known location.  If the two locations differ (116--NO branch), the rate of travel is computed in 118.  If the rate of travel exceeds a threshold (120--YES branch), the process is desirably
and voluntarily placed in sleep mode 122.  Rapid travel is unlikely to result in an immediate or near term arrival; thus, checking locations while moving rapidly unnecessarily uses device energy.  Eventually, the application process is awoken with the
device moving at a slower rate.  At that time, location checking is needed as an arrival might soon occur.  If or when the rate of travel is slow (120--NO branch), movement is noted in step 124, and the loop is repeated commencing with the indication
that additional processing time has elapsed in step 106.
<br/><br/> Thus far, the arrival detection process has been voluntarily placed in sleep mode either due to having exceeded the self-imposed processing allotment quota which is desirably set just slightly below the operating system's time limit that leads
to the removal of the application from the active queue (108--YES branch) or having traveled too rapidly (120--YES branch).  Slow travel has resulted in simply recording the locations traveled, noting the movement exists in step 124, and awaiting either
arrival or process termination.
<br/><br/> Arrival is determined when the same location is detected for a sufficient duration of time.  That is, an arrival is potentially determined when the location remains the same (116--YES branch).  The stationary detection count is then incremented
in step 126.  If the stationary threshold is not yet exceeded (128--NO branch), the application waits for t time units in step 110, and the current location is obtained in step 112 and stored locally in step 114.  A sufficient and predetermined duration
at the same location eventually surpass the arrival detection threshold (128--YES Branch).
<br/><br/> Once arrival is determined, arrival is declared in step 130, and all data regarding the prior locations visited and stored locally are compressed and sent to the back end system supporting the application in step 132.  A new location checkpoint
is established in step 134, and the process is placed in sleep mode 136.  From the sleep modes, the process of FIG. 11 repeats upon a known location.
<br/><br/> Compression of location data is typically performed prior to local device to back-end system transmission as often the location data many not be needed at the back end.  Location data may not be needed in cases, for example but not limited,
during rapid travel.  Although exemplified as having data compression occur prior to the sending of the data to the back-end, it is within the scope of this invention to compress location data prior to storing them locally.
<br/><br/> All parameters described above for FIG. 11, for example t (for the time units), timer count, etc., are system and device dependent.  Experimentation with and fine tuning of these and other parameters is within the scope of this invention.  Also
within the scope of this invention is the tuning of these and other parameters via the use of machine learning, data mining, and statistical approaches; supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches can be used.
<br/><br/> As discussed above, once the user has arrived at a destination, the location identification and/or any proximate third party members of the user's community are determined, if not already known.  In this way, the devices automatically
continually determine locations which can be used to identify any establishments and/or any community members at or within proximity to the location.
<br/><br/> Electronic reminder messages according to this invention provide multiple business opportunities.  Frequent request postings, for example, can be used to improve service and provide better customer satisfaction.  For example, consider a user
with severe dietary restrictions.  Such a user can post her/his restrictions as a repeated or continual electronic reminder note, i.e., one that remains active even after sending once.  Upon encountering or arriving at any location classified as a dining
establishment, the electronic reminder message can be automatically sent by the user and delivered to the dining establishment, and the dietary restriction information can then be maintained and accommodated.  This restriction information can be
permanently stored by the dining establishment or repeatedly resent by the user upon each arrival.
<br/><br/> Similarly, other desirable preferences can be sent via an electronic reminder message.  For example, but not limited to, a frequent sushi eater might have her/his favorite sushi preferences recorded; similarly, a coffee enthusiast might record
her/his favorite coffee type and style of serving.
<br/><br/> Regardless of the user motivation, be it restrictions or preference, or the type of electronic reminder message used, such notification can be encouraged and potentially rewarded by the retail establishment.  Such information can potentially
assist, for example, the dining establishment to provide a better customer experience, hence, a higher probability of generating a returning customer visit.
<br/><br/> Another business opportunity exists in the data mining of electronic reminder messages.  Pattern detection of favorite food orders or favorite wine selections can help in inventory control and special offerings as well as with marketing
strategies.  For example, if sea urchin is often requested by the very often visiting, frequent repeat diners as posted on their electronic reminder messages then a dining establishment would be wise to carry a larger supply of sea urchin than would
normally be expected.  Carrying a larger amount and potentially a variety of sea urchin would be financially logical in such cases, although, overall, sea urchin might not be that frequently purchased on a global scale.
<br/><br/> Yet an additional business opportunity is the enticement of community members of a user to visit an establishment frequented by the user.  Such enticement can be accomplished as follows.  Consider a rewards program established in a location a
user dines frequently.  Whenever, or periodically when, the user frequents this establishment, s/he is rewarded via a gift of some sort, say, without loss of generality, free coffee, drinks, or food.  Such frequency can be determined either via the
registering of electronic messages or the use of an MPSM.
<br/><br/> By maintaining electronic messages collected by community members of a particular user which were sent by the user, whenever such a community member frequents the dining establishment, they too can be awarded a gift, again, without loss of
generality, say free coffee, drinks, or food.  In fact, when awarded, optionally, the dining establishment can notify the community member that s/he is awarded this gift due to the generosity of the original user--creating good community spirit.  Such
community awareness potentially increases the likelihood that the community member will repeat visit the establishment.  Generally speaking, the likelihood that a community member will repeat visit an establishment is increased if a trusted friend
frequents that same establishment.  Succinctly, the user becomes an ambassador for the establishment to their community.  The establishment, in turn, can be charged as a service on either a fixed charge per duration or on a pay per use basis for being
informed of the visit of a community member.
<br/><br/> Yet another additional business opportunity exists in the marketing of electronic reminder messages.  Electronic reminder messages can be viewed as a form of a personalized greeting card or similarly can be viewed as an electronic business card. Opportunities exist to market customized or beautified greeting or business electronic reminder messages in a similar manner as are current business and greetings cards.  That is, customized electronic reminder messages can be sold, for example, as one
time purchases that provide either an unlimited or a limited number of uses or on a pay per use basis.
<br/><br/> Thus, the invention provides a method and system for tracking user locations without the energy consumption of GPS systems.  The invention can be implemented with social media systems for sharing reminders and messages of a user participating in
a social networking service.  The method is executed by a computer system, preferable through a mobile device, and includes automatically determining a user location, and optionally receiving user information about the location, and automatically
delivering messages corresponding to the location, either the physical location or within a proximity to another person.
<br/><br/> The invention illustratively disclosed herein suitably may be practiced in the absence of any element, part, step, component, or ingredient which is not specifically disclosed herein.
<br/><br/> While in the foregoing detailed description this invention has been described in relation to certain preferred embodiments thereof, and many details have been set forth for purposes of illustration, it will be apparent to those skilled in the
art that the invention is susceptible to additional embodiments and that certain of the details described herein can be varied considerably without departing from the basic principles of the invention.
