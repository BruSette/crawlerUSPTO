       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A system and method for predicting one or more sharing settings for a
     social network user is provided. The relevant user data is received and
     analyzed. Based on the analysis of the relevant user data, one or more of
     the user's desired sharing settings is predicted. In some embodiments,
     statistical analysis is used to analyze and/or predict the user's desired
     sharing settings. One or more predictions including a suggested sharing
     setting are generated. In one embodiment, the user's sharing settings are
     automatically adjusted based on the one or more predictions. In one
     embodiment, the one or more predictions are sent for display to the user.
     In one embodiment, feedback is obtained from the user accepting or
     rejecting the predictions. In one embodiment, the feedback is used to
     adjust one or more of the algorithms for analyzing the user data,
     predicting the user's desired sharing settings, or both.

<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Social networks are becoming an increasingly popular way for people to stay connected.  This increasing popularity of social networks has given rise to social network services that have developed various ways users of the social network can
communicate and share information.  Users within a social network can send each other messages, view other users' activities, and share personal information, including personal photographs and videos.  Social networking services can provide a forum for
users to remain in close contact despite geographic distance or uncoordinated schedules.  Further, the development of other online services that enable the general sharing of information has also increased.  Users are typically able to adjust the amount
and type of information they chose to share and how and with whom that information is shared.  However, a user may neglect to alter the default sharing settings to settings that better match the user's desire for privacy or accessibility when creating a
social network account or a user may neglect to adjust the sharing settings periodically as the user's needs and usage change.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> The deficiencies and limitations of the prior art are overcome at least in part by providing a system and method for predicting one or more of a user's desired sharing settings based on an analysis of the user's relevant data.
<br/><br/> An embodiment provides a computer-implemented method for predicting one or more sharing settings for a social network user.  The relevant user data is received and analyzed.  Based on the analysis of the relevant user data, one or more of the
user's desired sharing settings is predicted.  In some embodiments, statistical analysis is used to analyze the relevant user data and/or predict the user's desired sharing settings.  One or more predictions including a suggested sharing setting are
generated.  In one embodiment, the user's sharing settings are automatically adjusted based on the one or more predictions.  In one embodiment, the one or more predictions are sent for display to the user.  In one embodiment, feedback is obtained from
the user accepting or rejecting the predictions.  In one embodiment, the feedback is used to adjust one or more of the algorithms for analyzing the user data, predicting the user's desired sharing settings, or both.
<br/><br/> Another embodiment provides a system for predicting one or more sharing settings for a social network user.  The system includes a processor, and at least one module, stored in the memory and executed by the processor.  The module including
instructions for receiving relevant user data; analyzing the relevant user data; predicting one or more of the user's desired sharing settings based on the analysis of the relevant user data; generating one or more predictions, wherein the prediction
includes a suggestion of a desired sharing setting; and, depending on the embodiment, either sending the one or more predictions for display, or automatically adjusting the user's sharing settings according to the one or more predictions.  In one
embodiment, instructions for obtaining feedback when the user accepts or rejects the predictions are included.  In one embodiment, instructions for using the feedback to adjust one or more of the algorithms for analyzing the user data, predicting the
user's desired sharing settings, or both are included.
<br/><br/> Yet another embodiment provides a graphical user interface for predicting one or more sharing settings for a user.  The graphical user interface displays the one or more predictions, wherein the prediction includes a suggestion of at least one
desired sharing setting.  In one embodiment, the graphical user interface also displays the user's current sharing setting for each of the predictions.  In one embodiment, the graphical user interface is displayed as a portion of a user's social network
webpage.  In another embodiment, the graphical user interface is displayed as a pop-up window. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/> System Overview
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of a social network system 100 for predicting one or more of a user's desired sharing settings based on an analysis of the user's relevant data according to one embodiment.  In some embodiments, the sharing
settings are the settings within a user's social network that controls who sees what information on that user's social network.  For example, if a user sets his or her sharing settings to all the information being public, then everyone will be able to
view that user's information.  In some embodiments, users can set the sharing settings to allow certain users to view some information and allow other users to view other information on the user's social network.
<br/><br/> The illustrated embodiment of the social network system 100 for predicting one or more of a user's desired sharing settings based on an analysis of the user's relevant data includes user devices 115a, 115b, 115n that are accessed by users 125a,
125b, 125n, a social network server 101 and a third party server 107.  The system 100 also includes user application servers 130a, 130b.  In the illustrated embodiment, these entities are communicatively coupled via a network 105.  Although only three
devices are illustrated, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any number of user devices 115n are available to any number of users 125n.  Further, although only two user application servers 130a, 130b are illustrated, persons of
ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any number of user application servers 130n are available.
<br/><br/> The user devices 115a, 115b, 115n and user application servers 130a, 130b in FIG. 1 are used by way of example.  While FIG. 1 illustrates two devices, the embodiment applies to any system architecture having one or more user devices and one or
more user application servers.  Furthermore, while only one network 105 is coupled to the user devices, 115a, 115b, 115n, the social network server 101 and the third party server 107, in practice any number of networks 105 can be connected to the
entities.  Furthermore, while only one third party application server 107 is shown, the system 100 could include one or more third party application servers 107.
<br/><br/> The social network server 101 also contains a social network module 209.  Although only one social network server 101 is shown, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that multiple servers may be present.  A social network is any
type of social structure where the users are connected by a common feature.  Examples include, but are not limited to, Orkut, Buzz, blogs, microblogs, and Internet forums.  The common feature includes friendship, family, a common interest, etc. The
common feature includes friendship, family, work, an interest, etc.
<br/><br/> The network 105 enables communications between user devices 115a, 115b, 115n, and 115n, the social network server 101, the third party application 107 and user application servers 130a, 130b, and 130n.  Thus, the network 105 can include links

Advanced Switching, etc. Similarly, the networking protocols used on the network 105 can include the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), multi-protocol label switching (MPLS), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the hypertext
transport protocol (HTTP), the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), the file transfer protocol (FTP), lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), Global System for
Mobile communications (GSM), High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), etc. The data exchanged over the network 105 can be represented using technologies and/or formats including the hypertext markup language (HTML), the extensible markup language
(XML), etc. In addition, all or some of links can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as the secure sockets layer (SSL), Secure HTTP and/or virtual private networks (VPNs) or Internet Protocol security (IPsec).  In another
embodiment, the entities can use custom and/or dedicated data communications technologies instead of, or in addition to, the ones described above.  Depending upon the embodiment, the network 105 can also include links to other networks.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the network 105 is a partially public or a wholly public network such as the Internet.  The network 105 can also be a private network or include one or more distinct or logical private networks (e.g., virtual private networks,
Wide Area Networks ("WAN") and/or Local Area Networks ("LAN")).  Additionally, the communication links to and from the network 105 can be wireline or wireless (i.e., terrestrial- or satellite-based transceivers).  In one embodiment, the network 105 is an
IP-based wide or metropolitan area network.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the network 105 helps to form a set of online relationships between users 125a, 125b, and 125n, such as provided by one or more social networking systems, such as social network system 100, including explicitly-defined
relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users, where the relationships form a social graph.  In some examples, the social graph can reflect a mapping of these users and how they are related.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a sharing settings prediction module 220a is included in the social network server 101 is operable on the social network server 101.  In another embodiment, the sharing settings prediction module 220b is included in the third

Moreover, this description occasionally omits the term "module" for purposes of clarity and convenience.
<br/><br/> Sharing Settings Prediction Module 220
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 3, the sharing setting prediction module 220a is shown in more detail.  In another embodiment, the third party application server 107 includes the sharing settings module 220b.  In one embodiment, the sharing settings
module 220a is software and routines executable by the processor 206 to predict one or more of a user's desired sharing settings based on an analysis of the user's relevant data.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the sharing settings module 220a comprises a relevant data retrieval engine 302, and a sharing settings prediction engine 304, an optional prediction notification engine 306, an optional algorithm adjustment engine 308, and an
optional settings adjuster engine 310.
<br/><br/> The relevant data retrieval engine 302 is software and routines executable by the processor for receiving relevant data and sending the relevant data to the sharing settings prediction engine 304.  Relevant data is data that is received by the
relevant data retrieval engine 302 for analysis by the sharing settings prediction engine 304 discussed below.  In one embodiment, the relevant data retrieval engine 302 is a set of instructions executable by a processor to provide the functionality
described below for receiving relevant data.  In another embodiment, the relevant data retrieval engine 302 is stored in memory of the social network server 101 and is accessible and executable by the processor.  In either embodiment, the relevant data
retrieval engine 302 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor and other components of the social network server 101.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, the relevant data retrieval engine 302 is communicatively coupled to the storage device 214.  The relevant data retrieval engine 302 is also communicatively coupled, via the sharing settings prediction module 220a of
the social network server 101 to user application servers 130a, 130b, and 130n.  In one embodiment, the relevant data retrieval engine 302 receives data from the user application servers 130a, 130b, and 130n.  According to one embodiment, the relevant
data retrieval engine 302 is communicatively coupled, via the sharing settings prediction module 220a of the social network server 101 to the data store 110.  In one embodiment, the relevant data retrieval engine 302 receives data from the data store
110.  In some embodiments, data is received from other applications, such as data stored in user application servers 130a/130b/130n.  In some embodiments, the other applications are other social network servers.  In such embodiments, examples of data
received includes, but is not limited to, user sharing data including frequency of use of the application and the scope of communication within the applications or social network servers.
<br/><br/> The sharing settings prediction engine 304 is software and routines executable by the processor for analyzing the received relevant data and predicting one or more of the user's desired sharing settings based an analysis of that relevant data. 
In one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 is a set of instructions executable by a processor to provide the functionality described below for analyzing relevant data and predicting one or more of the user's desired sharing settings
based on that relevant data.  In another embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 is stored in the memory 208 of the social network server 101 and is accessible and executable by the processor 206.  In either embodiment, the sharing
settings prediction engine 304 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor and other components of the social network server 101.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, sharing settings are embodied in levels.  Each level corresponds to various sharing settings for an attribute.  According to one embodiment, an attribute is a type of information in an application associated with a user of the
social network system 100.  For example, an attribute may be a type of information in an application to be displayed to other within the social network system 100, such as the user's name.  As another example, another feature is the user's profile
picture.  Another example of an attribute is the user's address.  An attribute may also be sharing setting of a user of the social network system 100.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, the sharing settings are divided into three levels which are low, medium, and high.  A low level applies permissive sharing settings to the feature making all or most of the information contained in the feature
available to all the users of the system 100.  A medium level applies moderate sharing settings to the feature making the information contained in the feature available to direct connections of the user.  A high level applies stringent sharing settings
to the feature and makes the information contained in the feature available to only the user.  The foregoing is an example of how sharing setting levels correlate with access to information associated with an attribute.  Other embodiments can include
different and or additional protection levels and different associated sharing settings.  As described in this embodiment, three levels of sharing protection are shown.  However, in other embodiments, there can be any number of sharing protection levels.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 utilizes one or more algorithms to analyze the relevant data.  In one such embodiment, one or more algorithms are based on common sense assumptions about sharing settings preference
in regards to one or more user characteristics.  For example, if the user is a girl in her early teens whose photographs are frequently accessed by much older men that are not friends of the girl, in one embodiment, a common sense assumption is that such
access is undesirable.  In one such embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts that the user desires a sharing setting other than a low-level setting for features associated with photograph sharing in order to prohibit such access.
<br/><br/> In another such embodiment, one or more of the algorithms utilize aggregate statistics, which can demonstrate one or more themes in a population based on the presence of a certain characteristic or set of characteristics.  For example, a
fictional aggregate statistic is that 70% of married social network users over age 50 share their photographs only with their friends and family.  In the example, the theme is photograph sharing; the population is social network users; and the set of
characteristics is married and over 50 years of age.  In the example, in one embodiment, if the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzed the user's data and found that the user was over 50 years of age and married the sharing settings prediction
engine 304 predicts that the user desires medium-level sharing protection.  In one embodiment, the aggregate statistics are generated at least in part by a statistical analysis of the users and user accounts of the social network system 100.
<br/><br/> In yet another such embodiment, one or more algorithms used by the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyze the relevant data using statistical weighting, which can emphasize, or diminish, the effect of a variable on the result of the
algorithm.  For example, in one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes the user's sharing settings for other sites and applications, and the user's demographic.  In this example, the user's sharing settings for all the other
sites and applications are the default sharing setting for those sites and applications.  In one embodiment, the usefulness of these default sharing settings in predicting one or more of the desired sharing settings is inconclusive.  The default sharing
settings may represent the settings the user actually desires or they may be the result of the user neglecting to personalize the sharing settings.  In this example, in one embodiment, the algorithm used by the sharing settings prediction engine 304
gives less statistical weight to the user's sharing settings for other sites and applications because of their inconclusive usefulness for predicting one or more of the user's desired sharing settings.  Therefore, more statistical weight is assigned to
the user's demographics thereby predicting the user's desired sharing settings predominantly based on the user's demographic in accordance with one embodiment.  In one embodiment, one or more of the algorithms can be modified by user feedback described
below.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes and predicts one or more of the user's desired sharing settings based on relevant data associated with the user's sharing settings on other websites and
applications.  In one such embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes the user's other sharing settings for the presence and the nature of consistencies then predicts one or more of the user's desired sharing settings based on that
analysis.  For example, in one embodiment, if the analysis reveals the user's other sites and applications exhibit predominantly high-level sharing settings, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts that the user desires high-level settings on
the social network 101.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes the user's relevant data and predicts one or more of the user's desired sharing settings based on relevant data associated with the user's online usage.  Online
usage includes, but is not limited to, the posting, tagging, blogging, micro-blogging and other sharing by the user whether on the social network 100 or on another site or application.  In one such embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304
analyzes the user's online usage for frequency, content, and scope of the user's sharing.  For example, in one embodiment, if analysis reveals the user regularly maintains a public blog under the user's actual name, the sharing settings prediction engine
304 predicts that the user desires low-level sharing settings, because there is high frequency, the blog contains the user's actual information (name), and the blog is publicly accessible.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes and predicts one or more of the user's desired sharing settings based on relevant data associated with the sharing settings of one or more of the user's contacts on
the social network.  In one such embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes the sharing settings of one or more of the user's contacts for consistencies and the nature of those consistencies.  For example, in one embodiment, if the
user's contacts predominantly use high-level sharing settings, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts that the user desires high-level sharing settings.  In one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes the user's close
contact, or contacts.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes and predicts one or more of the user's desired sharing settings based on relevant data regarding the user's demographic.  In one embodiment, the user's demographic
includes information about the user's age, which is submitted by the user.  For example, in one embodiment, if aggregate statistics indicate that users in their late teens or early twenties prefer low-level sharing settings, the sharing settings
prediction engine 304 predicts that a twenty year-old user desires low-level sharing settings.  In another embodiment, the user's demographic information includes the user's gender, which is submitted by the user.  For example, in one embodiment, if
aggregate statistics indicate that male users prefer low-level sharing settings, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts that a male user desires low-level sharing settings.  In another embodiment, the user's demographic information includes
the user's education, which is submitted by the user.  For example, in one embodiment, if aggregate statistics indicate that users with post graduate degrees desire high-level sharing settings, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts that a
user with a post grad degree desires high-level sharing settings.  In another embodiment, the user's demographic information includes the user's profession, which is submitted by the user.  For example, in one embodiment, if aggregate statistics indicate
that users in the hospitality industry desire medium-level sharing settings, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts that a user who works as a tour guide desires medium-level sharing settings.  In another embodiment, the user's demographic
information includes the user's relationship status, which is submitted by the user.  For example, in one embodiment, if aggregate statistics indicate that married users desire medium-level sharing settings, the sharing settings prediction engine 304
predicts that a married user desires medium-level sharing settings.  In another embodiment, the user's demographic information includes the user's geographic location.  For example, in one embodiment, if aggregate statistics indicate that users in New
England desire low-level sharing settings, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts that a user in Massachusetts desires low-level sharing settings.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes and predicts one or more of the user's desired sharing settings based on relevant data regarding the user's characteristics.  In one embodiment, the user's
characteristics data is the results of a quiz or questionnaire the user answers.  For example, in one embodiment, if common sense indicates that users identified by a quiz as extraverted does not desire high-level sharing settings, the sharing settings
prediction engine 304 predicts that a user who takes the quiz and is identified as extraverted desires sharing settings other than high-level.  In another embodiment, the characteristics data is the results of a puzzle or game the user played, which
provides insight into the user's characteristics.  For example, a person who plays Sudoku may be introverted and perhaps prefer higher-level sharing settings.  It should be noted that personality traits are just one of many user characteristics that can
be inferred.  For example, in one embodiment, the user's acceptance of technology may be inferred.  If a user discloses on a quiz, for example, that the user has many online accounts and spends many hours a day online or on a social network site, it may
be inferred that the user is comfortable with sharing information online and prefers lower-level sharing settings.  In another embodiment, characteristics data is associated with the user's e-mail and calendar and the user's interaction preferences are
inferred.  For example, in one embodiment, a user who corresponds by e-mail frequently, but does not have many meetings or face-to-face appointments in his or her calendar the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts that the user desires
low-level sharing settings, since the user's preferred method of interaction is electronic.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes and predicts one or more of the user's desired sharing settings based on relevant data regarding other users or applications accessing the user's features.  For
example, in one embodiment, if it is a common sense assumption that users whose features are frequently accessed by applications other than the applications the users use desire medium-level sharing settings which prohibits such use, the sharing settings
prediction engine 304 predicts that the user desires medium-level sharing settings.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts one or more of the user's desired sharing settings by selection.  For example, in one such embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts that a married,
sixty-year-old lawyer desires high-level sharing protection.  In another embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts one or more of the user's desired sharing settings by elimination.  For example, in one such embodiment, the sharing
settings prediction engine 304 predicts that a married, sixty-year-old lawyer does not desire low-level sharing protection.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts the user's desired sharing setting for each individual feature.  For example, in one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes the user's
relevant data and predicts that the user desires a low-level sharing setting for the user's profile picture, a medium-level sharing setting for the user's posts, a high-level sharing setting for the user's address, a low-level sharing setting for the
user's e-mail address, and a high-level sharing setting for the user's photographs.  In another embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts the user's desired sharing setting based on groups of features.  For example, in one
embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes the same user's relevant data and predicts, perhaps utilizing statistical weighting, that the user desires medium-level sharing settings for features associated with biographical information
or posts and high-level sharing settings for features associated with photographs.  In another embodiment, a plurality of user categories is defined based on user characteristics.  Each user category is associated with the sharing settings predicted to
be desired by a user fitting that user category.  In one such embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes the user's relevant data and categorizes the user, which predicts the user's desired sharing settings are those associated with
that user category.
<br/><br/> Some embodiments of the sharing settings prediction module 220 also include a prediction notification engine 306.  The prediction notification engine 306 is software and routines executable by the processor for notifying the user of the sharing
settings prediction engine's 304 one or more predicted sharing settings.  In one embodiment, the prediction notification engine 306 is a set of instructions executable by a processor to provide the functionality described below for notifying the user of
the sharing settings prediction engine's 304 one or more predicted sharing settings.  In another embodiment, the prediction notification engine 306 is stored in memory of the social network server 101 and is accessible and executable by the processor. 
In either embodiment, the prediction notification engine 306 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor and other components of the social network server 101.
<br/><br/> The prediction notification engine 306 receives the predicted sharing settings from the sharing settings prediction engine 304, generates a prediction including a suggestion for a desired sharing setting, and sends the prediction for display to
the user.  In one embodiment, the prediction is displayed as a pop-up.  In another embodiment, the prediction is an e-mail or message to the user.  In one embodiment, the prediction is displayed on the page where sharing settings are normally set or
displayed.  In yet another embodiment, the prediction is another webpage.  Other embodiments may use other forms of display.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the prediction notification engine 306 compares the user's predicted sharing settings to the user's current sharing settings.  In one embodiment, the prediction notification engine 306 generates a prediction only if one or
more of the user's current sharing settings differ from the sharing setting predicted by the sharing settings prediction engine 304.  In one embodiment, the prediction notifies the user specifically which feature, or features, have sharing settings
different from those predicted by the sharing settings prediction engine 304.  In one embodiment, the prediction includes the one or more sharing settings predicted by the sharing settings prediction engine 304 as suggestions for desired sharing
settings.  In one such embodiment, the prediction includes suggestions for desired sharing settings only for the sharing settings where the user's current setting differs from the predicted setting.  In one embodiment, the prediction notification engine
306 notifies the user why, or based on what relevant data, one or more of the predicted sharing settings is based on.  For example, in one embodiment, the notification could read "It is recommended that you change the sharing settings for your
biographical information from low to medium due to repeated access by third-party applications."
<br/><br/> Some embodiments of the sharing settings prediction module 220 also include an algorithm adjustment engine 308.  The algorithm adjustment engine 308 is software and routines executable by the processor for changing one or more of the algorithms
used by the sharing settings prediction engine 304 based on user feedback.  In one embodiment, the algorithm adjustment engine 308 is a set of instructions executable by a processor to provide the functionality described below for changing one or more of
the algorithms used by the sharing settings prediction engine 304 based on user feedback.  In another embodiment, the algorithm adjustment engine 308 is stored in memory of the social network server 101 and is accessible and executable by the processor. 
In either embodiment, the algorithm adjustment engine 308 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor and other components of the social network server 101.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, user feedback is obtained when the user rejects one or more of the predicted sharing settings by either declining to accept the predicted sharing setting, or changing the sharing setting from the predicted sharing setting.  In
one embodiment, the rejection of one or more predicted sharing settings is feedback in and of itself.  In one embodiment, the feedback is the user's response, or responses, to one or more questions submitted to the user regarding the reason, or reasons,
the user prefers a non-predicted sharing setting.  In one embodiment, the user's feedback adjusts one or more aggregate statistics used in one or more algorithms.  In one embodiment, the user's feedback adjusts one or more statistical weighting factors
used in one or more algorithms.
<br/><br/> The settings adjuster engine 310 is software and routines executable by the processor for adjusting the user's sharing settings to the settings predicted by the sharing settings prediction engine 304.  In one embodiment, the settings adjuster
engine 310 is a set of instructions executable by a processor to provide the functionality described below for adjusting the user's sharing settings to the settings predicted by the sharing settings prediction engine 304.  In another embodiment, the
settings adjuster engine 310 is stored in memory of the social network server 101 and is accessible and executable by the processor.  In either embodiment, the settings adjuster engine 310 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor
and other components of the social network server 101.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the settings adjuster engine 310 receives the predicted sharing settings from the sharing settings prediction engine 304 and adjusts the user's sharing settings to the predicted sharing settings.  In another embodiment, the
settings adjuster engine 310 receives the predicted sharing settings from the prediction notification engine 306 and adjusts the user's sharing settings to the predicted sharing settings.  In one embodiment, for any adjustments to occur the user must
accept one or more of the predicted sharing settings and only the sharing settings for the accepted predicted sharing settings are adjusted.  In another embodiment, the user's sharing settings are automatically adjusted to the predicted sharing settings
without user action or approval.  In one embodiment, the user's sharing settings are only automatically adjusted to the predicted sharing settings without user action, or approval, if the predicted sharing setting is more stringent than the user's
current sharing setting.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 illustrates an example of a storage device 214 storing user aggregate statistics 800 data and user data 802 including data belonging to User-A 810a according to one embodiment.  In this example, the User-A data 810a includes data
regarding User-A's demographic 820a and User-A's sharing settings 820b.  In one embodiment, User-A's demographic data 820a includes user submitted information regarding User-A's age 830a, gender 830b, profession 830c, and other demographic information
830n.  The user aggregate statistics data 800 includes statistics data regarding the users of the social network system 100 including user demographic statistics 840a, user sharing settings statistics 840b, and other statistics data 840n according to one
embodiment.  In this example, the sharing settings statistics data 840b contains statistical data regarding user sharing settings by age 850a, gender 850b, profession 850c, and other sharing settings statistics.  In one embodiment, the sharing settings
prediction engine 304 analyzes the User A's demographic data 820a and predicts User A's desired sharing settings using algorithms involving aggregate statistics data for users sharing settings 840b.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, the user may opt in/out of participating in such data collection activities.  Furthermore, the collected data can be anonymized prior to performing the analysis to obtain the various statistical patterns described above.
<br/><br/> As mentioned above, in one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction module 220c is included in the user application server 130a/130b/130n and is operable on the user application server 130a/130b/130n.
<br/><br/> Method
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 4, a flow chart illustrating an embodiment of a method 400 for predicting one or more of a user's desired sharing settings based on an analysis of the user's relevant data is shown.
<br/><br/> The relevant data retrieval engine 302 of the sharing settings prediction module 220a obtains the relevant data 402.  As discussed above, relevant data is data used to predict one or more of the user's desired sharing settings and includes, but
is not limited to, data regarding the user's sharing settings for other sights and applications, the user's contacts' sharing settings, sharing setting of similar users, user's demographic information, user's online usage, user's characteristics, and
data regarding which other users are accessing which of the user's features.  The sharing settings prediction engine 304 receives the relevant data from the relevant data retrieval engine 302.  The sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes the
relevant data and predicts one or more of the user's desired sharing settings 404 based on the analysis of that relevant data.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 5, a flow chart illustrating a method 500 for analyzing the user's relevant data and predicting one or more of the user's desired sharing settings is shown in accordance with one embodiment.  It will be clear to a person
having ordinary skill in the art that this is just one embodiment.  Other embodiments may use any of the analysis methods in FIG. 5 alone or in combination.  Other embodiments may also include analysis methods in addition to or different from those of
FIG. 5.  The sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes the user's sharing settings for other sites and applications 502.  In one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 then analyzes the user's online usage 504.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 6, a flow chart illustrating a method 600 for analyzing the user's online usage is shown in accordance with one embodiment.  The sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes the features, applications, and websites the
user uses 602 according to one embodiment.  For example, if the user has a blog or micro-blog 604(Yes), the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes the user's blogging data 606 including interactions with the blogging data (e.g., editing,
commenting, reposting and sharing).  In one embodiment, once the blogging data are analyzed 606, or if the user does not blog or micro-blog 604(No), the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes whether the user shares features 608.  If the user
tags photos, posts messages, or otherwise shares features 608(Yes), the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes how frequently the user shares features 610, what features the user is sharing 612, and who the user shares these features with 614
according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> Referring again to FIG. 5, in one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 analyzes the sharing settings of the user's contacts 506.  The sharing settings prediction engine 304 then analyzes sharing settings of similar users 507. 
In such embodiments, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 determines similarity of users based on information about the users, for example, information related to user demographics, sharing usage, and social network activity.  The sharing settings
prediction engine 304 then analyzes the user's demographic 508 according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 7, a flow chart illustrating a method 700 for analyzing the user's demographic is shown in accordance with one embodiment.  It will be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art that this is just one embodiment. 
Other embodiments may use any of the analysis methods in FIG. 7 alone or in combination.  Other embodiments may also include analysis methods in addition to or different from those of FIG. 7.  According to one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction
engine 304 analyzes the user's age 702, gender 704, education 706, profession 708, relationship status 710, and geographic location 712.
<br/><br/> Referring again to FIG. 5, the sharing settings prediction engine 304, according to one embodiment, then analyzes the user's characteristics 510.  As discussed above, the user's characteristics can be analyzed any number of ways, including, but
not limited to, questionnaires, puzzles, or games or application and website usage.  The sharing settings prediction engine 304 then analyzes what other users and applications are accessing the user's features and which features they are accessing 512
according to one embodiment.  According to one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts one or more of the user's desired sharing settings 514 based on the foregoing analysis.  As discussed above, in some embodiments, the sharing
settings prediction engine 304 predicts the user's one or more desired sharing settings using one or more algorithms (not shown).  In one embodiment, one or more algorithms rely on aggregate statistics.  In one embodiment, one or more algorithms use
statistical weighting.  In one embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts one or more of the user's desired sharing settings by selection.  In another embodiment, the sharing settings prediction engine 304 predicts one or more of the
user's desired sharing settings by elimination.
<br/><br/> Referring again to FIG. 4, according to some embodiments, the method includes generating 406 a prediction including a suggestion for a desired sharing setting, and sending 408 the prediction for display to the user.  The prediction notification
engine 306 notifies the user of the sharing settings predicted 404 by the sharing settings prediction engine 304.  As mentioned above, the prediction can be displayed in any number of places including, but not limited to, an e-mail, a pop-up, a separate
webpage, or where the sharing settings are typically set or displayed.  The prediction can include various amount of detail including, but not limited to, whether any of the user's sharing settings differ from those predicted 404, one or more of the
user's current settings, one or more of the user's predicted 404 sharing settings, how the user can accept or adjust the sharing settings, if the sharing settings have already been adjusted, and on what basis one or more predictions 404 were made.  In
one embodiment the predicted 404 sharing settings are the suggested sharing settings in the generated 406 prediction.  In one embodiment, the user's sharing settings are automatically adjusted (not shown) based on the generated 406 prediction rather than
sending 408 the prediction for display.  According to one embodiment, the user is given the option to accept or reject one or more of the suggested desired sharing settings 410.
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, if one or more of the predicted sharing settings is rejected 410 (Yes), one or more of the algorithms used by the sharing settings prediction engine 304 are adjusted 414 based on the user's feedback.  As discussed
above, the user's feedback can include the rejection of the predicted sharing setting alone, or can include additional information, such as the user's response to questions regarding the user's preference for a non-predicted sharing setting.  In some
embodiments, the statistical weighting factors in the algorithms are adjusted based on the feedback.  In some embodiments, the aggregate statistics used by the algorithm are adjusted based on the feedback.  In some embodiments, after adjusting 414 one or
more of the algorithms the user's relevant data is analyzed and the users desired sharing settings are predicted 404 again using the adjusted algorithms.  In one embodiment, the cycle of analyzing user's relevant data and predicting the user's desired
sharing settings 404, generating a prediction 406, sending the prediction for display 408, and adjusting 414 the algorithms is repeated until the user accepts one or more of the predicted sharing settings 410 (No).
<br/><br/> According to some embodiments, the method includes adjusting one or more of the user's sharing settings 412 to one or more of the predicted sharing settings.  The settings adjuster engine 308 adjusts one or more of the user's sharing settings
410 to one or more of the sharing settings predicted 404 by the sharing settings prediction engine 304 and suggested in the generated 406 prediction.  As mentioned above, in one embodiment, the settings adjuster engine 310 automatically adjusts the
user's sharing settings 412 to those predicted by the sharing settings prediction engine 304 without user action or permission.  In some such embodiments, the sharing settings are only adjusted 412 if the predicted sharing settings are more stringent
than the user's current sharing settings.  In one embodiment, the user must accept 410(No) one or more of the predicted sharing settings and only the predicted sharing settings accepted 410(No) by the user are adjusted 412.
<br/><br/> Graphical User Interface
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a graphic representation of an example of a user interface 900 displaying a user's social networking page 902.  In one embodiment, the user's sharing settings 904 are normally displayed under the sharing settings tab of user options. 
In one embodiment, the sharing settings 904 include a table displaying the features 906, the user's current sharing setting associated with each feature 908, and the predicted sharing settings 910 for each feature.  According to one embodiment, the user
is notified when a user's sharing setting differs from the predicted sharing settings.  In one embodiment, this notification is visual.  For example, highlighting 912 one or more features 906 whose current setting 908 differs from the predicted setting
910.  In one embodiment, the user must choose to accept the predicted sharing preference 910 before the user's current setting 908 is adjusted to match.  In one embodiment, the predicted sharing settings can be accepted or rejected for each feature
individually.  In one embodiment, acceptance or rejection of the predicted sharing settings is done in the same location as the notification of the predicted sharing settings 904.  In one embodiment, the acceptance is done by clicking on a button 914. 
Acceptance of the predicted sharing setting automatically adjusts the user's current sharing setting 908 to the predicted sharing setting 910 according to one embodiment.
<br/><br/> The foregoing description of the embodiments has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.  It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the embodiments to the precise form disclosed.  Many modifications and variations
are possible in light of the above teaching.  It is intended that the scope of the embodiments be limited not by this detailed description, but rather by the claims of this application.  As will be understood by those familiar with the art, the
embodiments may take other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof.  Likewise, the particular naming and division of the modules, routines, features, attributes, methodologies and other aspects are not
