       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> Linking data items describing a person into a single, unified contact
     entry without merging the data items. The data items include, for
     example, contact data, social network data, and other data describing the
     person. The contact entry is a single representation of the person that,
     in some embodiments, combines a plurality of personas of the person
     without merging the underlying data items. Metadata representing one or
     more contact entries is capable of being shared across a plurality of
     devices and applications such that a user is presented with a consistent
     contact list on different devices and from within different applications.
     In some embodiments, the user annotates one or more of the contact
     entries with notes or other data that is stored with the metadata.

<br/><br/> Many users have contact data stored in multiple different data sources.  For example, a typical user may have contact data for work-related colleagues stored in a work email system, contact data for classmates stored in a school-provided
computing system, and contact data for social acquaintances stored with several different social networking websites.  The same person may have different contact data in several of the data sources.  For example, a work telephone number for a user may be
stored in contact data in the work email system, a school email address for the same user may be stored in contact data in the school-provided computing system, and a mobile telephone number for the same user may be stored in contact data in a social
networking website.  With contact data stored in the multiple different data sources, users have difficulty identifying which of the data areas stores particular contact data.  For example, a user may have to search through several different data areas
to find the email address of another user.
<br/><br/> Some existing systems allow users to merge the contact information from the different data areas by copying the contact information into a new contact entry for each user and deleting duplicate information.  With these existing systems, however,
the users manually select and identify the contact data for merging.  Further, because the contact data is copied into the new contact entry, the users have to manually update the new contact entry when changes are made to the original contact data in
each of the data areas.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the disclosure link data items for a person to create contact entries representing aggregated data.  Data sources available from a computing device of a device user are accessed.  The data sources provide data items associated
with a plurality of users.  The data items provided by each of the accessed data sources are searched to identify groups of the data items.  Each of the groups is associated with one of the plurality of users.  Each of the identified groups is analyzed
to identify false-positive data items within each of the identified groups.  The identified false-positive data items are removed from the groups.  Without seeking approval from the device user after identifying the groups of the data items and without
modifying the data items stored by the data sources, one contact entry for each of the plurality of users associated with one of the groups is created.  Each of the contact entries provides the data items associated with one of the groups.  The created
contact entries are provided to the device user.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Referring to the figures, embodiments of the disclosure enable data from separate sources to be automatically linked to a single contact entry 110 (e.g., without merging the underlying data).  In some embodiments, a device user 102 of a
computing device 104 (e.g., a mobile telephone) identifies data items 302 including contact entries, data within the contact entries, social content data, and other data items describing people (e.g., other users).  Aspects of the disclosure search the
data items 302 to create groups of data items 302 without modifying the data items 302 as stored by the sources.  Each of the groups is considered to be a single contact entry 110, and each is associated with one of the users.  False-positive operations
are performed to minimize erroneous groupings.  Each of the groups includes metadata defining links 112 or references to the underlying data items 302.  In some embodiments, the metadata is available to the applications executing on the computing device
104 such that the device user 102 is presented with unified, consistent contact entries 110 across the applications.
<br/><br/> Aspects of the disclosure represent each of the linked contact entries 110 (e.g., group) with a single name and picture.  The device user 102 may identify preferences for revising the contact name and picture selected by aspects of the
disclosure from the data items 302 linked to the single contact entry 110.  For example, the picture may be selected in one or more of the following ways: the picture most recently updated is selected, the picture is explicitly selected by the device
user 102, the picture is selected from a social networking website from which a status update was last posted, the picture is selected from the social networking website having the most recently updated picture, and the picture is selected from other
accounts available on the computing device 104 (e.g., selected in the order in which the accounts were added).
<br/><br/> Each of the groups of linked contact entries 110 includes metadata representing data from multiple sources 124.  The data from the multiple sources 124 includes, in some embodiments, one or more of the following: contact name, picture,
communication methods (e.g., telephone, electronic mail address, etc.) and social content such as social feed information, status updates, and other types of non-contact information.  In some embodiments, the metadata includes one or more of the
following: data store identifier, contact type, favorite status, ringtone, and information on whether the contact entity meets certain criteria (e.g., has phone, email, and/or store information).
<br/><br/> Referring again to FIG. 1, an exemplary block diagram illustrates the computing device 104 creating aggregated contact entries 110 from a plurality of data sources 124.  In the example of FIG. 1, the computing device 104 is associated with the
device user 102.  The computing device 104 represents any device executing instructions (e.g., as application programs, operating system functionality, or both) to implement the operations and functionality associated with the computing device 104.  The
computing device 104 may include a mobile computing device 502 or any other portable device.  In some embodiments, the mobile computing device 502 includes a mobile telephone, laptop, netbook, gaming device, and/or portable media player.  The computing
device 104 may also include less portable devices such as desktop personal computers, kiosks, and tabletop devices.  Additionally, the computing device 104 may represent a group of processing units or other computing devices.
<br/><br/> The computing device 104 has at least one processor 106, a user interface 107, and a memory area 108 (e.g., persistent memory).  The processor 106 includes any quantity of processing units, and is programmed to execute computer-executable
instructions for implementing aspects of the disclosure.  The instructions may be performed by the processor 106 or by multiple processors executing within the computing device 104, or performed by a processor external to the computing device 104.  In
some embodiments, the processor 106 is programmed to execute instructions such as those illustrated in the figures (e.g., FIG. 3 and FIG. 4).
<br/><br/> The user interface 107 includes any interface for communicating with the device user 102 of the computing device 104.  For example, the user interface 107 may provide content to the device user 102 visually (e.g., via a screen such as a touch
screen), audibly (e.g., via a speaker), and/or via touch (e.g., vibrations or other movement from the computing device 104).  In another example, the user interface 107 may receive from the user tactile input (e.g., via buttons, an alphanumeric keypad,
or a screen such as a touch screen) and/or audio input (e.g., via a microphone).  In further embodiments, the computing device 104 itself acts as the user interface 107 as the device user 102 moves the computing device 104 in a particular way to input
commands or manipulate data.
<br/><br/> The computing device 104 further has one or more computer-readable media such as the memory area 108.  The memory area 108 includes any quantity of media associated with or accessible to the computing device 104.  The memory area 108 may be
internal to the computing device 104 (as shown in FIG. 1), external to the computing device 104 (not shown), or both (not shown).
<br/><br/> The memory area 108 stores, among other data, a plurality of contact entries 110 such as contact entry #1 through contact entry #N. Each of the plurality of contact entries 110 references data items 302 associated with one of a plurality of
users.  For example, each of the contact entries 110 includes links 112 to the data items 302 associated with one of the plurality of users, such as links to data items associated with user #1 through links to data items associated with user #N.
<br/><br/> Other embodiments of the disclosure contemplate the memory area 108 storing a plurality of data items each referencing one or more contact entries.  In such embodiments, each of the data items stores the links 112.  Such embodiments are
semantically different from, yet substantively similar to, the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the data items 302 include one or more of the following items of contact information: names, telephone numbers, and electronic mail addresses.  In further embodiments, the data items 302 include one or more of the following
items of biographical data: job titles, company names, birthdays, and street addresses.  In still further embodiments, the data items 302 include one or more of the following: electronic mail message data, instant message data, social network message
data, and microblog data.  The data items 302 are provided by data sources 124 remote from the computing device 104 as illustrated in FIG. 1 or provided by data sources stored local to the computing device 104 (not shown).  The data sources 124 include,
for example, data source #1 through data source #M. The computing device 104 accesses the data sources 124 via a network 122 such as the Internet.  The network 122 includes, however, any wired and/or wireless network over which one or more protocols may
be implemented.
<br/><br/> The memory area 108 further stores applications (not shown) that, when executed by the processor 106, operate to perform functionality on the computing device 104.  Exemplary applications include mail application programs, web browsers, calendar
application programs, and address book application programs.  Each of the applications may store data items 302 on one or more of the data sources 124.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments (not shown), the memory area 108 further stores cached versions of the items stored by the data sources 124.
<br/><br/> The memory area 108 further stores one or more computer-executable components.  Exemplary components include an interface component 114, an aggregation component 116, a link component 118, and a ghosting component 120.  The interface component
114, when executed by the processor 106 of the computing device 104, causes the processor 106 to receive, from the device user 102 associated with the computing device 104, one or more first data items associated with one of a plurality of users.  The
aggregation component 116, when executed by the processor 106 of the computing device 104, causes the processor 106 to search the data sources 124 (or the cached versions thereof stored in the memory area 108) based on the first data items received by
the interface component 114 to identify second data items stored by one or more of the data sources 124.  In some embodiments, the aggregation component 116 does not access the network 122 when searching for data items to link, but instead searches the
memory area 108 for the data items.
<br/><br/> The link component 118, when executed by the processor 106 of the computing device 104, causes the processor 106 to define a group including the first data items and the second data items identified by the aggregation component 116.  In some
embodiments, the defined group includes at least one of the data items.  The defined group is associated with the one of the plurality of users.  For example, the defined group represents the data items associated with a particular user.  In some
embodiments, the link component 118 updates an existing group with the first data items received by the interface component 114 and with the second data items identified by the aggregation component 116.  For example, the first data items and the second
data items are linked to another group or contact.  The group may include a single data item.
<br/><br/> When further executed, the link component 118 creates one contact entry 110 providing access to the first data items and to the second data items associated with the defined group.  While the link component 118 does not merge or modify the first
data items or the second data items during the act of linking, the device user 102 is able to modify any of the first data items (that are read-write) or the second data items (that are read-write) linked to the created contact entry 110.  The data
modified by the user is then synchronized back to the data sources 124 (or other data sources associated with the first data items or the second data items).
<br/><br/> The link component 118 creates the contact entry 110 without seeking approval from the device user 102 after defining the group.  The interface component 114 provides the created contact entry 110 to the device user 102.  As illustrated in the
example of FIG. 1, the contact entry 110 may include links 112 or other metadata identifying the first data items and the second data items.  In some embodiments, the metadata representing the contact entries 110 may be shared among other computing
devices enabling the device user 102 to have access to the same aggregated contact entries 110 from any of the other computing devices.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the link component 118 further executes to analyze the defined group to identify false-positive matches in the second data items.  False-positive matches include data items that were linked incorrectly or inappropriately
(e.g., data items linked to the same person that are actually associated with different people).  The link component 118 removes the identified false-positive matches from the defined group.
<br/><br/> The ghosting component 120, when executed by the processor 106 of the computing device 104, causes the processor 106 to receive an annotation from the device user 102 and to store the received annotation with the contact entry 110 created by the
link component 118.  The annotation is stored without modifying the first data items associated with the defined group and without modifying the second data items associated with the defined group.  The annotation is associated with the defined group and
includes, for example, private or sensitive data, or any other note or text the device user 102 wants to associate with the contact entry 110.  For example, the annotation is stored as a field in the contact entries 110 along with fields storing the
corresponding links 112 to the first and second data items.
<br/><br/> In other embodiments, a new contact entry is created based on the contact entry 110 (e.g., inherits data from the contact entry 110 such as the links 112).  The annotation is then stored with this new contact entry rather than with the contact
entry 110.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the interface component 114, the aggregation component 116, the link component 118, and the ghosting component 120 execute as part of an operating system associated with the computing device 104.
<br/><br/> Additional operation details and architecture are described with reference to the figures next described.
<br/><br/> Referring next to FIG. 2, an exemplary block diagram illustrates linking between contact entries 110 and a plurality of data items.  Each contact entry 110 represents a person such as Person 1 or Person 2.  Each person is represented by an
aggregation or group of data items associated with each person.  In the example of FIG. 2, Data Item 1, Data Item 2, and Data Item 3 are linked to Person 1.  Data Item 4 is linked to Person 2.
<br/><br/> Referring next to FIG. 3, an exemplary flow chart illustrates operation of the computing device 104 to create aggregated contact entries 110 from multiple data sources 124.  While FIG. 3 illustrates the creation of groups based on the searching
of data items 302, other embodiments contemplate searching the existing groups to see if any are a match for the data items 302 as the data items 302 are received by the computing device 104.  In such embodiments, if no existing groups are deemed to be a
match for a particular data item 302, a new contact entry is created for the particular data item 302.
<br/><br/> Data items 302 from multiple data sources 124 are available to the computing device 104.  The data items 302 are associated with a plurality of users.  The computing device 104 searches the data items 302 at 304 to identify groups of the data
items 302.  For example, the computing device 104 searches for exact matches of the first and last names of the users as gating criteria, and uses email addresses and telephone numbers as corroborating data.  In other examples, the computing device 104
also searches for common email addresses, postal addresses, etc. as additional gating criteria.  In further embodiments, searching the data items 302 includes searching one or more of the following for data items 302 associated with the same user:
contact information, electronic mail message data, instant message data, social network message data, and microblog data.  The searching produces one or more groups of data items 302 where each of the groups is associated with one of the plurality of
users and each of the data items 302 within the group is associated with the one of the plurality of users.
<br/><br/> The groups are analyzed at 306.  For example, the computing device 104 searches for false-positive matches, or other mis-matched data items 302 within the groups.  In some embodiments, false-positive data item matches are identified by comparing
one or more of the following among the data items 302 within each of the groups: middle names, suffixes, telephone numbers, and electronic mail addresses.
<br/><br/> If false-positive matches are found at 308, the false-positive matches are purged or otherwise removed from the groups at 310.  If no false-positive matches are found at 308 or once the false-positives have been removed from the groups, one
contact entry 110 is created for each of the users at 312.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments (not shown), the groups are formed iteratively with false-positive matches being removed before the groups are actually defined.  For example, one contact record after another is examined (e.g., serially) to decide whether to
include the contact record in the group.  False-positive contact records are rejected prior to being included in the group.
<br/><br/> The contact entries 110 are created automatically, or otherwise without seeking approval from the device user 102 after identifying the groups of the data items 302, or as the groups are identified.  Further, the contact entries 110 are created
without modifying the data items 302 as stored by the data sources 124.  Each of the created (or updated) contact entries 110 includes, for example, metadata describing the particular user and links 112 or other references to each of the data items 302
associated with the particular user (e.g., group).
<br/><br/> The created contact entries 110 are provided to the device user 102 at 314.  The device user 102 interacts with the contact entries 110 with the computing device 104.  For example, the device user 102 views the contact entries 110 in an address
book application executing on the computing device 104.  In some embodiments, the device user 102 can edit the groups by manually adding other data items 302 or removing some of the linked data items 302 from the groups.  In further embodiments, the
device user 102 is able to add annotations or other notes to one or more of the contact entries 110.  For example, the device user 102 may add comments, personal or private opinions, and/or sensitive, non-public information associated with the users
represented by the contact entries 110.  In such embodiments, the computing device 104 receives an annotation from the device user 102 for one or more of the created contact entries 110 and stores the received annotation with the corresponding created
contact entries 110 (e.g., along with the metadata currently in the contact entries 110).  The annotations do not modify the linked data items 302 in embodiments in which the linked data items 302 are read-only, but the annotations may be propagated back
(e.g., synchronized) to the data sources 124.
<br/><br/> Other embodiments create a writeable contact entry in another store (e.g., portion of the memory area 108) that is linked to, and based on, one of the existing contact entries that is read-only.  The annotation is then stored with the writeable
contact entry and synchronizes to one or more of the data sources 124.  In such embodiments, the annotation is not stored with the read-only, existing contact entry, the linked data items 302 are not modified, and the annotation is synchronized to one or
more of the data sources 124 (e.g., to prevent loss of the annotation should the computing device 104 be lost or misplaced).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the contact entries 110 are stored in the cloud or other storage remote from the computing device 104 so that the device user 102 can access the contact entries 110 from other devices.  For example, the device user 102 may
access the contact entries 110 from a mobile telephone, work computer, computer at a library, gaming console, and/or netbook.
<br/><br/> The example of FIG. 3 illustrates a conservative approach for linking data items 302 that may not link some data items 302 that should be linked.  Aspects of the disclosure may be modified, within the scope of the disclosure, to more
aggressively link data items 302 to increase the quantity of linked data items 302.  In such embodiments, the suggested groupings may be presented to the device user 102 for confirmation.
<br/><br/> Referring next to FIG. 4, an exemplary flow chart illustrates operation of the computing device 104 to detect false positive matches when automatically linking contact entries 110.  In contrast to the flow illustrated in FIG. 3 (e.g., in which
data items or data sources are searched to create groups), the flow in FIG. 4 illustrates matching data items to existing groups (e.g., existing contact entries).  For example, for each data item received by the computing device 104, the existing contact
entries are searched to identify a matching contact entry (e.g., a candidate match).  The received data item is compared to one or more of the data items associated with the matching contact entry to determine whether or not the matching contact entry is
a false-positive match.  If the matching contact entry is not a false-positive match, the matching contact entry is updated to be associated with the received data item.  The matching contact entry is updated, for example, without seeking approval from
the device user and without modifying the received data item and/or the data items associated with the matching contact entry.  If the matching contact entry is a false-positive match, a new contact entry may be created for the received data item.  A
further example of the exemplary process is next described.
<br/><br/> The operations illustrated in FIG. 4 are performed at various times including, for example, automatically when a new contact is added by the device user 102 at 402.  If there is not an exact first and last name match between the names of the new
contact and any of the existing contact entries 110 at 404, and there is not an exact match between display names of the new contact and any of the existing contact entries 110 at 406, a new contact entry is created at 408.  If there is an exact match at
404, or if there is not an exact first and last name match at 404 but there is a display name match at 406, the matching contact entry (or a plurality of matching contact entries 110) is regarded as a candidate contract entry.  False positive protection
is performed on the candidate contact entry to confirm that the candidate contact entry is not a false positive match.  In some embodiments, the process determines whether the new contact name contains a space at 410 then proceeds to perform false
positive protection operations.  The existence of a space helps determine, in some embodiments, whether sufficient information exists to create a link.
<br/><br/> In the example of FIG. 4, the false positive protection operations are performed when there is an exact match at 404, or when there is not an exact match at 404 but there is an exact match at 406 (whether or not the name contains a space at
410).  False positive protection includes, for example, comparing one or more of the following between the new contact entry and the candidate contact entry: middle name, suffix, store (e.g., the service associated with the contact entry), telephone
number, and electronic mail address.
<br/><br/> If there is a mismatch between the middle names or suffixes of the new contact and the candidate contact entry at 412, the candidate contact entry is considered to be questionable at 422.  If there is not a mismatch at 412 and the new contact
and the candidate contact entry are not associated with the same store at 414, the candidate contact entry is approved at 416.  For example, the operations execute to prevent two contacts from the same social networking website to be linked automatically
without corroborating data.  If the new contact and the candidate contact entry are associated with the same store at 414, the candidate contact entry is considered to be questionable at 422.  Otherwise, the candidate contact entry is approved at 416.
<br/><br/> If the candidate contact entry has been marked as questionable at 422, one or more of the telephone numbers and electronic mail addresses of the new contact and the candidate contact entry are compared at 424.  If there is no shared data at 424,
a new contact entry is created at 408.  If there is shared data at 424, the shared data is considered to be corroborating data and the questionable candidate contact entry is approved at 426.
<br/><br/> After the candidate contact entry is approved at 416 or 426, the new contact is automatically linked to the candidate contact entry at 418.  In other embodiments not illustrated in FIG. 4, the candidate contact entry is presented to the device
user 102 for explicit or manual approval by the device user 102 before the new contact is linked to the candidate contact entry at 418.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments (not shown), the false positive protection operations further calculate, generate, or otherwise produce a confidence factor for the identified candidate contact entry.  The confidence factor represents the confidence or
probability that the candidate contact entry is an appropriate match to the new contact input by the device user 102.
<br/><br/> Referring next to FIG. 5, an exemplary mobile computing device 502 illustrates linked contact entries and suggested contact entries to link in a user interface 504.  In the example of FIG. 5, the contact entries are referred to as profiles.  The
user interface 504 shows the linked profiles and the suggested profiles for linking for an exemplary contact "A. Friend" when a user of the mobile computing device 502 (e.g., device user 102) accesses contacts (e.g., chooses to view links from viewing a
contact entry from an address book application).  The linked profiles include "Abe Friend" from the Professionals Network Website Y and "A. Friend" from the Social Network Website X. The suggested profile to be linked is "Abe Friend" on a Mail Server. 
The Professionals Network Website Y, the Social Network Website X, and the Mail Server represent stores (e.g., data stores) hosting, storing, or otherwise affiliated with the corresponding profiles.
<br/><br/> The user interface 504 allows the user to select the suggested profile for linking, or deselect any of the existing linked profiles (e.g., unlink the profiles).  In some embodiments, the profiles are automatically linked only when new contact
entries are added to avoid automatically re-linking the profiles that were unlinked by the user.
<br/><br/> As the user links additional profiles, the profiles are added to the list of linked profiles shown in the user interface 504.  When finished linking profiles, the user returns to the contacts application (or other address book type of
application) to view aggregated data from all the linked profiles.  For each group of linked profiles, the data is shown as a single, unified contact in each application executing on the mobile computing device 502 that displays contact information. 
That is, each of the applications is able to access the metadata representing the linked profiles.
<br/><br/>Additional Examples
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the metadata representing the linked contact entries includes conditional metadata defining when to display the linked contact entries 110, and when to display only the contact entries 110 associated with a particular
application or store.  For example, each contact entry 110 includes data identifying the associated application, and the user can choose to see only the contact entries 110 associated with a particular application.  For example, the device user 102 may
define the conditional metadata to display the linked contact entries 110 only during non-business hours so that data from contact entries 110 associated with social networking websites is not displayed while the device user 102 is at work.  In another
example, the device user 102 may define the conditional metadata to display the linked contact entries 110 based on a location of the mobile computing device 502 (e.g., via global positioning satellite technology in the mobile computing device 502).  In
such an example, the device user 102 may opt for the linked contact entries 110 to be displayed at locations other than locations designated as "work" locations.
<br/><br/> In still another example, the conditional metadata may be defined to display the linked contact entries 110 based on the execution of other applications.  In this example, the device user 102 may opt for the linked contact entries 110 to be
displayed if social networking applications or gaming applications are being executed on the mobile computing device 502.
<br/><br/> In an example scenario, the user of the mobile computing device 502 configures the mobile computing device 502 to access personal accounts such as social network accounts.  Shortly after configuration, the mobile computing device 502 executes
operations such as described herein to automatically link matching contact entries across the accounts.  The user notices that there are no duplicate contact entries, but there are some standalone, unlinked contact entries with nicknames or incomplete
data that prevented linking.  Aspects of the disclosure may provide suggestions for linking the remaining contact entries.  The user is quickly able to manually link one or more of these remaining contact entries to other contact entries.  In this
example scenario, the mobile computing device 502 has intelligently linked the obvious matches (or those with a high confidence factor) to simplify the out-of-box experience for the user.
