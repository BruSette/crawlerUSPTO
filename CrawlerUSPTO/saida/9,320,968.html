<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method of matching requests and responses of different data types in an online game, comprising: receiving a request from a first user in an online system, the request
including a request value corresponding to a first data type, the first data type including one of text, image or audio;  receiving a distribution list for the online game, the distribution list including a plurality of users in the online system; 
sending request messages to the plurality of users, each request message including the request value corresponding to the first data type and a request to respond with a response value corresponding to a second data type, the second data type including
one of text, image or audio and being different from the first data type;  receiving response messages from the plurality of users, each response message including a corresponding response value corresponding to the second data type;  sending a request
for the first user to select a winning response value from the response values included in the response messages received from the plurality of users, the winning response value being characterized as a best match selected from the response values to
match the request value from a comparison that relates the response values to the request value;  receiving from the first user a selection of the winning response value, the selection being made from the response values included in the response messages
received from the plurality of users;  and sending one or more announcement messages to announce the winning response value.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, wherein the first data type includes text data, the second data type includes image data, the request value corresponds to a description comprising one or more words, the request to respond includes a request for a
photo that corresponds to the description, and the response messages each include an image file or a reference to an image file.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1, wherein the first data type includes text data, the second data type includes audio data, the request value corresponds to a description comprising one or more words, the request to respond includes a request for a
recorded message that corresponds to the description, and the response messages each include an audio file or a reference to an audio file.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 1, wherein the first data type includes image data, the second data type includes text data, the request value corresponds to an image file or a reference to an image file, the request to respond includes a request for a
description comprising one or more words that correspond to an image produced by the image file, and the response messages each include text values or a reference to text values.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 1, wherein the first data type includes image data, the second data type includes audio data, the request value corresponds to an image file or a reference to an image file, the request to respond includes a request for a
recorded message that corresponds to an image produced by the image file, and the response messages each include an audio file or a reference to an audio file.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 1, wherein the first data type includes audio data, the second data type includes text data, the request value corresponds to an audio file or a reference to an audio file, the request to respond includes a request for a
description comprising one or more words that correspond to sounds produced by the audio file, and the response messages each include text values or a reference to text values.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 1, wherein the first data type includes audio data, the second data type includes image data, the request value corresponds to an audio file or a reference to an audio file, the request to respond includes a request for
an image that corresponds to sounds produced by the audio file, and the response messages each include an image file or a reference to an image file.
<br/><br/> 8.  The method of claim 1, wherein the distribution list does not include the first user.
<br/><br/> 9.  The method of claim 1, wherein the winning response value is a first winning response value, the distribution list is a first distribution list, and the method further comprises: receiving a second distribution list for the online game, the
second distribution list including one or more users in the online system;  sending response values from at least some of the response messages to the one or more users in the second distribution list with a request to vote for a second winning response
value;  receiving one or more voting messages from the one or more users in the second distribution list, each voting message including a vote for the selection of the second winning response value;  and determining the second winning response value from
the one or more votes in the one or more voting messages.
<br/><br/> 10.  The method of claim 1, further comprising awarding point values associated with the online game to a winning user that corresponds to the winning response value.
<br/><br/> 11.  The method of claim 1, wherein the online game is hosted by a computer system that stores online-game values in a data storage system.
<br/><br/> 12.  The method of claim 1, wherein the response messages include a first response message comprising an index to a storage system that stores second-data-type values for the first response message.
<br/><br/> 13.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: storing at least some of the response values in a storage system that stores second-data-type values;  receiving a deletion request to delete a given entry in the storage system, the deletion
request being associated with a given user who sent a given response message that corresponds to the given entry;  and deleting the given entry in the storage system in response to the deletion request.
<br/><br/> 14.  The method of claim 1, further comprising: accessing a filter that identifies undesirable content of the second data type by comparing second-data-type values with at least one criterion for undesirable content;  and using the filter to
eliminate from the one or more response messages an undesirable response message that includes undesirable content.
<br/><br/> 15.  The method of claim 1, wherein the winning response represents a descriptive characterization selected from the response values corresponding to the second data type for the request value corresponding to the first data type.
<br/><br/> 16.  A non-transitory computer-readable medium that stores a computer program for matching requests and responses of different data types in an online game, the computer program including instructions that, when executed by a computer, cause the
computer to perform operations comprising: receiving a request from a first user in an online system, the request including a request value corresponding to a first data type, the first data type including one of text, image or audio;  receiving a
distribution list for the online game, the distribution list including a plurality of users in the online system;  sending request messages to the plurality of users, each request message including the request value corresponding to the first data type
and a request to respond with a response value corresponding to a second data type, the second data type including one of text, image or audio and being different from the first data type;  receiving response messages from the plurality of users, each
response message including a corresponding response value corresponding to the second data type;  sending a request for the first user to select a winning response value from the response values included in the response messages received from the
plurality of users, the winning response value being characterized as a best match selected from the response values to match the request value from a comparison that relates the response values to the request value;  receiving from the first user a

<br/><br/> The present disclosure generally relates to games and applications in general and, in particular embodiments, to computer-implemented online games.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> In many games, there is a virtual world or some other imagined playing space where a player/user of the game controls one or more player characters (herein "character," "player character," or "PC").  Player characters can be considered in-game
representations of the controlling player.  As used herein, the terms "player," "user," "entity," and "friend" may refer to the in-game player character controlled by that player, user, entity, or friend, unless context suggests otherwise.  The game
display can display a representation of the player character.  A game engine accepts inputs from the player, determines player character actions, decides the outcomes of events, and presents the player with a game display illuminating what happened.  In
some games, there are multiple players, wherein each player controls one or more player characters.
<br/><br/> In many computer games, there are various types of in-game assets (aka "rewards" or "loot") that a player character can obtain within the game.  For example, a player character may acquire game points, gold coins, experience points, character
levels, character attributes, virtual cash, game keys, or other in-game items of value.  In many computer games, there are also various types of in-game obstacles that a player must overcome to advance within the game.  In-game obstacles can include
tasks, puzzles, opponents, levels, gates, actions, and so forth.  In some games, a goal of the game may be to acquire certain in-game assets, which can then be used to complete in-game tasks or to overcome certain in-game obstacles.  For example, a
player may be able to acquire a virtual key (i.e., the in-game asset) that can then be used to open a virtual door (i.e., the in-game obstacle).
<br/><br/> An electronic social networking system typically operates with one or more social networking servers providing interaction between users such that a user can specify other users of the social networking system as "friends." A collection of users
and the "friend" connections between users can form a social graph that can be traversed to find second, third and more remote connections between users, much like a graph of nodes connected by edges can be traversed.
<br/><br/> Many online computer games are operated on an online social network.  Such a network allows both users and other parties to interact with the computer games directly, whether to play the games or to retrieve game- or user-related information. 
Internet users may maintain one or more accounts with various service providers, including, for example, online game networking systems and online social networking systems.  Online systems can typically be accessed using browser clients (e.g., MICROSOFT
INTERNET EXPLORER, MOZILLA FIREFOX, APPLE SAFARI, GOOGLE CHROME).
<br/><br/> In many computer games, there are various types of in-game actions that a player character can make within the game.  For example, a player character in an online role-playing game may be able to interact with other player characters, build a
virtual house, attack enemies, go on a quest, go to a virtual store to buy/sell virtual items, and so forth.  A player character in an online poker game may be able to play at specific tables, place bets of virtual currency for certain amounts, play or
fold certain hands, play in a online poker tournament, and so forth.
<br/><br/> In many computer games, these in-game actions include sharing information between players.  However, this information exchange is typically limited to specific data types (e.g., through text messages).  Thus, there is a need for improved gaming
methods that include exchanging information with different data types. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a system for implementing various disclosed embodiments.  In particular embodiments, system 100 comprises player 101, social networking system 120a, game networking system 120b, client system 130, and network
160.  The components of system 100 can be connected to each other in any suitable configuration, using any suitable type of connection.  The components may be connected directly or over a network 160, which may be any suitable network.  For example, one
or more portions of network 160 may be an ad hoc network, an intranet, an extranet, a virtual private network (VPN), a local area network (LAN), a wireless LAN (WLAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless WAN (WWAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a
portion of the Internet, a portion of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), a cellular telephone network, another type of network, or a combination of two or more such networks.
<br/><br/> Social networking system 120a is a network-addressable computing system that can host one or more social graphs.  Social networking system 120a can generate, store, receive, and transmit social networking data.  Social networking system 120a can
be accessed by the other components of system 100 either directly or via network 160.  Game networking system 120b is a network-addressable computing system that can host one or more online games.  Game networking system 120b can generate, store,
receive, and transmit game-related data, such as, for example, game account data, game input, game state data, and game displays.  Game networking system 120b can be accessed by the other components of system 100 either directly or via network 160. 
Player 101 may use client system 130 to access, send data to, and receive data from social networking system 120a and game networking system 120b.  Client system 130 can access social networking system 120 or game networking system 120b directly, via
network 160, or via a third-party system.  As an example and not by way of limitation, client system 130 may access game networking system 120b via social networking system 120a.  Client system 130 can be any suitable computing device, such as a personal
computer, laptop, cellular phone, smart phone, computing tablet, and so forth.
<br/><br/> Although FIG. 1 illustrates a particular number of players 101, social networking systems 120a, game networking systems 120b, client systems 130, and networks 160, this disclosure contemplates any suitable number of players 101, social
networking systems 120a, game networking systems 120b, client systems 130, and networks 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, system 100 may include one or more game networking systems 120b and no social networking systems 120a.  As another
example and not by way of limitation, system 100 may include a system that comprises both social networking system 120a and game networking system 120b.  Moreover, although FIG. 1 illustrates a particular arrangement of player 101, social networking
system 120a, game networking system 120b, client system 130, and network 160, this disclosure contemplates any suitable arrangement of player 101, social networking system 120a, game networking system 120b, client system 130, and network 160.
<br/><br/> The components of system 100 may be connected to each other using any suitable connections 110.  For example, suitable connections 110 include wireline (such as, for example, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or Data Over Cable Service Interface
Specification (DOCSIS)), wireless (such as, for example, Wi-Fi or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)) or optical (such as, for example, Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) or Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)) connections.  In
particular embodiments, one or more connections 110 each include an ad hoc network, an intranet, an extranet, a VPN, a LAN, a WLAN, a WAN, a WWAN, a MAN, a portion of the Internet, a portion of the PSTN, a cellular telephone network, or another type of
connection, or a combination of two or more such connections.  Connections 110 need not necessarily be the same throughout system 100.  One or more first connections 110 may differ in one or more respects from one or more second connections 110. 
Although FIG. 1 illustrates particular connections between player 101, social networking system 120a, game networking system 120b, client system 130, and network 160, this disclosure contemplates any suitable connections between player 101, social
networking system 120a, game networking system 120b, client system 130, and network 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, in particular embodiments, client system 130 may have a direct connection to social networking system 120a or game
networking system 120b, bypassing network 160.
<br/><br/> Online Games and Game Systems
<br/><br/> In an online computer game, a game engine manages the game state of the game.  Game state comprises all game play parameters, including player character state, non-player character (NPC) state, in-game object state, game world state (e.g.,
internal game clocks, game environment), and other game play parameters.  Each player 101 controls one or more player characters (PCs).  The game engine controls all other aspects of the game, including non-player characters (NPCs), and in-game objects. 
The game engine also manages game state, including player character state for currently active (online) and inactive (offline) players.
<br/><br/> An online game can be hosted by game networking system 120b, which can be accessed using any suitable connection with a suitable client system 130.  A player may have a game account on game networking system 120b, wherein the game account can
contain a variety of information associated with the player (e.g., the player's personal information, financial information, purchase history, player character state, game state).  In some embodiments, a player may play multiple games on game networking
system 120b, which may maintain a single game account for the player with respect to all the games, or multiple individual game accounts for each game with respect to the player.  In some embodiments, game networking system 120b can assign a unique
identifier to each player 101 of an online game hosted on game networking system 120b.  Game networking system 120b can determine that a player 101 is accessing the online game by reading the user's cookies, which may be appended to HTTP requests
transmitted by client system 130, and/or by the player 101 logging onto the online game.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, player 101 may access an online game and control the game's progress via client system 130 (e.g., by inputting commands to the game at the client device).  Client system 130 can display the game interface, receive
inputs from player 101, transmitting user inputs or other events to the game engine, and receive instructions from the game engine.  The game engine can be executed on any suitable system (such as, for example, client system 130, social networking system
120a, or game networking system 120b).  As an example and not by way of limitation, client system 130 can download client components of an online game, which are executed locally, while a remote game server, such as game networking system 120b, provides
backend support for the client components and may be responsible for maintaining application data of the game, processing the inputs from the player, updating and/or synchronizing the game state based on the game logic and each input from the player, and
transmitting instructions to client system 130.  As another example and not by way of limitation, each time player 101 provides an input to the game through the client system 130 (such as, for example, by typing on the keyboard or clicking the mouse of
client system 130), the client components of the game may transmit the player's input to game networking system 120b.
<br/><br/> Game Systems, Social Networks, and Social Graphs
<br/><br/> In an online multiplayer game, players may control player characters (PCs), a game engine controls non-player characters (NPCs) and game features, and the game engine also manages player character state and game state and tracks the state for
currently active (i.e., online) players and currently inactive (i.e., offline) players.  A player character can have a set of attributes and a set of friends associated with the player character.  As used herein, the term "player character state" can
refer to any in-game characteristic of a player character, such as location, assets, levels, condition, health, status, inventory, skill set, name, orientation, affiliation, specialty, and so on.  Player characters may be displayed as graphical avatars
within a user interface of the game.  In other implementations, no avatar or other graphical representation of the player character is displayed.  Game state encompasses the notion of player character state and refers to any parameter value that
characterizes the state of an in-game element, such as a non-player character, a virtual object (such as a wall or castle), and so forth.  The game engine may use player character state to determine the outcome of game events, sometimes also considering
set or random variables.  Generally, a player character's probability of having a more favorable outcome is greater when the player character has a better state.  For example, a healthier player character is less likely to die in a particular encounter
relative to a weaker player character or non-player character.  In some embodiments, the game engine can assign a unique client identifier to each player.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, player 101 may access particular game instances of an online game.  A game instance is copy of a specific game play area that is created during runtime.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a game instance is a discrete game play area where one or more players 101 can interact in synchronous or asynchronous play.  A game instance may be, for example, a level, zone, area, region, location, virtual space,
or other suitable play area.  A game instance may be populated by one or more in-game objects.  Each object may be defined within the game instance by one or more variables, such as, for example, position, height, width, depth, direction, time, duration,
speed, color, and other suitable variables.  A game instance may be exclusive (i.e., accessible by specific players) or non-exclusive (i.e., accessible by any player).  In particular embodiments, a game instance is populated by one or more player
characters controlled by one or more players 101 and one or more in-game objects controlled by the game engine.  When accessing an online game, the game engine may allow player 101 to select a particular game instance to play from a plurality of game
instances.  Alternatively, the game engine may automatically select the game instance that player 101 will access.  In particular embodiments, an online game comprises only one game instance that all players 101 of the online game can access.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a specific game instance may be associated with one or more specific players.  A game instance is associated with a specific player when one or more game parameters of the game instance are associated with the specific
player.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a game instance associated with a first player may be named "First Player's Play Area." This game instance may be populated with the first player's PC and one or more in-game objects associated with
the first player.  In particular embodiments, a game instance associated with a specific player may only be accessible by that specific player.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a first player may access a first game instance when playing an
online game, and this first game instance may be inaccessible to all other players.  In other embodiments, a game instance associated with a specific player may be accessible by one or more other players, either synchronously or asynchronously with the
specific player's game play.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a first player may be associated with a first game instance, but the first game instance may be accessed by all first-degree friends in the first player's social network.  In
particular embodiments, the game engine may create a specific game instance for a specific player when that player accesses the game.  As an example and not by way of limitation, the game engine may create a first game instance when a first player
initially accesses an online game, and that same game instance may be loaded each time the first player accesses the game.  As another example and not by way of limitation, the game engine may create a new game instance each time a first player accesses
an online game, wherein each game instance may be created randomly or selected from a set of predetermined game instances.  In particular embodiments, the set of in-game actions available to a specific player may be different in a game instance that is
associated with that player compared to a game instance that is not associated with that player.  The set of in-game actions available to a specific player in a game instance associated with that player may be a subset, superset, or independent of the
set of in-game actions available to that player in a game instance that is not associated with him.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a first player may be associated with Blackacre Farm in an online farming game.  The first player may be able
to plant crops on Blackacre Farm.  If the first player accesses game instance associated with another player, such as Whiteacre Farm, the game engine may not allow the first player to plant crops in that game instance.  However, other in-game actions may
be available to the first player, such as watering or fertilizing crops on Whiteacre Farm.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a game engine can interface with a social graph.  Social graphs are models of connections between entities (e.g., individuals, users, contacts, friends, players, player characters, non-player characters, businesses,
groups, associations, concepts, etc.).  These entities are considered "users" of the social graph; as such, the terms "entity" and "user" may be used interchangeably when referring to social graphs herein.  A social graph can have a node for each entity
and edges to represent relationships between entities.  A node in a social graph can represent any entity.  In particular embodiments, a unique client identifier can be assigned to each user in the social graph.  In general, this disclosure assumes that
at least one entity of a social graph is a player or player character in an online multiplayer game, although this disclosure is applicable to players or player characters that are not characterized as entities of a social graph.
<br/><br/> The minimum number of edges required to connect a player (or player character) to another user is considered the degree of separation between them.  For example, where the player and the user are directly connected (one edge), they are deemed to
be separated by one degree of separation.  The user would be a so-called "first-degree friend" of the player.  Where the player and the user are connected through one other user (two edges), they are deemed to be separated by two degrees of separation. 
This user would be a so-called "second-degree friend" of the player.  Where the player and the user are connected through N edges (or N-1 other users), they are deemed to be separated by N degrees of separation.  This user would be a so-called
"Nth-degree friend." As used herein, the term "friend" means only first-degree friends, unless context suggests otherwise.
<br/><br/> Within the social graph, each player (or player character) has a social network.  A player's social network includes all users in the social graph within N.sub.max degrees of the player, where N.sub.max is the maximum degree of separation
allowed by the system managing the social graph (such as, for example, social networking system 120a or game networking system 120b).  In one embodiment, N.sub.max equals 1, such that the player's social network includes only first-degree friends.  In
another embodiment, N.sub.max is unlimited and the player's social network is coextensive with the social graph.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the social graph is managed by game networking system 120b, which is managed by the game operator.  In other embodiments, the social graph is part of a social networking system 120a managed by a third-party (e.g.,
<b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Friendster, Myspace).  In yet other embodiments, player 101 has a social network on both game networking system 120b and social networking system 120a, wherein player 101 can have a social network on the game networking system 120b that is a
subset, superset, or independent of the player's social network on social networking system 120a.  In such combined systems, game network system 120b can maintain social graph information with edge type attributes that indicate whether a given friend is
an "in-game friend," an "out-of-game friend," or both.  The various embodiments disclosed herein are operable when the social graph is managed by social networking system 120a, game networking system 120b, or both.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 shows an example of a social network within a social graph.  As shown, Player 201 can be associated, connected or linked to various other users, or "friends," within the social network 200.  These associations, connections or links can
track relationships between users within the social network 200 and are commonly referred to as online "friends" or "friendships" between users.  Each friend or friendship in a particular user's social network within a social graph is commonly referred
to as a "node." For purposes of illustration and not by way of limitation, the details of social network 200 will be described in relation to Player 201.  As used herein, the terms "player" and "user" can be used interchangeably and can refer to any user
or character in an online multiuser game system or social networking system.  As used herein, the term "friend" can mean any node within a player's social network.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 2, Player 201 has direct connections with several friends.  When Player 201 has a direct connection with another individual, that connection is referred to as a first-degree friend.  In social network 200, Player 201 has four
first-degree friends.  That is, Player 201 is directly connected to Friend 1.sub.1 211, Friend 2.sub.1 221, Friend 3.sub.1 231, and Friend 4.sub.1 241.  In a social graph, it is possible for individuals to be connected to other individuals through their
first-degree friends (i.e., friends of friends).  As described above, each edge required to connect a player to another user is considered the degree of separation.  For example, FIG. 2 shows that Player 201 has three second-degree friends to which he is
connected via his connection to his first-degree friends.  Second-degree Friend 1.sub.2 212 and Friend 2.sub.2 222 are connected to Player 201 via his first-degree Friend 1.sub.1 211, and second-degree Friend 4.sub.2 242 is connected to Player 201 via
his first-degree Friend 3.sub.1 231.  The limit on the depth of friend connections, or the number of degrees of separation for associations, that Player 201 is allowed is typically dictated by the restrictions and policies implemented by social
networking system 120a.
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, Player 201 can have Nth-degree friends connected to him through a chain of intermediary degree friends as indicated in FIG. 2.  For example, Nth-degree Friend 1.sub.N 219 is connected to Player 201 via second-degree
Friend 3.sub.2 232 and one or more other higher-degree friends.  Various embodiments may take advantage of and utilize the distinction between the various degrees of friendship relative to Player 201.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a player (or player character) can have a social graph within an online multiplayer game that is maintained by the game engine and another social graph maintained by a separate social networking system.  FIG. 2 depicts
an example of in-game social network 260 and out-of-game social network 250.  In this example, Player 201 has out-of-game connections 255 to a plurality of friends, forming out-of-game social network 250.  Here, Friend 1.sub.1 211 and Friend 2.sub.1 221
are first-degree friends with Player 201 in his out-of-game social network 250.  Player 201 also has in-game connections 265 to a plurality of players, forming in-game social network 260.  Here, Friend 2.sub.1 221, Friend 3.sub.1 231, and Friend 4.sub.1
241 are first-degree friends with Player 201 in his in-game social network 260, and Friend 4.sub.2 242 is a second-degree friend.  In some embodiments, it is possible for a friend to be in both the out-of-game social network 250 and the in-game social
network 260.  Here, Friend 2.sub.1 221 has both an out-of-game connection 255 and an in-game connection 265 with Player 201, such that Friend 2.sub.1 221 is in both Player 201's in-game social network 260 and Player 201's out-of-game social network 250.
<br/><br/> As with other social networks, Player 201 can have second-degree and higher-degree friends in both his in-game and out of game social networks.  In some embodiments, it is possible for Player 201 to have a friend connected to him both in his
in-game and out-of-game social networks, wherein the friend is at different degrees of separation in each network.  For example, if Friend 2.sub.2 222 had a direct in-game connection with Player 201, Friend 2.sub.2 222 would be a second-degree friend in
Player 201's out-of-game social network, but a first-degree friend in Player 201's in-game social network.  In particular embodiments, a game engine can access in-game social network 260, out-of-game social network 250, or both.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the connections in a player's in-game social network can be formed both explicitly (e.g., users must "friend" each other) and implicitly (e.g., the system observes user behaviors and "friends" users to each other). 
Unless otherwise indicated, reference to a friend connection between two or more players can be interpreted to cover both explicit and implicit connections, using one or more social graphs and other factors to infer friend connections.  The friend
connections can be unidirectional or bidirectional.  It is also not a limitation of this description that two players who are deemed "friends" for the purposes of this disclosure are not friends in real life (i.e., in disintermediated interactions or the
like), but that could be the case.
<br/><br/> Game Systems and Game Interfaces
<br/><br/> A game event may be an outcome of an engagement, a provision of access, rights and/or benefits, or the obtaining of some assets (e.g., health, money, strength, inventory, land, etc.).  A game engine determines the outcome of a game event
according to a variety of factors, such as the game rules, a player character's in-game actions, player character state, game state, interactions of other player characters, and random calculations.  Engagements can include simple tasks (e.g., plant a
crop, clean a stove), complex tasks (e.g., build a farm or business, run a cafe), or other events.
<br/><br/> An online game can be hosted by a game networking system, which can be accessed over any suitable network with an appropriate client system (e.g., as in FIG. 10).  A player may have a game system account on a game system, wherein the game system
account can contain a variety of information about the player (e.g., the player's personal information, player character state, game state, etc.).  In various embodiments, an online game can be embedded into a third-party website.  The game can be hosted
by the networking system of the third-party website, or it can be hosted on the game system and merely accessed via the third-party website.  The embedded online game can be hosted solely on a server of the game system or use a third-party vendor server. In addition, any combination of the functions of the present disclosure can be hosted on or provided from any number of distributed network resources.  For example, one or more executable code objects that implement all or a portion of the game can be
downloaded to a client system for execution.
<br/><br/> A webpage-based game interface for an online game may be accessed by a browser client (e.g., MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER, MOZILLA FIREFOX, GOOGLE CHROME).  In various embodiments, a user of a client system 130 can use a browser client to access
the online game over the Internet (or other suitable network).  A game interface may be automatically generated and presented to the user in response to the user visiting or accessing the game operator's website or a third-party's website from client
system 130 with a browser client.  Game system 120b can transmit data to client system 130, allowing it to display the game interface, which is typically some type of graphic user interface.  For example, the webpage downloaded to client system 130 may
include an embedded call that causes client system 130 to download an executable object, such as a Flash .SWF object, which executes on client system 130 and renders the game within the context of the webpage.  Other interface types are possible, such as
server-side rendering and the like.  Typically a game interface is configured to receive signals from the user via client system 130.  For example, the user may click on a game interface, or enter commands from a keyboard or other suitable input device. 
The game engine can respond to these signals to allow game play.  The display of a game interface may change based on the output of the game engine, the input of the player, and other signals from game system 120b and client system 130.
<br/><br/> Typically a game interface can display various game components, such as the game environment, options available to the player (e.g., in-game actions, preferences, settings, etc.), game results, and so forth.  Some components of the game
interface may be static, while others may be dynamic (e.g., changing with game play).  The user may be able to interact with some components (e.g., player character, NPCs, virtual objects, etc.) and not interact with other components (e.g., the
background of the virtual world, such as the virtual street or sidewalk).  The user may engage in specific in-game actions or activities by providing input to the game interface
<br/><br/> Virtual Currency
<br/><br/> In various embodiments, players within the game can acquire virtual currency.  In such games, the virtual currency might be represented by virtual coins, virtual cash, or by a number or value stored by the server for that player's benefit.  Such
virtual currency represents units of value for use in the online game system and is analogous to legal currency.  Virtual currency can be purchased in one or more actual cash or credit transactions by a player, where the legal currency is transferred
using a credit/debit/charge card transaction conveyed over a financial network.  In some embodiments, a player may earn virtual currency by taking action in the game.  For example, a player may be rewarded with one or more units of virtual currency after
completing a task, quest, challenge, or mission within the game.  For example, a farming game might reward 10 gold coins each time a virtual crop is harvested.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, virtual currency can be used to purchase one or more in-game assets or other benefits.  For example, a player may be able to exchange virtual currency for a desired level, access, right, or item in an online game.  In one
embodiment, legal currency can be used to directly purchase an in-game asset or other benefit.  The player can select the desired in-game asset or other benefit.  Once the selections are made, the player can place the order to purchase the in-game asset
or other benefit.  This order is received by the game system, which can then process the order.  If the order is processed successfully, an appropriate financial account associated with the player can be debited by the amount of virtual currency or legal
currency needed to buy the selected in-game asset or other benefit.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, multiple types of virtual currency may be available for purchase from the game system operator.  For example, an online game may have virtual gold coins and virtual cash.  The different types of virtual currency may have
different exchange rates with respect to legal currency and each other.  For example, a player may be able to exchange $1 in legal currency for either 100 virtual gold coins or $2 in virtual cash, but virtual gold coins may not be exchanged for virtual
cash.  Similarly, where in-game assets and other benefits can be purchased with virtual currency, they may have different exchange rates with respect to the different types of virtual currency.  For example, a player may be able to buy a virtual business
object for $10 in virtual cash, but may not purchase the virtual business object for virtual gold coins alone.  In some embodiments, certain types of virtual currency can be acquired by engaging in various in-game actions while other types of virtual
currency can only be acquired by exchanging legal currency.  For example, a player may be able to acquire virtual gold coins by selling virtual goods in a business, but can only acquire virtual cash by exchanging legal currency.  In some implementations,
virtual cash may also be awarded for leveling up in the game.
<br/><br/> Game Mechanic with Matching of Different Data Types
<br/><br/> In accordance with certain embodiments, a game mechanic facilitates a game where users match different data types.  FIG. 3 shows example data types 300 including text 302, image 304 and audio 306.  For example text data 302 may include a
standard text format such as American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) or TXT.  Standard formats for image data 304 include Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) and Tagged Image File Format (TIFF).  Standard formats for audio data 306
include WINDOWS Media Audio (WMA) and Waveform Audio (WAV) used in WINDOWS Personal Computers.  A typical application of the game mechanic includes matching a "request" of one type with a "response" of another type.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 shows a flowchart that illustrates a method 308 of matching requests and responses of different data types in an online game according to an example embodiment.  A first operation 310 includes receiving a request that includes request
values corresponding to a first data type where the first data type includes one of text 302, image 304 or audio 306.  A second operation 312 includes receiving a distribution list for the online game where the distribution list includes one or more
users in an online system.  Then a third operation 314 includes sending messages to the one or more users.  Each request message includes at least a portion of the request values and a request to respond with values corresponding to a second data type
that includes one of text, image or audio and is different from the first data type.  These request messages can be sent by conventional means including, for example, email messages, Short Message Service (SMS) messages, or other broadcast messages to
the users in the distribution list.  A fourth operation 316 includes receiving one or more response messages from the one or more users, where each response message includes response values corresponding to the second data type.  For example, the
response messages may include files for the data types listed above or alternatively file pointers or other file references.  A fifth operation 318 includes receiving a selection of winning response values from the response values included in the one or
more response messages.  As discussed in greater detail below, the winner may be selected by a user who originally provided the request or by other means such as a voting process in the online system.  A sixth operation 320 includes sending one or more
announcement messages to one or more of the one or more users to announce the winning response values.  In some embodiments, the method may further include awarding point values associated with the online game to a winning user that corresponds to the
winning response values.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 shows a portion 330 of an example user interface where new games are announced with a request 332 to respond with a photo (i.e., image data).  In this case there are three independent requests that each include a single word (i.e., text
data).  John requests a photo match for the word "happy" 334, Mary requests a photo match for the word "pretty" 336, and Steve requests a photo match for the word "hot" 338.  In this embodiment the user who receives this interface may select (e.g., by
mouse click) any one of these three options based on the word ("happy," "pretty," "hot") and the corresponding player (John, Mary, Steve).  Selecting one of these game options facilitates sending a photo response (e.g., though email or an additional
window interface).  In some embodiments where photos are indexed in a central repository, an index or reference value may be sent.  The central repository may be a third-party repository to which a user is provided access, or alternatively, the
repository may be included in a server where a user has control over access and content but which is hosted with the game data.  Alternatively, an index or reference value or link may be sent, which is a link to a file of a data type on the Internet. 
Another example embodiment may include a third-party repository with the data mirrored on a central repository.  Users may be able to "delete" photos in the third-party repository, thus protecting their privacy, but data may still remain in the central
repository, thus preventing syncing errors.  Or, in some cases, users may also be able to make a secondary request to delete their photos on even the central repository, but there may be a pre-determined time that data must remain on the server (e.g. 24
hours or 48 hours).  Although the example interface 330 includes an explicit photo request 332, the requested data type may be clear from the context, for example, in a photo sharing game.  There are multiple channels where a user can select a data type,
such as a photo, to send as a photo response.  For example, new photos may be taken if the particular hardware has a built-in camera.  This interface may be situated directly in the game application.  Alternatively, the game application may access the
photo repository or album of the built-in camera if photos are taken in alternative locations.  In another example embodiment, stock photos may already be provided to a user to provide as a photo response.  Similarly, users may also be able to purchase
sets of stock photos.  When the data is sent, the application may pre-compress the image in order to conserve bandwidth as well as storage space on client devices.  For example, images may be converted into thumbnails, or, if the data type is a music
file, the image may be converted from a larger WAV file to an MP3 file.  In addition to storing photos, the system may also act as a filter.  For example, in the example embodiment of a photo sharing game, photos taken or sent may be pornographic or
illegal in nature if sent to certain underage individuals.  Or, there may be links to images sent to underage individuals.  Therefore, in some example embodiments, links may be checked against a whitelist or blacklist to determine if there is illegal or
otherwise undesirable content.  Alternatively, image recognition may be used to determine whether images are likely to be illegal or otherwise undesirable.
<br/><br/> The winning response values may by selected by the player who originally sent the request or from a broader group.  FIG. 6 shows an example method 340 of selecting the winning response including sending response values from at least some of the
response messages to the user who originally sent the request 342 and receiving the selection of the winning response values from that user 344.  FIG. 7 shows an example method 350 of selecting the winning response including receiving a second
distribution list, which may be identical with the original distribution list or a subset thereof 352.  The method 350 then includes sending response values from at least some of the response messages to the users in the second distribution list with a
request to vote for the winning response values 354, receiving voting messages from the users in the second distribution list, where each voting message includes a vote for the selection of the wining response values 356, and determining the winning
response values from the received votes 358 (e.g., according to the most votes).
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 shows a portion 360 of a user interface for choosing (e.g., by mouse click) the winning response to John's request 334 for a photo match to the word "happy." In this embodiment, there are three choices illustrated here as happy faces (or
smileys), one for Player #1 362, one for Player #2 364, and one for Player #3 366.  The choices are listed by player number so that the selection can be made without reference to the source of the submission.
<br/><br/> The embodiments shown in FIGS. 5 and 8 correspond to examples where the request includes text data and the requested response includes image data.  However, other examples in accordance with the data types shown in FIG. 3 are possible including
a text request and an audio response, an image request and a text response, an image request and an audio response, an audio request and a text response, and an audio request and an image response.  Text requests and responses may include one or two
words or a larger document or a reference to a document.  Image requests and responses may include photos or other graphical images or references to images.  Audio requests and responses may include recorded messages or songs or references to recordings. For example, a user may display a single photo to friends and elicit a text response that is a description of that photo, wherein the user selects the best description for that photo.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, requests and response may have associated time windows.  For example, after request messages have been sent, response messages may be due within a fixed time period (e.g., 1 day).  And the selection of the winning response
values may be similarly constrained.
<br/><br/> Additional embodiments relate to an apparatus for carrying out any one of the above-described methods (e.g., as a game mechanic), where the apparatus includes a computer for executing computer instructions related to the method.  In this context
the computer may be a general-purpose computer including, for example, a processor, memory, storage, and input/output devices (e.g., keyboard, display, disk drive, Internet connection, etc.).  However, the computer may include circuitry or other
specialized hardware for carrying out some or all aspects of the method.  In some operational settings, the apparatus or computer may be configured as a system that includes one or more modular units, each of which is configured to carry out some aspects
of the method either in software, in hardware or in some combination thereof.  For example, the system may be configured as part of a computer network that includes the Internet.  At least some values for the results of the method can be saved for later
use in a computer-readable medium, including memory units (e.g., RAM (Random Access Memory), ROM (Read Only Memory)) and storage devices (e.g., hard-disk systems, optical storage systems).
<br/><br/> Additional embodiments also relate to a computer-readable medium that stores (e.g., tangibly embodies) a computer program for carrying out any one of the above-described methods by means of a computer.  The computer program may be written, for
example, in a general-purpose programming language (e.g., C, C++) or some specialized application-specific language.  The computer program may be stored as an encoded file in some useful format (e.g., binary, ASCII).  In some contexts, the
computer-readable medium may be alternatively described as a computer-useable medium, a computer-storage medium, a computer-program medium, machine-readable medium or some alternative non-transitory storage medium.  Depending on the operational setting,
specified values for the above-described methods may correspond to input files for the computer program or computer.
<br/><br/> Data Flow
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 illustrates an example data flow between the components of system 500.  In particular embodiments, system 500 can include client system 530, social networking system 520a, and game networking system 520b.  The components of system 500 can
be connected to each other in any suitable configuration and using any suitable type of connection.  The components may be connected directly or over any suitable network.  Client system 530, social networking system 520a, and game networking system 520b
can each have one or more corresponding data stores such as local data store 525, social data store 545, and game data store 565, respectively.  Social networking system 520a and game networking system 520b can also have one or more servers that can
communicate with client system 530 over an appropriate network.  Social networking system 520a and game networking system 520b can have, for example, one or more Internet servers for communicating with client system 530 via the Internet.  Similarly,
social networking system 520a and game networking system 520b can have one or more mobile servers for communicating with client system 530 via a mobile network (e.g., Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Personal Communications Service (PCS),
Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN), Wi-Fi, etc.).  In some embodiments, one server may be able to communicate with client system 530 over both the Internet and a mobile network.  In other embodiments, separate servers can be used.
<br/><br/> Client system 530 can receive and transmit data 523 to and from game networking system 520b.  This data can include, for example, webpages, messages, game inputs, game displays, HTTP packets, data requests, transaction information, updates, and
other suitable data.  At some other time, or at the same time, game networking system 520b can communicate data 543, 547 (e.g., game state information, game system account information, page info, messages, data requests, updates, etc.) with other
networking systems, such as social networking system 520a (e.g., <b><i>FACEBOOK,</i></b> MYSPACE, etc.).  Client system 530 can also receive and transmit data 527 to and from social networking system 520a.  This data can include, for example, webpages, messages,
social graph information, social network displays, HTTP packets, data requests, transaction information, updates, and other suitable data.
<br/><br/> Communication between client system 530, social networking system 520a, and game networking system 520b can occur over any appropriate electronic communication medium or network using any suitable communications protocols.  For example, client
system 530, as well as various servers of the systems described herein, may include Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networking stacks to provide for datagram and transport functions.  Of course, any other suitable network and
transport layer protocols can be utilized.
<br/><br/> In addition, hosts or end-systems described herein may use a variety of higher layer communications protocols, including client-server (or request-response) protocols, such as the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  Other communications
protocols, such as HTTP Secure (HTTP-S), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Telnet, and a number of other protocols, may also be used.  In addition, a server in one interaction context may be a client in another
interaction context.  In particular embodiments, the information transmitted between hosts may be formatted as HyperText Markup Language (HTML) documents.  Other structured document languages or formats can be used, such as Extensible Markup Language
(XML), and the like.  Executable code objects, such as JavaScript and ActionScript, can also be embedded in the structured documents.
<br/><br/> In some client-server protocols, such as the use of HTML over HTTP, a server generally transmits a response to a request from a client.  The response may comprise one or more data objects.  For example, the response may comprise a first data
object, followed by subsequently transmitted data objects.  In particular embodiments, a client request may cause a server to respond with a first data object, such as an HTML page, which itself refers to other data objects.  A client application, such
as a browser, will request these additional data objects as it parses or otherwise processes the first data object.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, an instance of an online game can be stored as a set of game state parameters that characterize the state of various in-game objects, such as, for example, player character state parameters, non-player character
parameters, and virtual item parameters.  In particular embodiments, a game state is maintained in a database as a serialized, unstructured string of text data as a so-called Binary Large Object (BLOB).  When a player accesses an online game on game
networking system 520b, the BLOB containing the game state for the instance corresponding to the player can be transmitted to client system 530 for processing by a client-side executable object.  In particular embodiments, the client-side executable may
be a FLASH-based game, which can de-serialize the game state data in the BLOB.  As a player plays the game, the game logic implemented at client system 530 maintains and modifies the various game state parameters locally.  The client-side game logic may
also batch game events, such as mouse clicks, and transmit these events to game networking system 520b.  Game networking system 520b may itself operate by retrieving a copy of the BLOB from a database or an intermediate memory cache (memcache) layer. 
Game networking system 520b can also de-serialize the BLOB to resolve the game state parameters and execute its own game logic based on the events in the batch file of events transmitted by the client to synchronize the game state on the server side. 
Game networking system 520b may then re-serialize the game state, now modified, into a BLOB and pass this to a memory cache layer for lazy updates to a persistent database.
<br/><br/> With a client-server environment in which the online games may run, one server system, such as game networking system 520b, may support multiple client systems 530.  At any given time, there may be multiple players at multiple client systems 530
all playing the same online game.  In practice, the number of players playing the same game at the same time may be very large.  As the game progresses with each player, multiple players may provide different inputs to the online game at their respective
client systems 530, and multiple client systems 530 may transmit multiple player inputs and/or game events to game networking system 520b for further processing.  In addition, multiple client systems 530 may transmit other types of application data to
game networking system 520b.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a computer-implemented game may be a text-based or turn-based game implemented as a series of web pages that are generated after a player selects one or more actions to perform.  The web pages may be displayed in a
browser client executed on client system 530.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a client application downloaded to client system 530 may operate to serve a set of webpages to a player.  As another example and not by way of limitation, a
computer-implemented game may be an animated or rendered game executable as a stand-alone application or within the context of a webpage or other structured document.  In particular embodiments, the computer-implemented game may be implemented using
Adobe Flash-based technologies.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a game may be fully or partially implemented as a SWF object that is embedded in a web page and executable by a Flash media player plug-in. In particular embodiments, one or
more described webpages may be associated with, or accessed by, social networking system 520a.  This disclosure contemplates using any suitable application for the retrieval and rendering of structured documents hosted by any suitable network-addressable
resource or website.
<br/><br/> Application event data of a game is any data relevant to the game (e.g., player inputs).  In particular embodiments, each application datum may have a name and a value, and the value of the application datum may change (i.e., be updated) at any
time.  When an update to an application datum occurs at client system 530, either caused by an action of a game player or by the game logic itself, client system 530 may need to inform game networking system 520b of the update.  For example, if the game
is a farming game with a harvest mechanic (such as Zynga FarmVille), an event can correspond to a player clicking on a parcel of land to harvest a crop.  In such an instance, the application event data may identify an event or action (e.g., harvest) and
an object in the game to which the event or action applies.  For illustration purposes and not by way of limitation, system 500 is discussed in reference to updating a multi-player online game hosted on a network-addressable system (such as, for example,
social networking system 520a or game networking system 520b), where an instance of the online game is executed remotely on a client system 530, which then transmits application event data to the hosting system such that the remote game server
synchronizes the game state associated with the instance executed by the client system 530.
<br/><br/> In a particular embodiment, one or more objects of a game may be represented as an Adobe Flash object.  Flash may manipulate vector and raster graphics, and supports bidirectional streaming of audio and video.  "Flash" may mean the authoring
environment, the player, or the application files.  In particular embodiments, client system 530 may include a Flash client.  The Flash client may be configured to receive and run the Flash application or game object code from any suitable networking
system (such as, for example, social networking system 520a or game networking system 520b).  In particular embodiments, the Flash client may be run in a browser client executed on client system 530.  A player can interact with Flash objects using client
system 530 and the Flash client.  The Flash objects can represent a variety of in-game objects.  Thus, the player may perform various in-game actions on various in-game objects by making various changes and updates to the associated Flash objects.  In
particular embodiments, in-game actions can be initiated by clicking or similarly interacting with a Flash object that represents a particular in-game object.  For example, a player can interact with a Flash object to use, move, rotate, delete, attack,
shoot, or harvest an in-game object.  This disclosure contemplates performing any suitable in-game action by interacting with any suitable Flash object.  In particular embodiments, when the player makes a change to a Flash object representing an in-game
object, the client-executed game logic may update one or more game state parameters associated with the in-game object.  To ensure synchronization with the Flash object shown to the player at client system 530, the Flash client may send the events that
caused the game state changes to the in-game object to game networking system 520b.  However, to expedite the processing and hence the speed of the overall gaming experience, the Flash client may collect a batch of some number of events or updates into a
batch file.  The number of events or updates may be determined by the Flash client dynamically or determined by game networking system 520b based on server loads or other factors.  For example, client system 530 may send a batch file to game networking
system 520b whenever 50 updates have been collected or after a threshold period of time, such as every minute.
<br/><br/> As used herein, the term "application event data" may refer to any data relevant to a computer-implemented game application that may affect one or more game state parameters, including, for example and without limitation, changes to player data
or metadata, changes to player social connections or contacts, player inputs to the game, and events generated by the game logic.  In particular embodiments, each application datum may have a name and a value.  The value of an application datum may
change at any time in response to the game play of a player or in response to the game engine (e.g., based on the game logic).  In particular embodiments, an application data update occurs when the value of a specific application datum is changed.  In
particular embodiments, each application event datum may include an action or event name and a value (such as an object identifier).  Thus, each application datum may be represented as a name-value pair in the batch file.  The batch file may include a
collection of name-value pairs representing the application data that have been updated at client system 530.  In particular embodiments, the batch file may be a text file, and the name-value pairs may be in string format.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, when a player plays an online game on client system 530, game networking system 520b may serialize all the game-related data, including, for example and without limitation, game states, game events, and user inputs,
for this particular user and this particular game into a BLOB and store the BLOB in a database.  The BLOB may be associated with an identifier that indicates that the BLOB contains the serialized game-related data for a particular player and a particular
online game.  In particular embodiments, while a player is not playing the online game, the corresponding BLOB may be stored in the database.  This enables a player to stop playing the game at any time without losing the current state of the game that
the player is in. When a player resumes playing the game next time, game networking system 520b may retrieve the corresponding BLOB from the database to determine the most-recent values of the game-related data.  In particular embodiments, while a player
is playing the online game, game networking system 520b may also load the corresponding BLOB into a memory cache so that the game system may have faster access to the BLOB and the game-related data contained therein.
<br/><br/> Systems and Methods
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, one or more described webpages may be associated with a networking system or networking service.  However, alternate embodiments may have application to the retrieval and rendering of structured documents hosted by any
type of network addressable resource or web site.  Additionally, as used herein, a user may be an individual, a group, or an entity (such as a business or third party application).
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may operate in a wide area network environment, such as the Internet, including multiple network addressable systems.  FIG. 10 illustrates an example network environment 600 in which various example embodiments may
operate.  Network cloud 660 generally represents one or more interconnected networks, over which the systems and hosts described herein can communicate.  Network cloud 660 may include packet-based wide area networks (such as the Internet), private
networks, wireless networks, satellite networks, cellular networks, paging networks, and the like.  As FIG. 10 illustrates, particular embodiments may operate in a network environment comprising one or more networking systems, such as social networking
system 620a, game networking system 620b, and one or more client systems 630.  The components of social networking system 620a and game networking system 620b operate analogously; as such, hereinafter they may be referred to simply as networking system
620.  Client systems 630 are operably connected to the network environment via a network service provider, a wireless carrier, or any other suitable means.
<br/><br/> Networking system 620 is a network addressable system that, in various example embodiments, comprises one or more physical servers 622 and data stores 624.  The one or more physical servers 622 are operably connected to network cloud 660 via, by
way of example, a set of routers and/or networking switches 626.  In an example embodiment, the functionality hosted by the one or more physical servers 122 may include web or HTTP servers, and FTP servers, as well as, without limitation, webpages and
applications implemented using Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script, PHP Hyper-text Preprocessor (PHP), Active Server Pages (ASP), HTML, XML, Java, JavaScript.  Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), Flash.  ActionScript, and the like.
<br/><br/> Physical servers 622 may host functionality directed to the operations of networking system 620.  Hereinafter servers 622 may be referred to as server 622, although server 622 may include numerous servers hosting, for example, networking system
620, as well as other content distribution servers, data stores, and databases.  Data store 624 may store content and data relating to, and enabling, operation of networking system 620 as digital data objects.  A data object, in particular embodiments,
is an item of digital information typically stored or embodied in a data file, database, or record.  Content objects may take many forms, including: text (e.g., ASCII, Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), HTML), images (e.g., jpeg, tif and gil),
graphics (vector-based or bitmap), audio, video (e.g., mpeg), or other multimedia, and combinations thereof.  Content object data may also include executable code objects (e.g., games executable within a browser window or frame), podcasts, and so forth. 
Logically, data store 624 corresponds to one or more of a variety of separate and integrated databases, such as relational databases and object-oriented databases, that maintain information as an integrated collection of logically related records or
files stored on one or more physical systems.  Structurally, data store 624 may generally include one or more of a large class of data storage and management systems.  In particular embodiments, data store 624 may be implemented by any suitable physical
system(s) including components, such as one or more database servers, mass storage media, media library systems, storage area networks, data storage clouds, and the like.  In one example embodiment, data store 624 includes one or more servers, databases
(e.g., MySQL), and/or data warehouses.  Data store 624 may include data associated with different networking system 620 users and/or client systems 630.
<br/><br/> Client system 630 is generally a computer or computing device including functionality for communicating (e.g., remotely) over a computer network.  Client system 630 may be a desktop computer, laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA),
in- or out-of-car navigation system, smart phone or other cellular or mobile phone, or mobile gaming device, among other suitable computing devices.  Client system 630 may execute one or more client applications, such as a web browser, to access and view
content over a computer network.  In particular embodiments, the client applications allow a user of client system 630 to enter addresses of specific network resources to be retrieved, such as resources hosted by networking system 620.  These addresses
can be Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and the like.  In addition, once a page or other resource has been retrieved, the client applications may provide access to other pages or records when the user "clicks" on hyperlinks to other resources.  By way of
example, such hyperlinks may be located within the webpages and provide an automated way for the user to enter the URL of another page and to retrieve that page.
<br/><br/> A webpage or resource embedded within a webpage, which may itself include multiple embedded resources, may include data records, such as plain textual information, or more complex digitally encoded multimedia content, such as software programs
or other code objects, graphics, images, audio signals, videos, and so forth.  One prevalent markup language for creating webpages is HTML.  Other common web browser-supported languages and technologies include XML, the Extensible Hypertext Markup
Language (XHTML), JavaScript, Flash, ActionScript, Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), and, frequently, Java.  By way of example, HTML enables a page developer to create a structured document by denoting structural semantics for text and links, as well as
images, web applications, and other objects that can be embedded within the page.  Generally, a webpage may be delivered to a client as a static document; however, through the use of web elements embedded in the page, an interactive experience may be
achieved with the page or a sequence of pages.  During a user session at the client, the web browser interprets and displays the pages and associated resources received or retrieved from the website hosting the page, as well as, potentially, resources
from other websites.
<br/><br/> When a user at a client system 630 desires to view a particular webpage (hereinafter also referred to as target structured document) hosted by networking system 620, the user's web browser, or other document rendering engine or suitable client
application, formulates and transmits a request to networking system 620.  The request generally includes a URL or other document identifier as well as metadata or other information.  By way of example, the request may include information identifying the
user, such as a user ID, as well as information identifying or characterizing the web browser or operating system running on the user's client computing device 630.  The request may also include location information identifying a geographic location of
the user's client system or a logical network location of the user's client system.  The request may also include a timestamp identifying when the request was transmitted.
<br/><br/> Although the example network environment described above and illustrated in FIG. 10 described with respect to social networking system 620a and game networking system 620b, this disclosure encompasses any suitable network environment using any
suitable systems.  As an example and not by way of limitation, the network environment may include online media systems, online reviewing systems, online search engines, online advertising systems, or any combination of two or more such systems.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 illustrates an example computing system architecture, which may be used to implement a server 622 or a client system 630.  In one embodiment, hardware system 700 comprises a processor 702, a cache memory 704, and one or more executable
modules and drivers, stored on a tangible computer readable medium, and directed to the functions described herein.  Additionally, hardware system 700 may include a high performance input/output (I/O) bus 706 and a standard I/O bus 708.  A host bridge
710 may couple processor 702 to high performance I/O bus 706, whereas I/O bus bridge 712 couples the two buses 706 and 708 to each other.  A system memory 714 and one or more network/communication interfaces 716 may couple to bus 706.  Hardware system
700 may further include video memory (not shown) and a display device coupled to the video memory.  Mass storage 718 and I/O ports 720 may couple to bus 708.  Hardware system 700 may optionally include a keyboard, a pointing device, and a display device
(not shown) coupled to bus 708.  Collectively, these elements are intended to represent a broad category of computer hardware systems, including but not limited to general purpose computer systems based on the x86-compatible processors manufactured by
Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., and the x86-compatible processors manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif., as well as any other suitable processor.
<br/><br/> The elements of hardware system 700 are described in greater detail below.  In particular, network interface 716 provides communication between hardware system 700 and any of a wide range of networks, such as an Ethernet (e.g., IEEE 802.3)
network, a backplane, and so forth.  Mass storage 718 provides permanent storage for the data and programming instructions to perform the above-described functions implemented in servers 622, whereas system memory 714 (e.g., DRAM) provides temporary
storage for the data and programming instructions when executed by processor 702.  I/O ports 720 are one or more serial and/or parallel communication ports that provide communication between additional peripheral devices, which may be coupled to hardware
system 700.
<br/><br/> Hardware system 700 may include a variety of system architectures, and various components of hardware system 700 may be rearranged.  For example, cache 704 may be on-chip with processor 702.  Alternatively, cache 704 and processor 702 may be
packed together as a "processor module," with processor 702 being referred to as the "processor core." Furthermore, certain embodiments of the present disclosure may not require nor include all of the above components.  For example, the peripheral
devices shown coupled to standard I/O bus 708 may couple to high performance I/O bus 706.  In addition, in some embodiments, only a single bus may exist, with the components of hardware system 700 being coupled to the single bus.  Furthermore, hardware
system 700 may include additional components, such as additional processors, storage devices, or memories.
<br/><br/> An operating system manages and controls the operation of hardware system 700, including the input and output of data to and from software applications (not shown).  The operating system provides an interface between the software applications
being executed on the system and the hardware components of the system.  Any suitable operating system may be used, such as the LINUX Operating System, the Apple Macintosh Operating System, available from Apple Computer Inc.  of Cupertino, Calif., UNIX
operating systems, Microsoft.RTM.  Windows.RTM.  operating systems, Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) operating systems, and the like.  Of course, other embodiments are possible.  For example, the functions described herein may be implemented in
firmware or on an application-specific integrated circuit.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, the above-described elements and operations can be comprised of instructions that are stored on non-transitory storage media.  The instructions can be retrieved and executed by a processing system.  Some examples of instructions are
software, program code, and firmware.  Some examples of non-transitory storage media are memory devices, tapes, disks, integrated circuits, and servers.  The instructions are operational when executed by the processing system to direct the processing
system to operate in accordance with the disclosure.  The term "processing system" refers to a single processing device or a group of inter-operational processing devices.  Some examples of processing devices are integrated circuits and logic circuitry. 
Those skilled in the art are familiar with instructions, computers, and storage media.
<br/><br/>CONCLUSION
<br/><br/> Although only certain embodiments have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible without materially departing from the novel teachings of this disclosure.  For example,
aspects of embodiments disclosed above can be combined in other combinations to form additional embodiments.  Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this disclosure.
<br/><br/> A recitation of "a", "an," or "the" is intended to mean "one or more" unless specifically indicated to the contrary.  In addition, it is to be understood that functional operations, such as "awarding," "locating," "permitting," and the like, are
executed by game application logic that accesses, and/or causes changes to, various data attribute values maintained in a database or other memory.  Unless specifically indicated to the contrary, ordinal identifiers such as "first" and "second" are used
herein for labeling purposes only and are not intended to denote any specific spatial or temporal ordering.  Furthermore, the labeling of a "first" element does not imply the presence of a "second" element.
<br/><br/> The present disclosure encompasses all changes, substitutions, variations, alterations, and modifications to the example embodiments herein that a person having ordinary skill in the art would comprehend.  Similarly, where appropriate, the
appended claims encompass all changes, substitutions, variations, alterations, and modifications to the example embodiments herein that a person having ordinary skill in the art would comprehend.
<br/><br/> For example, the methods, game features and game mechanics described herein may be implemented using hardware components, software components, and/or any combination thereof.  By way of example, while embodiments of the present disclosure have
been described as operating in connection with a networking website, various embodiments of the present disclosure can be used in connection with any communications facility that supports web applications.  Furthermore, in some embodiments the term "web
service" and "website" may be used interchangeably and additionally may refer to a custom or generalized Application Programming Interface (API) on a device, such as a mobile device (e.g., cellular phone, smart phone, personal Global Positioning System
(GPS), PDA, personal gaming device, etc.), that makes API calls directly to a server.  The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.  It will, however, be evident that various
modifications and changes may be made thereunto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the disclosure as set forth in the claims and that the disclosure is intended to cover all modifications and equivalents within the scope of the
following claims.
