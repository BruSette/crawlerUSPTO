       <p> Aspects of the disclosure provide a computer-implemented method and
     system for the assignment of roadside assistance service providers such
     as tow trucks to distressed vehicles/drivers requiring roadside
     assistance. The methods and systems may include a roadside assistance
     service provider system with a collection module, an assignment module,
     and a feedback module. The collection module collects roadside assistance
     service provider information and historical statistics from real-world
     information and stores the information in a database that may then be
     analyzed using particular rules and formulas. The assignment module
     assigns particular roadside assistance service providers to particular
     distressed vehicles/drivers based on one or more characteristics. The
     feedback module may provide near real-time cues to the tow truck driver's
     mobile device, such as alerting when the amount of time spent on a task
     exceeds a predefined threshold, flagging high priority tasks/assignments,
     providing a step-by-step checklist for the repair.

<br/><br/> The disclosure relates generally to methods and systems for mobile or online service providers.  More specifically, the disclosure provides computer-implemented methods and systems that relates to the assignment of a roadside assistance service
provider to distressed vehicles/drivers requiring roadside assistance.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Services provided to users, such as roadside assistance services, automobile services, home services, and other personal services, are traditionally serviced through professional service providers that can be expensive and difficult to schedule. Specifically, roadside assistance service providers provide towing services, flat tire assistance, fuel services, automobile repairs, oil changes, and scheduled maintenance appointments, etc. Most prior art systems might auto assign roadside assistance
service providers or tow truck drivers solely based on the proximity to a distressed vehicle.  Telematics devices are known and used in the art to provide various telematics information to users and/or service providers regarding their location,
direction of travel, velocity, route, and/or destination.  Additionally, there is a vast wealth of insurance information that includes locations and instances for previous accidents, previous insurance claims, and driving history.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide roadside assistance service provider systems and methods for safe and effective service requests and assigning using a system that takes a sophisticated approach to collecting various types of data
through sensors and systems, analyzes that data, and assigns roadside assistance service providers based on a complex plurality of factors/characteristics for a more optimized assignment.  It would be desirable to include telematics information and
service provider information to locate the service providers based on the location of the services requested and to prioritize the service providers based on the user preferences, telematics information, additional factors, and insurance information of
the service providers

the service provider cannot find the user or the location of the service request, there is a service mismatch between what's ordered and what is needed, damaged property during the service, or the user complains that the service level agreement (SLA) is
not met.
<br/><br/> In another aspect of the invention, the mobile service provider system 100 may include capabilities in handling external special events.  Special events may be those external events that impact the overall service fulfillment.  Some example
special events may include: large number of service requests anticipating due to weather, historical patterns, special events such as games, New Year, etc.; and large anticipated service request that is too difficult to handle.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment in accordance with aspects of this invention, FIGS. 6 through 8 illustrate a roadside assistance service provider system 600 that may be utilized for the assignment of roadside assistance service providers, such as tow
trucks, to distressed vehicles/drivers requiring roadside assistance.  Though some prior art systems might automatically assign tow truck drivers based just on the proximity to a distressed vehicle, the roadside assistance service provide system 600
takes a more sophisticated approach to collecting various types of data through sensors and systems, analyzing that data, and assigning truck drivers based on a complex plurality of factors and characteristics for a more optimized assignment.  It is
understood to one skilled in the art that the embodiment described and disclosed above and in FIGS. 1-5 may be used together with these embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 6-8 and described below.
<br/><br/> Generally the roadside assistance service provider system 600 may include a collection module 610, an assignment module 620, and a feedback module 630.  In the collection module 610 (or gathering/collection module), sensors on a tow truck or
other similar vehicles (e.g. whether the flatbed is down, GPS location monitoring, etc.), smartphone user interfaces, and historical statistics about roadside assistance services (e.g. the historical average time for changing a flat tire, for jumping a
dead battery, etc.) may be collected from the real world and stored in a data store, then analyzed using particular rules and/or formats.  In the assignment module 620, particular roadside assistance service providers may be assigned to particular
distressed vehicles/drivers based on one or more characteristics, including characteristics/rules from the collection module 610.  For example, the assignment module 620 may match/assign a driver that only speaks Polish with a tow truck driver that
understands Polish.  Other characteristics/criteria utilized by the assignment module 620 may include proximity in location, prior user ratings, equipment on the tow truck, skillset/expertise of the driver of the tow truck, price/cost of the tow truck
roadside assistance services, etc. The feedback/display module 630 may provide near real-time cues to the tow truck driver's mobile device, such as alerting when the amount of time spent on a task exceeds a predefined threshold, flagging high priority
tasks/assignments, providing a step-by-step checklist for the repair, etc., and award points/score to the tow truck driver.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is an example block diagram of the roadside assistance service provider system 600 and a roadside assistance service provider server 605.  The roadside assistance service provider server 605 may include a variety of software or firmware
modules such as one or more of the following: a collection module 610, an assignment module 620, a feedback module 630, a reward module 640, and an insurance module 650.  Each of these modules may be utilized by the roadside assistance service provider
server 605.
<br/><br/> Generally, the collection module 610 collects roadside assistance service provider information from real-world and stores the information in a database 121 that may then be analyzed using particular rules and formulas.  The roadside assistance
service provider information may be collected from sensors on a tow truck or other vehicles, such as whether the flatbed is down, GPS location monitoring, etc. The roadside assistance service provider information may also be collected from smartphone
user interfaces.  Additionally, the collection module 610 may collect historical statistics about roadside assistance services, such as the historical average time for changing a flat tire, for jumping a dead battery, etc. Further, the collection module
610 may collect roadside assistance information.  The roadside assistance information may include and not be limited to: real-time equipment information, real-time GPS information, historical statistical data for various tasks and/or roadside assistance
services.  This roadside assistance information may then be stored in a database 121 and then analyzed using particular rules, formulas or other factors or characteristics.  The collection module 610 may be configured to do one or more of the following:
receive roadside assistance service request and collect information to verify roadside assistance service request criteria.
<br/><br/> The collection module 610 may allow and facilitate the user requesting services.  The requested services may include but not be limited to one or more of the following jobs or tasks: jump start automobile, flat tire change, tow automobile,
locked out of car, etc. The collection module 610 may also collect information to verify every new roadside assistance service request to ensure the request meets particular criteria.  For example, the collection module 610 may verify that the roadside
assistance service request or task is not currently assigned.  The collection module 610 may also verify that the roadside assistance service provider is not enrolled in auto-assignment.  The collection module 610 may also verify the roadside assistance
service providers that are logged-in and available.  Any driver or roadside assistance service provider logged into the roadside assistance service provider system 600 may be considered in the list of roadside assistance service providers for a given job
or task.  Additionally, the collection module 610 may be configured to provide a qualification, validation, or verification of a given roadside assistance service provider.  For example, the collection module 610 may qualify, validate, or verify the
roadside assistance service provider using the insurance information 665 as described and provided by the insurance server 660, such as safe driver information or current payment information.  This qualification, validation, and/or verification may
provide a pre-screening tool for the roadside assistance service providers to ensure a quality and safe roadside assistance service provider.
<br/><br/> The collection module 610 may also receive a registration by the roadside assistance service provider.  The registration may be via a mobile application, a web component, an internet form, an iOS form, a social media platform (<b><i>Facebook,</i></b> twitter,
google, etc.).  The registration may be via conventional means such as through a targeted offer or mailing sent in an email or letter.
<br/><br/> The collection module 610 may also include various sensors and other information regarding the vehicles and tow trucks.  For example, various sensors may be located on a tow truck or other vehicles.  The sensors may provide information such as
whether the flatbed is down, the GPS location, or other similar information.  The collection module 610 may be configured to receive, evaluate, and analyze a roadside assistance service provider's telematics information, such as location, velocity,
direction of travel, route, and destination, as well as the distressed vehicle's location, velocity, direction of travel, route, and destination.  Once a service is requested, the collection module 610 may also determine the amount of time for each task
for the requested roadside assistance service necessary for a given roadside assistance service provider, for example getting fuel will take 5 minutes for all drivers.  The collection module 610 may aggregate the time from many different drivers and
service providers.  The roadside assistance service provider system 600 and collection module 610 may learn from driver's or service provider's history as to the amount of time it takes to engage and complete a particular task.  This information may
later be utilized in the assignment module 615 in helping to assign the roadside assistance service provider to a roadside assistance service request.  Additionally, the collection module 610 may include various industry estimates for tasks and subtasks
for given roadside assistance services and this information may be utilized for driver customization during the assignment process with the assignment module 615.  Additionally, historical statistics about roadside assistance services such as the
historical average for a given task, such as changing a flat tire, or jumping a dead battery, etc, may be collected from the real world and stored in a database.  This information may then be analyzed using particular rules and formulas to determine the
roadside assistance service providers.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the collection module 610 may be configured to interface with one or more other roadside assistance service provider systems.  The collection module 610 may be configured to provide details of a given roadside assistance service
provider, such as location, services provided, roadside assistance service provider ratings, roadside assistance service provider reviews, etc. Additionally, the collection module 610 may be configured to provide real-time information about a given

estimates.  The assignment module 615 may also consider and factor the skill level and whether a driver or roadside assistance service provider is allowed and/or capable of working on a specific job or task, utilizing it as a qualifier.  The assignment
module 615 may also consider and factor the price of the driver, any particular skills of the driver, the match with the user or customer, and the equipment of the driver.  The assignment module 615 may also consider how long the driver will take at
their current job, utilizing information from the collection module 610.  The assignment module 615 may also consider weather, time of day, traffic, neighborhood, type of road, etc. which may cause the tasks onsite to take longer to perform.  The
assignment module 615 may also utilize driver performance as a factor in assignment of the next jobs and prioritize tasks at which a certain driver is strong.  Other factors and/or considerations may be utilized for assigning roadside assistance service
providers without departing from this invention.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the assignment module 615 may rank the roadside assistance service providers.  The rankings may be based on time, then by distance if there is a tie, and then by on time performance if there is still a tie.  Other rankings may be
utilized for the roadside assistance service providers without departing from this invention.  Following the rankings, the assignment module 615 may then send invitations and or assignments to the drivers or the roadside assistance service provider.  If
the driver accepts the invitation and assignment, the assignment module 615 may assign the roadside assistance service request to the driver.  If the driver does not accept the invitation and assignment, the assignment module 615 may send the roadside
assistance service request to the next driver or roadside assistance service provider on the list.  Additionally, if there is no assignment after a given time frame (for example 10 minutes), then the assignment module 615 may send the roadside assistance
service request back to a manual dispatcher for manual assignment.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the assignment module 615 may be utilized for reassignment of a roadside assistance service request.  During a reassignment, the assignment module 615 may shuffle the assignments during the middle of the assignment process. 
Current workloads may be shuffled as long as the driver or roadside assistance service provider is not yet at the roadside assistance site.  Various situations may trigger the reassignment.  One situation that may trigger a reassignment may be the
flagging of a roadside assistance service request as a priority roadside assistance service in which particular jobs may override other jobs and may be highlighted to dynamically reassign jobs.  One example of this priority flagging reassignment may be a
person stranded on a highway and needs attention immediately.  Another example of this priority flagging reassignment may be a person or distressed vehicle stranded in a dangerous location and needing attention immediately.  Another situation that may
trigger a reassignment may be the shifting of work to other roadside assistance service providers in a particular roadside assistance service provider is moving slowly during a given day.  In this instance, a centralized screen or output may be utilized
to show how different roadside assistance service providers are working and performing.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the assignment module 615 may facilitate and allow the user to view the service provider's specific information.  The service provider's specific information may include contact details and estimated time of arrival.  The service
provider's specific information may also include insurance information and verification data regarding the specific service provider.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the assignment module 615 may be configured to do one or more of the following: view service request, bid service request, provide confirmation for the service request, and send roadside assistance event notifications (service
start, en route, onsite, service complete, canceled service).  The assignment module 615 may allow and provide the service provider to view and bid on a service request.  The assignment module 615 may also allow and provide the service provider the
ability to send roadside assistance event notifications for various service events.  For example, the assignment module 615 may send an event notification confirming the service request.  The assignment module 615 may also send an event notification for
the start and completion of the service request.  The assignment module 615 may also send an event notification for other events such as the service provider is en route, the service provider is onsite, or the service provider has canceled the service
request.
<br/><br/> The assignment module 615 may further be configured to recommend or provide a ranked list of roadside assistance service providers based on various factors, such as preferred roadside assistance service providers, safest route, fastest route,
highest rated roadside assistance service providers, verified roadside assistance service providers, etc. The assignment module 615 may be in communication with the telematics device or in-vehicle device 225, wherein the telematics device 225 sends the
telematics information to the assignment module 615.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the assignment module 615 may further calculate and provide information regarding distance from nearest roadside assistance service provider to location of the service, time to travel (with or without traffic) from the roadside
assistance service provider to location of the roadside assistance service, route information for selected roadside assistance service providers, etc. Additionally, for example, through various driving telematics information devices may provide or know
the driving pattern of a user or a roadside assistance service provider.  The assignment module 615 may know that the roadside assistance service provider may be driving by the user (service requestor) on their way home from work or through one of their
known routes.  The assignment module 315 may know and track the routes of the roadside assistance service providers based on the telematics information and the insurance information.  The roadside assistance service provider request may be provided based

utilize driver performance as a factor in assignment of the next jobs and prioritize tasks at which a certain driver is strong.  Other factors and/or considerations may be utilized for assigning roadside assistance service providers without departing
from this invention.
<br/><br/> Additionally, in this step 815, the telematics information of the roadside assistance service providers and the user may be sent from a telematics device 225 located in the vehicle or as part of the mobile device 215.  The telematics information
may include information regarding the user and/or the customer's distressed vehicle.  The telematics information may also include information regarding the roadside assistance service provider and/or the roadside assistance service provider's vehicle. 
The telematics information may include information such as location, velocity (both instantaneous and/or average), direction of travel, route and final destination.  This telematics information may then be utilized to assist in providing further
information to the roadside assistance service provider system 600.  Utilizing telematics information and/or insurance information (driving habits), the roadside assistance service provider system 600 may know the driving routes and the known locations
of various roadside assistance service providers when the service request is made and may therefore match up given roadside assistance service providers who are located advantageously to the location that the roadside assistance services will be
performed.
<br/><br/> In step 820, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 may rank the roadside assistance service providers.  The rankings may be based on time, then by distance if there is a tie, and then by on time performance if there is still a tie. The rankings may also be based on any of the factors utilized during step 715.  Other rankings may be utilized for the roadside assistance service providers without departing from this invention.
<br/><br/> Following the rankings, in step 825, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 may then send invitations and or assignments to the drivers or the roadside assistance service provider.  If the driver accepts the invitation and
assignment, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 may assign the roadside assistance service request to the driver.  If the driver does not accept the invitation and assignment, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 may send
the roadside assistance service request to the next driver or roadside assistance service provider on the list.  Additionally, if there is no assignment after a given time frame (for example 10 minutes), then the roadside assistance service provider
system 600 may send the roadside assistance service request back to a manual dispatcher for manual assignment.
<br/><br/> In step 830, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 provides reassignment adjustments.  In this step 830, roadside assistance service provider system 600 may shuffle the assignments during the middle of the assignment process.  The
roadside assistance service provider system 600 may shuffle current workloads as long as the driver or roadside assistance service provider is not yet at the roadside assistance site.  Various situations may trigger the reassignment.  The roadside
assistance service provider system 600 may trigger a reassignment such as flagging of a roadside assistance service request as a priority roadside assistance service in which particular jobs may override other jobs and may be highlighted to dynamically
reassign jobs.  One example of this priority flagging reassignment may be a person stranded on a highway and needs attention immediately.  Another example of this priority flagging reassignment may be a person or distressed vehicle stranded in a
dangerous location and needing attention immediately.  Another situation that may trigger a reassignment may be the shifting of work to other roadside assistance service providers in a particular roadside assistance service provider is moving slowly
during a given day.  In this instance, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 provides a centralized screen or output to show how different roadside assistance service providers are working and performing.
<br/><br/> In step 835, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 provides roadside assistance event notifications for the roadside assistance services provided.  In step 835, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 may display and or
provide feedback for various events and tasks during the roadside assistance services.  In this step 835, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 may provide various service notifications from the service provider to the user.  The roadside
assistance service provider system 600 may provide the user with information regarding the status of the services, i.e. service confirmation, start time, service provider en-route, service provider onsite, service completed, and/or service canceled. 
Furthermore, in step 835, the roadside assistance service provider system 600, the feedback and display may provide near real-time cues to the tow truck driver's mobile device, such as alerting when the amount of time spent on a task exceeds a predefined
threshold, flagging high priority tasks/assignments, providing a step-by-step checklist for the repair, etc., performance measurements, and award points/score to the tow truck driver.
<br/><br/> In step 840, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 provides rewards based on the roadside assistance service provided.  In this step 840, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 may be configured to provide a reward to
an individual driver or roadside assistance service provider or roadside assistance service provider company if particular times are met.  For example, the reward may allow a driver to move up in a queue in a definitive way if the roadside assistance
service provider beats the estimate time or suggested times.  Additionally, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 may provide an individual driver or roadside assistance service provider an additional award if the job or tasks are done more
quickly.  The roadside assistance service provider system 600 may provide awards based on accurate estimates and not necessarily doing a job or task more quickly.
<br/><br/> In step 845, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 provides performance feedback for the roadside assistance service provider.  In this step 845, the roadside assistance service provider system 600 may also include a performance
output or screen, which displays to the driver whether the driver is within their estimated time of arrival for meeting their roadside assistance service request.  The roadside assistance service provider system 600 may also display or output to the
driver whether the driver's performance meets average performance as well as the driver's past performance for the given tasks or roadside assistance services.  The roadside assistance service provider system 600 may also calculate a performance score
based on the given tasks or roadside assistance services.  The roadside assistance service provider system 600 may output or display the driver's performance score that depends on the driver's ability to meet the timing of tasks as estimated or required. The roadside assistance service provider system 600 may also be able to identify a driver that performs weak at certain tasks for training the driver in those given tasks.
<br/><br/> According to some arrangements, the process described with respect to FIG. 8 may be provided by a roadside assistance service provider system 600, a mobile service provider application 602, or a service provider application executing on a device
such as a service provider's mobile communication device 215 or service provider server 605, through the internet or on a webpage, or a service provider's vehicle computer or navigation system.
<br/><br/> The processes, systems and other features described herein may be applied to all types of services.  For example, similar features and systems may be used to provide applications corresponding to automobile services, road services, home
services, and personal services.
<br/><br/> While the invention has been described with respect to specific examples and includes presently preferred modes of carrying out the invention, those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are numerous variations and permutations of the
above described systems and techniques that fall within the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
