       <p> Methods and systems are provided for creation and implementation of
     firewall policies. Method of the present invention includes enabling a
     firewall device to maintain a log of network traffic flow observed by the
     device. The method further includes enabling firewall device to receive
     an administrator request for a customized report to be generated based on
     log of network traffic and generating the report by extracting
     information from the log based on report parameters, where the report
     includes desired network traffic items that are associated with one or
     more action objects. The method further provides for firewall device to
     receive a directive to implement an appropriate firewall policy on one or
     more network traffic items responsive to interaction of administrator
     with one or more action objects corresponding to the network traffic
     items. Based on the directive and information from log, the firewall then
     defines and/or establishes appropriate firewall policy.

<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> 1.  Field
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to the field of computer networks.  In particular, various embodiments relate to systems and methods for improved and efficient firewall policy creation and management.
<br/><br/> 2.  Description of the Related Art
<br/><br/> The Internet is a network of networks and relates to a global collection of interconnected local, mid-level, wide area networks that use Internet Protocols as the network layer protocol.  As the Internet and its underlying technologies are
becoming increasingly popular, focus on Internet security and computer network security, in general, is also becoming a topic of growing concern.  For instance, growing access to unlimited information available on the Internet gives rise to an
opportunity to gain unauthorized access to data, which can relate to threats, such as modification of data, deletion of data, unauthorized use of computer resources, undesired interference with intended use of computer resources, among other such
threats.  Such threats give rise to development of techniques responsible for handling security of networks and computers served by those networks.
<br/><br/> A firewall, as one of the commonly used network security or access control mechanisms, is typically configured to shield data and resources from computer network intruders and create an electronic boundary that prevents unauthorized users from
accessing files or other content on a network or a computer.  A firewall may be provided at an edge of a network ("edge firewall") that interfaces with computers or resources outside the network and functions as a mechanism for monitoring and controlling
flow of data between resources within the network and those outside such that all communication, such as data packets, requests for web pages, request for specific information, which flows between the networks in either direction passes through firewall. A firewall can be configured to selectively permit communication from one network to another network or device so as to provide bi-directional security.
<br/><br/> A firewall is typically installed on or otherwise implemented by a computer or any other computing device for protecting against unsecured networks coupled thereto and is configured to monitor network traffic and filter content requests based on
a predetermined set of policies.  Such firewall policies may define one or more filtering criteria based on how an organization's firewalls should handle inbound and outbound network traffic for specific IP addresses and address ranges, protocols,
applications, and content types, through one or more rules, which protect the device or the network.  For instance, such criteria may result in the prevention of computers having certain IP addresses from accessing defined social networking websites or
secured databases.
<br/><br/> Each firewall policy is a list of ordered rules that define action to be taken on matching packets and help control access to and from the firewall and machines behind it.  For instance, meeting of a rule defined by a firewall can allow passing
of a packet at issue into or from the secure network, while non-compliance with the rule can cause the packet to be discarded.  Firewall policies are typically managed by a network administrator using a firewall management interface or any other
appropriate software that presents attributes or parameters of network resources and allows the administrator to put or remove restrictions on the usage of the resources for efficient flow of traffic and compliance with information security policies of
the organization.
<br/><br/> Existing firewall policy management systems require network administrators to have ability to comprehend various attributes of the network traffic including source interface, destination interface, source IP, destination IP, event ID,
importance, application details, port details, traffic details, timestamps, user details, source device details, destination device details, level of trust, source operating system details, virus scan level, and schedule, for them to be able to define
appropriate policies.  This, in turn, requires the network administrator to understand issues relating to network protocols, kinds of traffic, types of application, numbers of ports and use thereof, access controls and security configurations, among
others, which presume in-depth technical understanding of computer networks and also of information security needs of the company, as a result of which only a limited set of skilled people possessing the appropriate technical know-how are able to
effectively define and manage firewall policies.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, existing firewall policy management systems, by virtue of incorporating multiple interconnected network parameters and resource information, introduce significant complexity in the manner in which they are used and/or monitored. 
Such complexity makes it difficult to introduce changes in the policies as it may adversely impact other components of the system.  Existing systems also do not allow effective monitoring of specific resources and generation of accurate reports that are
easy to interpret.
<br/><br/> In view of the foregoing, there exists a need for systems and methods that can facilitate creation and management of firewall policies.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Methods and systems are described for creation and management of firewall policies in computer networks.  Each firewall policy includes a list of ordered rules, which define desired actions to be taken by a firewall on selected applications,
types of applications, users, or groups of users based on information security policies of the organization and/or based on the traffic pattern of network interactions.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, method of the present invention can be carried out by a system implemented within or coupled with a firewall or by any other appropriate person including a network administrator responsible for creation or management
of firewall policies.  The method includes enabling a firewall device to maintain a log of network traffic observed by the device by storing, for each network traffic flow, information such as bandwidth usage, source interface, destination interface,
source Internet Protocol (IP) address, destination IP address, event ID, importance, application details, port information, traffic details, timestamps, user details, source device details, destination device details, level of trust, source operating
system details, virus scan level, schedule, among other such information.
<br/><br/> The method further includes enabling firewall device to receive an administrator request for a customized and interactive report to be generated based on the log of network traffic.  Administrator request can include report parameters,
alternatively also referred to as input parameters hereinafter, such as specified time frame, specified user, specified user group, specified application, specified bandwidth, specified type of application, among other such parameters, which can help
retrieve desired information about network traffic or packets passing through the network.  Based on administrator request, firewall device generates a customized and interactive report by extracting information from log based on report parameters, where
the report can present desired network traffic items, for instance in an aggregate form corresponding to one or more traffic aggregation parameters such as a user, a group of users, a time frame, an application, a type of application, among other such
parameters.  Report can further include information such as total running time, total bandwidth usage, among other such information for each of network traffic item and also include an action object corresponding to each network traffic item.
<br/><br/> The method further provides for firewall device to receive a directive to implement an appropriate firewall policy on one or more network traffic items responsive to interaction between administrator and one or more action objects corresponding
network traffic items.  Based on the directive and information from log, firewall device can define and/or establish the appropriate firewall policy.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Methods and systems are described for creation and management of firewall policies in computer networks.  Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to methods and systems for improved and efficient firewall policy creation and
management.  Embodiments of the present invention allow efficient and user-friendly mechanisms and techniques for firewall policy creation, implementation, and management through a list of ordered rules, which define desired actions to be taken by a
firewall on selected applications or users based on organizational requirements, industry standards, network traffic pattern of network interactions, characteristics of packets flowing there through, among other attributes.  There is also a need for
methods and systems that do not require network administrator to understand technicalities of underlying networking hardware involved in network configurations, and instead allow users to use one or more action objects to control settings of network
traffic items and easier definition, creation, and deployment of policies.
<br/><br/> In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present invention.  It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that embodiments of the present invention

<br/><br/> Various methods described herein may be practiced by combining one or more machine-readable storage media containing the code according to the present invention with appropriate standard computer hardware to execute the code contained therein. 
An apparatus for practicing various embodiments of the present invention may involve one or more computers (or one or more processors within a single computer) and storage systems containing or having network access to computer program(s) coded in
accordance with various methods described herein, and the method steps of the invention could be accomplished by modules, routines, subroutines, or subparts of a computer program product.
<br/><br/> If the specification states a component or feature "may", "can", "could", or "might" be included or have a characteristic, that particular component or feature is not required to be included or have the characteristic.
<br/><br/> Although the present disclosure has been described with the purpose of creating and implementing firewall policies, it should be appreciated that the same has been done merely to illustrate the invention in an exemplary manner and any other
purpose or function for which the explained structure or configuration can be used, is covered within the scope of the present disclosure.
<br/><br/> Embodiments of present disclosure and their advantages are understood by reference to FIG. 1.  FIG. 1 is an exemplary network architecture conceptually illustrating a system 100 having computing devices 102, alternatively also referred to as
network appliances 102 hereinafter, for sending and receiving packets of network information from external networks 110 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> According to an embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary network architecture 100 having computing devices 102a, 102b, .  . . , 102n, collectively referred to as computing devices 102 hereinafter operatively coupled
to Internet 110 through one or more networking devices such as switches 104a and 104b, collectively referred to as switches 104 hereinafter, firewalls 106a and 106b, collectively referred to as firewalls 106 hereinafter, and routers 108a and 108b,
collectively referred to as routers 108 hereinafter.  Computing devices 102 can include personal computers, smart devices, web-enabled devices, tablet PC's, printers, hand-held devices, laptops, among other such devices that can request or receive data
packets of information from Internet 110 through use of multiple network devices.
<br/><br/> Although the present disclosure has been explained with reference to Internet 110, it should be appreciated that any appropriate network such as Intranet and Extranet can also be used for implementation of the present invention.  Furthermore,
the network configuration as illustrated in FIG. 1 is merely for illustration purposes and any other network device such as hub, gateway, and access points can also be suitably incorporated in the present invention.  It should further be appreciated that
multiple communication interfaces or ports can be made available for any of the network devices or computing devices.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in FIG. 1, computing devices 102a, 102b, and 102c are operatively coupled with switch 104a, which enables desired and efficient routing and management of incoming and outgoing traffic or data packets.  Switch 104a is connected
with firewall 106a, which functions as a mechanism for monitoring and controlling flow of data packets in the form of requests for web pages, request for specific information from/to computing devices 102a-c. Firewall 106a therefore controls the flow of
data packets that are passed from the computing devices 102a-c to Internet 110 and from Internet 110 to computing devices 102a-c based on type, kind, or other attributes of data packets.  Firewall 106a can in turn be coupled with router 108a that enables
routing of traffic from/to Internet 110.
<br/><br/> Similarly, as illustrated in FIG. 1, computing devices 102d, 102e, and 102f are operatively coupled with switch 104b, which enables desired and efficient routing and management of incoming and outgoing traffic or data packets.  Switch 104b is
connected with firewall 106b that controls flow of data packets that are passed from computing devices 102d-f to Internet 110 and from Internet 110 to computing devices 102d-f based on their type, kind, or other attributes.  Firewall 106b can in turn be
coupled with router 108b to enable routing of traffic from/to Internet 110.
<br/><br/> As mentioned above, network architecture as illustrated in FIG. 1 is merely an exemplary embodiment and multiple other configurations and/or networking devices can be incorporated in the architecture to serve the intended need of network and
traffic flow.  For instance, in an embodiment, all computing devices can be covered under a local area network (LAN), which is connected directly to a router and then to a firewall for access to Internet.  Furthermore, according to an embodiment,
firewall 106 can be installed on a computing device or within a network device, which may be equipped with an ability to trace traffic flow and network interactions.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates a network architecture 200 implementing firewall policy management system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  It should be appreciated that network configuration presented in FIG. 2 is merely for
illustration purpose and any other configuration by use of other or same network devices such as routers, switches, hubs, gateways, access controls, among other such devices can be incorporated.  According to one embodiment, computing devices 202a, 202b,
202c, and 202d, which relate to PC, Laptop, Mobile Phone, and Web Terminal respectively, can be connected via wired or wireless connections to a local area network (LAN) 204.  Computing devices can be collectively referred to as 202 and can include any
other device capable of sending and/or receiving data packets from a network.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, LAN 204 is connected to routing devices such as routers 206a and 206b, collectively referred to as router 206 hereinafter, which help route or manage traffic flowing from LAN 204 to external network.  Network
architecture 200 further includes a firewall 208 between computing devices 202 and external network, where firewall 208 acts as a network security or access control mechanism and is configured to shield data and resources from computer network intruders
and create an electronic boundary that prevents undesired flow of traffic or data packets between internal and external networks.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, firewall 208 comprises one or more policies that help regulate flow of traffic and control access of data/content/packets across internal network that it covers.  Each policy includes a set of rules that define
conditions based on which packets are transferred between networks, wherein such rules can either be automatically developed by a firewall software or can be set by a network/firewall administrator 210 based on organizational needs, strategic business
objectives, industry standards, desired communication policies, among other such factors.  Firewall policies can be implemented based on multiple parameters such as bandwidth usage, source interface, destination interface, source Internet Protocol (IP)
address, destination IP address, event ID, importance, application details, port information, traffic details, timestamps, user details, source device details, destination device details, level of trust, source operating system details, virus scan level,
and schedule, among other such parameters.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, firewall policy creation and implementation system of the present invention comprises configuration of a logging module 212, a report request receive module 214, a report generation module 216, a receive policy
module 218, and a policy implementation module 220 on firewall 208.  Each of these modules, although illustrated to be implemented within firewall 208, can be implemented and executed on any other device/system that is operatively coupled with firewall
208 and can help achieve the purpose of efficiently creating and implementing firewall policies.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, logging module 212 is configured to maintain a log of network traffic observed by firewall 208 by storing, for each network traffic flow, information such as bandwidth usage, source interface, destination interface,
source Internet Protocol (IP) address, destination IP address, event ID, importance, application details, port information, traffic details, timestamps, user details, source device details, destination device details, level of trust, source operating
system details, virus scan level, and schedule.  For instance, for each data packet that is received from a computing device 202, logging module 212 can store details of source interface, sender details, destination information stored in the packet,
bandwidth required for allowing packet to pass through, timestamp of transmission, among other attributes which can help determine all characteristics of the packet under consideration.
<br/><br/> Logging module 212 can be configured to be operatively coupled with a log database 222 that can either be stored within firewall 208 or in a device operatively coupled with firewall 208.  Log database 222 is configured to store all data logged
by module 212 for each network traffic flow, where the data can be stored in any easily accessible and retrievable format.  For instance, database 222 can be a relational database that stores multiple network attributes as fields of a network traffic
table and for each data packet, populates a row of the table with values of the attributes.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, report request receive module 214 is configured to receive a request from firewall administrator 210 for a customized and interactive report to be generated based on log stored in log database 222.  Request received
from administrator 210 identifies input report parameters such as specified time frame, specified user, specified user group, specified application, or specified type of application, among other such input parameters based on which report is to be
generated.  Such a report, being specific and targeted by means of the input parameters, can be used to retrieve focused information from log and help deduce a pattern of traffic flow to help administrator 210 take appropriate measures to create
efficient firewall policies that comply with organization/industry standards.
<br/><br/> In an instance, request received from administrator 210 can be a combination of input parameters such as the request can demand for a customized report for all social networking applications (such as <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> MySpace and LinkedIn) being used
between 5-7 PM by Human Resources Department of the concerned organization.  Such a request can automatically or manually be converted into a database query to retrieve relevant information from log database 222.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, report generation module 216 is configured to, based on input parameters received as part of request from administrator 210, generate customized and/or interactive report by extracting information from log stored in
log database 222.  Further, based on the input parameters, the report generation module 216 is configured to present one or more network traffic items in an aggregate form corresponding to one or more traffic aggregation parameters.  Traffic aggregation
parameters such as a user, a group of users, a time frame, an application, a type of application, among other such aggregation parameters can be used to enable module 216 to aggregate network traffic items that form part of the desired customized and/or
interactive report.  Network traffic items can include one or more traffic parameters such as bandwidth usage, source interface, destination interface, source Internet Protocol (IP) address, destination IP address, event ID, importance, application
details, port information, traffic details, timestamps, user details, source device details, destination device details, level of trust, source operating system details, virus scan level, schedule, among other such traffic parameters that are stored in
log for each network traffic flow.
<br/><br/> In an instance, considering that the request from administrator 210 relates to identifying network traffic flow for "Mike Shaw" between 10 AM and 6 PM, one way to generate a report would be to cumulate all requests and traffic parameters thereof
made by Mike Shaw along with all data packets and traffic parameters thereof received by Mike Shaw during the desired time period.  However, with numerous requests being issued or received each moment, it might become very cumbersome to analyse such a
report and derive a specific policy based on such analysis.  Therefore, in another embodiment, all transactions of Mike Shaw can be aggregated based on traffic aggregation parameters such as applications, application types, and time frame to arrive at a
more accurate and easily determinable conclusion.  For instance, categorization of network traffic flow into types of applications such as e-commerce applications, video applications, audio applications, online software applications, social networking
applications, mail exchange applications, among other such applications can provide efficiency and accuracy in analysis.  In the above instance therefore, a report can be generated mentioning use of <b><i>Facebook</i></b> by Mike Shaw for 2.5 hours with bandwidth
usage of 55 MB and use of video applications such as Youtube.com for 35 minutes with bandwidth usage of 45 MB.  Further details such as time of access, kind of videos being watched, among others can also be presented as desired by administrator 210.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, report generated by report generation module 216 is customizable and therefore further details, if desired, can be accessed by administrator 210 from the results provided in the report.  For instance, aggregated data
presented in the report can be broken down into individual network traffic flows or packet level details.  Similarly, in order to have a more abstract view of the network traffic pattern for the input parameters, existing network traffic items can
further be aggregated to implement high level firewall policies.  For instance, instead of application level aggregation that combines usage of each application such as tripadvisor.com, expedia.com, hotels.com, an application type aggregation can be used
to cumulate network traffic items based on travel as the application type.  Report can further configured to be interactive so as to allow administrator to interact with varied aggregated details and see a customized view of network traffic items
relating to input report parameters.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, report generated by report generation module 216 includes information identifying broad level indicators of network usage such as total running time, total bandwidth usage, total number of users exceeding allocated
bandwidth, time slot having maximum bandwidth usage, among other such indicators, where such information is presented based on input report parameters.  Presentation of such broad level indicators can assist in giving a starting point to initiate the
analysis of report.  For instance, once total bandwidth usage is known, user or group of users responsible for high usage of bandwidth can be identified, based on which application types or applications used by such user or group of users can be
retrieved and a policy can be defined based on such identified users, applications, time slots, and bandwidth usage patterns.
<br/><br/> According to another embodiment, each network traffic item can be associated with an action object such that administrator 210 can use action object to define policy on one or more network traffic items.  For instance, network traffic items can
include users, time periods, applications, and application types, each of which can be associated with an action object.  In such a case, an administrator can put constraints such as block certain applications for certain users at specific time periods
by means of action objects associated with the traffic items.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, receive policy module 218 is configured to receive a directive to implement an appropriate firewall policy for network traffic items, action objects of which have been changed or interacted upon by administrator 210. As discussed above, based on the report generated by report generation module 216, aggregated or non-aggregated network traffic items can be analysed by administrator 210 to check for compliance of one or more network traffic items with organizational
needs, industry standards, strategic business objectives, ethical requirements, among other attributes and use action objects to put constraints on desired traffic items and accordingly issue a directive that is received by receive policy module 218 of
firewall 208.  Directive can either be implemented on a user, a group of users, a department, or on the complete organization and can include multiple combinations of constraints such as a request to completely block flow of packet having specific
characteristics or set up a schedule for or setup a time limitation or bandwidth limitation for one or more network traffic items.  For instance, on one hand, access to <b><i>Facebook</i></b> can completely be blocked for R&amp;D Department, whereas on the other hand,
access to LinkedIn can be limited and scheduled for access only between 5:30 PM to 6 PM.  Bandwidth level limitations can include download of files up to a limit of 10 MB, wherein such limitations can change based on user in context, time of day, day of
week, among many other such factors.  Administrator 210 can also be allowed to issue multiple directives as and when desired or instructed based on organization level policy change such that multiple rules can be issued for implementation by firewall
208.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, directive can further include time frame during which network traffic item of which action object has been selected is permitted or prohibited or can include total amount of time during which one or more network
traffic items are permitted per day.  Directive can further be configured to include maximum amount of total bandwidth permitted per day for one or more network traffic items or can include maximum instantaneous bandwidth rate permitted at any given time
for one or more network traffic items.  Many other such combinations can be implemented to comply with desired firewall and network management requirements.
<br/><br/> Policy implementation module 220 can be configured to define and establish appropriate firewall policy based on directive issued by administrator 210.  According to one embodiment, one or more directives can be configured to be issued based on
interactions between administrator and one or more action objects of traffic items, and for each such directive, relevant interactions can identified and policies can be defined on the selected network traffic items.  Based on actions taken on selected
network traffic items, firewall policy can be configured to include blocking specified applications or specified types of applications.  Firewall policy can also include blocking specified applications or specified types of applications for specified
users or user groups.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, firewall policy can also include imposing time or bandwidth limitations on specified application or specified types of applications or imposing time or bandwidth limitations on specified applications or specified
types of applications by specified user or user groups.  According to yet another embodiment, firewall policy can further include imposing time or bandwidth limitations on specified users or user groups or include limiting use of specified application or
specified type of application to a particular time frame.  Firewall policies can also be configured to limit use of specified applications or types of applications to a particular time frame by specified user or user groups.  It should be appreciated
that any other combination of restrictions or permissions can be implemented on users, time periods, bandwidths, or applications, among other network traffic items as part of firewall policies based on interactions between administrator and action
objects associated with network traffic items.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary block diagram 300 of the proposed firewall policy management system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  According to one embodiment, system 300 comprises computing devices 302a and 302b,
collectively referred to as computing devices 302 hereinafter, which are operatively coupled to a gateway 304 that allows access or transfer of data packets from internal to external network 320 and visa-versa.  Gateway 304 is coupled with a firewall 306
to control flow of network traffic by implementing suitable rules and policies.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, firewall 306 is operatively accessible to a firewall administrator 316 that helps define, implement, and manage firewall policies for internal network having computing devices 302.  Firewall 306 includes an event log
312 that can either be stored on the firewall 306 in a log database 314 or on any other storage device operatively coupled to firewall 306.  Log 312 is configured to store information such as bandwidth usage, source interface, destination interface,
source Internet Protocol (IP) address, destination IP address, event ID, importance, application details, port information, traffic details, timestamps, bandwidth consumption, user details, source device details, destination device details, level of
trust, source operating system details, virus scan level, schedule, for each network traffic flow or data packet.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, in implementation, firewall administrator 316 requests for a customized and interactive report to be generated based on log 312 and further based on input report parameters.  Input parameters are used for refining
log 312 to generate a report that presents specific information on desired network traffic items such as users, schedule, applications, types of applications, among other such items.  Network traffic items 308 include traffic attributes on which or by
use of which constraints or restrictions can be imposed or removed.  Such network traffic items 308 include but are not limited to users, groups of users, schedules, applications, types of applications, bandwidths, flow direction, among other such
attributes.  Firewall sends the report generation request to report generator 310, which, based on input report parameters from administrator 316 and by means of log 312 and network traffic items 308 generates customized and interactive report by
extracting relevant information from log 312 based on the report parameters and presents one or more desired network traffic items.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, report is then analysed by administrator 316 to identify network traffic flow pattern and based on the analysis with respect to organizational requirements and business objectives, a directive is received by firewall
306 to implement an appropriate firewall policy for one or more network traffic items 308.  Firewall 306, based on the directive, defines and establishes appropriate firewall policy that is used to control traffic flow between internal and external
networks.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate a snapshot of an exemplary log 400 and a report 410 generated by proposed firewall policy management system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  As illustrated, log 400 can be maintained by a
firewall and include information characterizing network traffic flow such as bandwidth usage, source interface, destination interface, source Internet Protocol (IP) address, destination IP address, event ID, importance, application details, port
information, traffic details, timestamps, user details, source device details, destination device details, level of trust, source operating system details, virus scan level, schedule, among other such attributes.
<br/><br/> Log 400, as illustrated in FIG. 4A, is an exemplary snapshot presenting a subset of network traffic flow information and includes attributes user, source IP, destination IP, application, importance, port, duration, and usage.  As also
illustrated, log 400 can be maintained for all traffic flows received by firewall from internal or external networks and can include information of all users and their respective interactions, with highest usage, in FIG. 4A, being of 35 MB by Hans Yin
between 12 PM-14:30 PM by use of Minecraft application.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, in reference to FIG. 4B, using log 400 maintained by firewall, a report 410 can be generated based on a request received from firewall administrator, wherein the request includes report parameters such as specified
time frame, specified user, specified user group, specified application, specified type of application, among other such report parameters.  Exemplary report 410 of FIG. 4B has been generated with user "Kooby Yin" as a input report parameter so as to
enable the administrator to analyze all network interactions of the user and issue an appropriate directive based on the analysis.  For instance, as shown in FIG. 4B, Kooby Yin used Minecraft application for around 4 hours on 11/8 and over 2 hours on
11/9.  Based on an analysis of the network traffic flow for input report parameters, administrator can accordingly issue a directive to block or limit/schedule the usage of Minecraft application for Kooby Yin.
<br/><br/> It should be appreciated that FIGS. 4A and 4B show an exemplary and very simplistic representation of log 400 and report 410, which in reality would include numerous entries of network traffic flows spanning over days.  The proposed system can,
for such a log 400, by means of accurate input report parameters generate a report 410 through a desired selection of network traffic items and traffic aggregation parameters, allowing administrator an easy way to analyze network traffic items to be
acted upon and issue a directive by interacting with action objects of selected network traffic items.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates a screenshot 500 of the proposed firewall policy management system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  Screen 500 illustrates a report generated by report generation module of firewall and further
illustrates options of sorting or ordering network traffic items such as applications, traffic volume, user details, bandwidth consumed, identification attributes, percentage of memory consumed for each application, among other such items.  Report can
further include action objects for each network traffic item that allow firewall administrator to take one or more actions on the selected network traffic items.  As illustrated, screen 500 is presented with respect to applications and displays use of
multiple applications by one or more users and also presents attributes of usage such as time for which the application was used, traffic volume, bandwidth consumed, among other such attributes.
<br/><br/> Left pane of screen 500 illustrates different aggregation parameters that can help select the level of abstraction or customize the view of report for administrator to analyse different factors such as bandwidth usage, activities across time
intervals, user network interaction pattern, among other factors, and use such analysis to issue a directive to firewall for definition of policy.  As illustrated, screen 500 enables customized selection of network traffic items, where FIG. 5 shows
selection of "application" and "traffic volume" as traffic items and therefore the view presented in screen 500 shows applications (such as Minecraft, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> games, Skype, and Aim games) and users (Kooby Yin, Hans Yin, Echo Zhu, Alice Liu, Cathy Zhang)
using the applications at varied times.  Screen 500 also shows traffic volume used by each user during the time they used the application, which as a whole can enable administrator to take necessary action on one or more network terrific items.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 illustrates a screenshot 600 of the proposed firewall policy management system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  Screen 600 presents a report generated based on "identity" as the input report parameter where
identity refers to users, groups of users, departments, branch offices, among others entities that use network traffic flows for sending/receiving data packets.  As illustrated, display area of screen 600 includes multiple departmental groups such as
Financial, Engineering, that have been selected from a list groups such as financial, engineering, and sales as shown on left pane of screen 600.  As also illustrated, along with groups, individual users can also be selected based on input parameters
that are received by report request receive module.  In the present illustration, "Hans Yin" has been selected as the user and therefore display pane of screen 600 shows "Hans Yin" and details of traffic volume, percentage of bandwidth consumed, among
other traffic items to enable administrator to use corresponding action objects to issue a directive for policy definition.
<br/><br/> According to one embodiment, as discussed above, representation of each network traffic item can be aggregated based on traffic aggregation parameters such as user, group of users, time frame, application, bandwidth, type of application, among
other such parameters, which can help customize report layout and analyse only relevant and desired information.  Drop downs or any other such known mechanisms can be used to filter the level of details desired for viewing.  As illustrated, screen 600
can also be configured to present information on input parameters based on desired duration interval, which can be configured as shown on lower left pane of the report 600.  During analysis, apart from organizational requirement and other company wide
requirements, bandwidth usage based decisions can also be made to impose restrictions on users or groups of users.  For instance, in screen 600, user Kooby Yin uses the application Minecraft that consumes significantly more bandwidth/traffic volume when
compared with any other application, and therefore usage of Minecraft can either be blocked for Kooby Yin or can be restricted/allowed for a specified time interval.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 illustrates a screenshot 700 of the proposed firewall policy management system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  Screen 700 presents interaction between administrator and action objects of one or more network
traffic items.  As shown, based on analysis of report generated by firewall, administrator can select one or more network traffic items such as identity, schedule, bandwidth, applications, among other such traffic items on which action needs to be taken
for implementation of firewall policy.  Such actions can include blocking access of certain applications or types of applications for specified users or groups of users or departments.  Actions can further include controlling or restricting the direction
of flow of traffic, which include Any to Any, Internal to External Network, External to Internal Network, or can be customized based on ranges of IP addresses, among many other combinations.  As illustrated in screen 700, network traffic items include
identity of "Kooby Yin" and Application as "Minecraft", based on which further network traffic items such as schedule, flow direction, among others have been controlled.  As also illustrated, administrator interacts with action objects to block access of
Minecraft for Kooby Yin and restricts flow of data packets relating to this application in any direction (from Kooby Yin to the server of Minecraft or visa versa).
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 illustrates a screenshot 800 of the proposed firewall policy management system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  Screen 800 illustrates action objects corresponding to multiple network traffic elements such as
applications, identity, schedule, bandwidth, and flow direction, and further illustrates action being taken by administrator based on application "Minecraft".  As illustrated, administrator can select users, groups of users, or departments, or everyone
in the organization on which the policy is to be defined, such as "Anyone" has been selected in the present instance.  Once application and identity have been selected, access of application to identify can be defined in terms of traffic items such as
schedule, bandwidth, flow direction, among other items.  In the present example, access of Minecraft has been limited for all users of internal network to a traffic volume of 50 MB and only traffic from internal to external network has been permitted.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 illustrates a screenshot 900 of the proposed firewall policy management system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  Screen 900 illustrates an edit screen of firewall policies once such policies have been defined and
established in firewall.  As illustrated, screen 900 shows multiple existing and already implemented policies in a given firewall, each of which is associated with an edit button, the use of which can enable change of settings in terms of one or more
network traffic items.  For instance, as seen in display of screen 900, one policy relates to blocking all access of Minecraft to Kooby Yin, which through the present screen 900, if desired can be edited to enable limited access of the application to
Kooby Yin, say from 6 PM to 7 PM on Monday and Wednesday of each week.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 illustrates a screenshot 1000 of the proposed firewall policy management system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  Screen 1000 shows a display that is presented after edit button has been clicked on one or more
firewall policies.  As illustrated, screen 1000 looks similar to screens in FIG. 5-6 which allow setting of firewall policies based on action objects.  According to one embodiment, same or multiple different screens 1000 can be configured to change one
or more firewall policies as each policy focuses on different network traffic items.  Once an administrator is on screen 1000, one or more network traffic items including identity, application, duration/schedule, among others can be acted upon through
use of their corresponding action objects and existing policy can accordingly be modified or edited.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 1100 for firewall policy creation and implementation.  Method 1100 of the present system allows efficient evaluation of traffic flow pattern by an administrator without having to understand the
routing details or other technical/hardware aspects of network architecture.
<br/><br/> At block 1110, firewall maintains a log of network traffic for each data packet that is received by firewall from either external network or internal network, where the log includes information such as bandwidth usage, source interface,
destination interface, source Internet Protocol (IP) address, destination IP address, event ID, importance, application details, port information, traffic details, timestamps, user details, source device details, destination device details, level of
trust, source operating system details, virus scan level, schedule, among other such information.
<br/><br/> At block 1120, firewall receives an administrator request for a customized and interactive report to be generated based on the log of firewall.  Such a report is configured to include specific network traffic items that are retrieved based on
one or more input report parameters that form part of the administrator request.  Report parameters such as specified time frame, specified user, specified user group, specified application, specific bandwidth usage, specified type of application, among
other such parameters can be used to filter the log and generate the desired report based on which firewall policy is implemented.
<br/><br/> At block 1130, firewall generates the customized and interactive report by extracting information from log based on report parameters, where the report presents one or more network traffic items that are associated with action objects, using
which administrator can interact and impose restrictions on desired traffic items.  According to one embodiment, network traffic items that form part in the report are presented in aggregate form corresponding to one or more traffic aggregation
parameters such as user, group of users, time frame, bandwidth, traffic volume, application, type of application, among other such aggregation parameters.  According to another embodiment, report can further include broad level information such as total
running time and total bandwidth usage for each network traffic item.  Customized and interactive report can either be stored on firewall or on administrator's computing device or can be stored on any other storage device that is operatively coupled with
firewall and accessible to administrator.
<br/><br/> At block 1140, in response to action taken by administrator on action objects of one or more network traffic items, firewall receives a directive to implement an appropriate firewall policy for corresponding network traffic items.  According to
one embodiment, network traffic items can include attributes of network traffic flow that are stored in the log and as each item is associated with one or more action objects, administrator can, based on analysis of report, make necessary interaction
with desired action objects to put controls and restraints on one or more traffic items and accordingly issue a directive to firewall.
<br/><br/> At block 1150, firewall, based on directive and information from the log, is configured to define and establish appropriate firewall policy on the firewall.  Once defined and implemented, each policy can also be edited as and when desired by
controlling action objects of one or more network traffic items.
