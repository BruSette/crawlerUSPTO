</font><br/>
       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> A server rack with vertically stacked shelves is disclosed. The shelves
     are used for housing loads (e.g. servers) and power supply units. Thus,
     both the power supply units and the servers are vertically stacked in the
     rack. An array of vertical and horizontal busses is secured to the back
     side of the server rack to electrically couple the servers with the power
     supply units. The arrangement of the PSUs and the busses provides for
     uniform current density across the server rack. The devices placed on the
     shelves are accessible and serviceable from the front of the server rack.
     The server rack can be placed within or secured to a device, system or a
     server room in a vertical orientation, a horizontal orientation or at an
     angle.

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> The subject disclosure relates to server racks and more particularly to optimizing current distribution by reducing current density within a server rack.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Server racks are used to house multiple computer servers and other related loads, and to provide power and communication signals to them.  A server rack uses busses to distribute the current generated by power supply units (PSUs) to the loads
situated on various shelves of the server rack.  In conventional server rack architecture, the PSUs are located on either the top shelf or the bottom shelf of the server rack, and the current generated by them is distributed to the various loads by using
a vertical bus.  The vertical bus location closest to the PSUs is subjected to maximum current density.  The current density progressively decreases at vertical bus locations away from the PSUs.  Conventional server rack architecture requires oversized
busses that can support the maximum possible current density that can be generated by the PSUs.  Oversized busses are undesirable because they require more space and increased material costs than smaller busses.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> The following presents a simplified summary of the specification in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the specification.  This summary is not an extensive overview of the specification.  It is intended to neither identify
key or critical elements of the specification nor delineate any scope of particular aspects of the specification, or any scope of the claims.  Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the specification in a simplified form as a prelude to the more
detailed description that is presented later.
<br/><br/> According to an implementation of the subject disclosure, a server rack having vertically stacked shelves and vertically stacked PSUs is disclosed.  Two vertical busses are secured to the back side of the server rack and are located
substantially at the left and right sides of the server rack respectively.  Multiple horizontal busses, that are parallel to each other, are coupled between the two vertical busses.  Each horizontal bus is coupled to two PSUs and to one or more servers. 
The server rack as a whole can be oriented in a device, system or room vertically, horizontally or at an angle. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> Numerous aspects, implementations, objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters
refer to like parts throughout, and in which:
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a front view of a server rack, according to an implementation of the subject disclosure.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> Implementations of the subject disclosure are described below with references to the above drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout.  In the following description, for purposes of explanation,
numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the subject disclosure.  It is to be appreciated, however, that the subject disclosure can be practiced without these specific details.  In other instances,
well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the subject disclosure.
<br/><br/> As discussed herein, the terms N, N+1 and N+M are used herein according to their ordinary meanings.  Also, N, N+1 and N+M are used interchangeably herein.  M can be 0 or 1 or another integer number.  As discussed herein, components are coupled
to one another securely, hinged or removably.  Secure and hinged are used with their usual meanings.  Removable coupling includes any fastening that provides lateral stability without being permanently fixed.  For example, removably coupled components
can be removed using a single tool, such as a screwdriver.  In a nonlimiting implementation, removable coupling can include mere placement of a component on top of a shelf, whereby gravity and friction or physical objects such as other components provide
lateral stability.  In a nonlimiting implementation, removable coupling includes the use of a tray that slides.  Other nonlimiting examples of secure or removable coupling include adhesives, screws, clips, clamps, interference fits and pins.
<br/><br/> As discussed herein, hot swappable means the power supply units can be removed during continuous operation of the other components on the server rack.  By having components that are removably coupled, the server rack architecture disclosed
herein facilitates components being hot swappable.  As discussed herein, a load is a device that uses electrical power or communications from the server rack and is electrically coupled to other components on the server rack.  The terms server, load, and
component as used herein, are interchangeable.  In a nonlimiting implementation, a video monitor is the load.  In a non-limiting implementation, multiple servers or loads are placed on each shelf in a server rack.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary front view of a server rack 100.  The server rack 100 includes two side posts (105.sub.1 and 105.sub.2) which are vertically oriented and contain compartments for housing power supply units.  A first shelf
(110.sub.1) is securely coupled to and located toward the upper ends of the posts (105.sub.1 and 105.sub.2).  The first shelf (110.sub.1) can extend into the posts (105.sub.1 and 105.sub.2) and create the compartments for housing the PSUs (120.sub.1,
120.sub.2).  A second shelf (110.sub.2) is securely coupled to the posts (105.sub.1 and 105.sub.2) and is generally located below the first shelf MOO.  It is to be understood that any number of shelves (110.sub.N) can be coupled to the posts (105.sub.1
and 105.sub.2) and located above or below other shelves (110.sub.1, 110.sub.2, 110.sub.N) in the rack 100.  Furthermore, it is to be understood that any type of secure coupling can be used to attach shelves (110.sub.1, 110.sub.2, 110.sub.N) to posts
(105.sub.1 and 105.sub.2) in a way that fixes their location and provides structural rigidity to the server rack 100.
<br/><br/> Servers (130.sub.1, 130.sub.2, 130.sub.N) are placed on top of the shelves (110.sub.1, 110.sub.2, 110.sub.N) respectively and generally placed at the center of their respective shelves, equidistant from the first and second sides.  Each shelf
(110.sub.1, 110.sub.2 or 110.sub.N) can house one or more servers (e.g. 130.sub.1) of same or different form factors.  The servers (e.g. 130.sub.1, 130.sub.2, 130.sub.N) can be removably coupled to the shelves (110.sub.1, 110.sub.2, 110.sub.N).  In
nonlimiting implementations, a load (e.g. 130.sub.1 can also include any combination of appliances, data center components, server system components, communication components, AC components, DC components and electronic devices.
<br/><br/> The power supply units (or modules) (120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4, 120.sub.M+1) include power converters and backup power sources.  In an implementation, the power distribution units controllers (e.g. 140.sub.1 and 140.sub.2)
provide an AC fuse function or circuit breaker function and are removably coupled to a power control shelf (145) of the server rack 100.  Furthermore, removable coupling allows the PDUs (140.sub.1 and 140.sub.2) to be hot swappable.  In an
implementation, the power control shelf (e.g. 145) is located above the first shelf (110.sub.1).  In an implementation, the PDUs (140.sub.1 and 140.sub.2) provide the initial AC power input connection for the server rack 100.  In an implementation, the
PDUs (140.sub.1 and 140.sub.2) are electrically coupled to the power supply modules (120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4, 120.sub.M+1).  In an implementation, the power supply modules (e.g. 120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4, 120.sub.M+1)
convert AC input to DC output.  In an implementation, power supply modules (e.g. 120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4, 120.sub.M+1) are mounted separate and external to server rack 100.
<br/><br/> In an implementation, power supply modules (e.g. 120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4, 120.sub.M+1) are electronic assemblies of batteries coupled to power converters.  In an implementation, the power supply modules (e.g. 120.sub.1,
120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4, 120.sub.M+1) are removably coupled to the shelves (e.g. 110.sub.1, 110.sub.2, 110.sub.N).  Removable coupling allows the power supply modules (e.g. 120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4, 120.sub.M+1) to be hot
swappable.  Power supply modules (e.g. 120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4, 120.sub.N, 120.sub.M+1) are electrically coupled to loads (e.g. 130.sub.1, 130.sub.2, 130.sub.N).  Power supply modules (e.g. 120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4,
120.sub.M, 120.sub.M+1) invert or transform AC or DC input into AC or DC output for use by the loads (e.g. 130.sub.1, 130.sub.2, 130.sub.N).  The server rack 100 can be placed inside or attached to a system, device or room at various orientations
including vertically, horizontally or at an angle.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates a rear view 200 of the power distribution components in an exemplary server rack.  Viewed from the back side of the server rack 100, an array of electrical distribution busses (including e.g. 250.sub.1, 250.sub.2, 260.sub.1,
260.sub.2, 270.sub.1 and 270.sub.N) is securely coupled to the server rack 100.  The power supply modules (e.g. 120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.M+1) are coupled to horizontal busses (e.g. 260.sub.1, 260.sub.2, 260.sub.3, 260.sub.4, 260.sub.M and
260.sub.M+1) as shown.  Busses (260.sub.1, 260.sub.2, 260.sub.3, 260.sub.4, 260.sub.M and 260.sub.M+1) are securely coupled to vertical bus bars (250.sub.1, 250.sub.2) as shown.  Vertical bus bars (250.sub.1 and 250.sub.2) are also coupled to busses
(270.sub.1, 270.sub.2 and 270.sub.N) and to the servers (130.sub.1, 130.sub.2, 130.sub.N).  In an implementation, power cables are used in place of bus bars (250.sub.1, 250.sub.2).  In this disclosure, bus bars can be replaced with less rigid busses; for
example, busses made of short lengths of cables having lugs and/or locations for forming bolted interconnections.  As shown, power supply modules (e.g. 120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4, 120.sub.M+1) are coupled to distribution busses (e.g.
260.sub.1, 260.sub.2, 260.sub.3, 260.sub.4, 260.sub.M+1).
<br/><br/> The server rack architecture of FIG. 2 provides an uniform distribution of current along the various power distribution busses (including e.g. 250.sub.1, 250.sub.2).  Uniform current distribution results from placing the power supply modules
(120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4, 120.sub.M+1) near the loads (e.g. 130.sub.1, 130.sub.2, 130.sub.N).  Lower current density results from supplying each load (e.g. 130.sub.1) with the current from one or two power supply modules (e.g.
120.sub.1 and 120.sub.2) through their respective busses (e.g. 250.sub.1, 250.sub.2, 260.sub.1, 260.sub.2 and 270.sub.1).  As a result, the busses (including e.g. 250.sub.1, 250.sub.2, 260.sub.1, 260.sub.2 and 270.sub.1) can be a of smaller size to
accommodate this uniform and lower distribution of current density.  Conventional server rack designs have the current concentrated at the top or at the bottom of the server rack.  As such, all of the current used by the loads in the rack flows through a
single point, and is then distributed along the rack.  Conventional architecture requires the bus to be sized for the largest current load.  The subject disclosure allows for smaller bus sizes, which results in reduced material costs.  Another benefit of
using the server rack architecture shown in FIG. 2 is the improved isolation of component failures.  For example, having multiple power supply modules (e.g. 120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4, 120.sub.M, and 120.sub.M+1) and common connecting
busses (e.g. 250.sub.1 and 250.sub.2) provide redundancy that prevents failure of the entire rack 100 upon failure of an individual component.  This reduces the size of the effect of certain catastrophic failures on the rack.  For example, if one power
supply (e.g. 120.sub.1) was to fail, it would not cause the entire server rack to fail because the other power supplies (e.g. 120.sub.3, 120.sub.M) in the rack would remain in operation.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates a rear view 300 of the power distribution components in an exemplary server rack having divided horizontal busses.  As shown, the power supply modules (e.g. 120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4, 120.sub.M+1, 120.sub.M+1)
are coupled to busses (e.g. 360.sub.1, 360.sub.2, 360.sub.3, and 360.sub.4, 360.sub.M, 360.sub.M+1).  Busses are coupled to the vertical bus bars 350.sub.1 and 350.sub.2 respectively.  Vertical bus bar 350.sub.1 is coupled to busses 370.sub.1, 370.sub.3,
370.sub.M Vertical bus bar 350.sub.2 is coupled to busses 370.sub.2, 370.sub.4, 370.sub.M+1.  Busses 370.sub.1, 370.sub.3, 370.sub.M are coupled to servers 330.sub.1, 330.sub.3, 330.sub.N respectively.  Busses 370.sub.2, 370.sub.4, 370.sub.M+1 are
coupled to servers 330.sub.2, 330.sub.4, 330.sub.M+1 respectively.  Two servers (e.g. 330.sub.1 and 330.sub.2) are placed on top of a shelf (e.g. 110.sub.1).  Two servers (e.g. 330.sub.3 and 330.sub.4) are placed on top of another shelf (e.g. 110.sub.2). The servers (e.g. 330.sub.1 and 330.sub.2) are placed generally equidistant from the center of the rack 100 towards the left and right posts (105.sub.1 and 105.sub.2).  Each of the benefits of using the server rack architecture shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2
are common with the server architecture shown in FIG. 3.  Furthermore, dividing the bus bars horizontally (e.g. 370.sub.1, 370.sub.2, 370.sub.3, and 370.sub.4, 370.sub.M, 330.sub.M+1) increases the isolation of failed load components.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates a rear view 400 of the power distribution components in an exemplary server rack having both vertically and horizontally divided busses.  Vertical bus bars (e.g. 450.sub.1 and 450.sub.2) are located above vertical bus bars
(e.g. 450.sub.3 and 450.sub.4) respectively.  Eight (8) power supply modules (120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4 and 420.sub.1, 420.sub.2, 420.sub.3, 420.sub.4) are coupled to eight horizontal busses (360.sub.1, 360.sub.2, 360.sub.3, 360.sub.4
and 460.sub.1, 460.sub.2, 460.sub.3, 460.sub.4) respectively.  As shown, busses 360.sub.1, 360.sub.2, 360.sub.3, and 360.sub.4 are coupled to vertical bus bars 450.sub.1 and 450.sub.2.  Also, as shown, busses 460.sub.1, 460.sub.2, 460.sub.3, 460.sub.4
are coupled to vertical bus bars 450.sub.3 and 450.sub.4.  Vertical bus bars 450.sub.1 and 450.sub.2 are coupled to busses 370.sub.1, 370.sub.2, 370.sub.3, 370.sub.4.  Vertical bus bars 450.sub.3 and 450.sub.4 are coupled to busses 470.sub.1, 470.sub.2,
470.sub.3, 470.sub.4.  Busses 370.sub.1, 370.sub.2, 370.sub.3, 370.sub.4, are coupled to servers 330.sub.1, 330.sub.2, 330.sub.3, 330.sub.4.  Busses 470.sub.1, 470.sub.2, 470.sub.3, 470.sub.4 are coupled to servers 430.sub.1, 430.sub.2, 430.sub.3,
430.sub.4.  Each of the benefits of using the server rack architecture shown in FIG. 3 is common to the server architecture shown in FIG. 4.  Furthermore, dividing the bus bars both horizontally and vertically further increases the isolation of failed
load components.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates a rear view 500 of an exemplary server rack having a central vertical power distribution bus.  An array of electrical distribution busses (e.g. 550.sub.1, 560.sub.1, 560.sub.2, 570.sub.1, 570.sub.2) is securely coupled to the
server rack 100 shown in FIG. 1 and is located at the rear side of the server rack.  Two power supply modules 120.sub.1 and 120.sub.2 are coupled to the buss 560.sub.1.  Two power supply modules 120.sub.3 and 120.sub.4 are coupled to the buss 560.sub.2. 
Busses (e.g. 560.sub.1, 560.sub.2) are coupled to vertical bus bar (e.g. 550.sub.1).  A central vertical distribution bus (e.g. 550.sub.1) is generally located centered between the first and second sides.  Vertical bus bar (e.g. 550.sub.1) is coupled to
horizontal busses (e.g. 570.sub.1 and 570.sub.2).  Bus 570.sub.1 is coupled to server 530.sub.1.  Bus 570.sub.2 is coupled to server 530.sub.2.  The two servers 530.sub.1 and 530.sub.2 are placed on top of the shelves 510.sub.1 and 510.sub.2
respectively.  The servers are placed generally centered, equidistant from the first and second sides.  Each of the benefits of using the server rack architecture shown in FIG. 2 is common with the server architecture shown in FIG. 5.  However, the
architecture shown in FIG. 5 utilizes less bus materials by having the single vertical bus.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 illustrates a rear view 600 of an exemplary server rack demonstrating architecture including multiple, central, vertical distribution busses (e.g. 550.sub.1, 650.sub.2).  Viewed from the back side of the server rack 100, an array of
electrical distribution busses (e.g. 550.sub.1, 650.sub.2, 560.sub.1, 560.sub.2, 570.sub.1, 570.sub.2, 660.sub.1, 660.sub.2, 670.sub.1, 670.sub.2) is securely coupled to the server rack 100 at the rear side of the server rack.  Four (4) power supply
modules 120.sub.1, 120.sub.2, 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4 are coupled to horizontal busses 560.sub.1, 560.sub.2.  Four (4) power supply modules 620.sub.1, 620.sub.2, 620.sub.3, 620.sub.4 are coupled to horizontal busses 660.sub.1, 660.sub.2.  Busses 560.sub.1,
560.sub.2 are coupled to vertical bus bar 550.sub.1.  Busses 660.sub.1, 660.sub.2 are coupled to vertical bus bar 650.sub.1.  Vertical bus bars (550.sub.1, 650.sub.1) are generally located centered between the first and second sides.  The first vertical
bus bar (550.sub.1) is located above second vertical bus bar (e.g. 650.sub.2).  Vertical bus bars 650.sub.1, 650.sub.2 are also coupled to horizontal busses (e.g. 570.sub.1, 570.sub.2, 670.sub.1, 670.sub.2).  Busses 570.sub.1, 570.sub.2, 670.sub.1,
670.sub.2 are coupled to servers (e.g. 130.sub.1, 130.sub.2, 630.sub.1, 630.sub.2).  Four (4) servers (e.g. 130.sub.1, 130.sub.2, 630.sub.1, 630.sub.2) are placed on top of shelves (e.g. 510.sub.1, 510.sub.2, 610.sub.1, 610.sub.2).  The servers are
placed generally centered, equidistant from the first and second sides.  Each of the benefits of using the server rack architecture shown in FIG. 5 is common with the server architecture shown in FIG. 6.  Furthermore, the architecture shown in FIG. 6
provides for additional component isolation by dividing the vertical bus.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary graphical representation 700 of a power supply unit.  In an implementation, each power supply module 710.sub.N includes a battery 725.sub.N (or another type of energy storage device that can be used as a backup
power source) and a power converter with uninterruptable power supply 720.sub.N.  Each battery 725.sub.N is removably coupled to a power converter 720.sub.N.  The battery 725.sub.N is accessible from the front side of the server rack 100 and can be
removed from the front side of the server rack 100.  Removable coupling of the battery 725.sub.N includes mechanical and electrical coupling.
<br/><br/> In an implementation, the power supply module 710.sub.N receives AC input from an AC source 735 through distribution lines 730.sub.N.  The power supply module 710.sub.N provides AC or DC output through distribution lines 740.sub.N.  In another
implementation, the power supply module 710.sub.N receives DC input from a DC source 735 through distribution lines 730.sub.N.  The power supply module 710.sub.N provides AC or DC output through distribution lines 740.sub.N.  Output distribution lines
740.sub.N include busses and bus bars.  Furthermore, each power supply module 710.sub.N sends and receives digital communication through communication lines 750.sub.N from a controller 770.  In various implementations power inputs and outputs are all AC,
or all DC, or a combination thereof.  It is to be understood that any combination of electrical inputs and outputs can be used with the server rack architecture 100 and with the power supply modules outlined herein.  The power lines 730.sub.N and
740.sub.N and the communication lines 750.sub.N can be implemented by using a power strip 780.  The power strip 780 can be vertically secured to the back of the server 100.  The power strip 780 distributes both AC and DC power and also facilitates
communication between the host 770 and the PSUs (e.g. 710.sub.N).
<br/><br/> One of the benefits of the power supply module shown in FIG. 7 is improved serviceability.  By locating the battery 725.sub.N in front of the power converter 720.sub.N, the battery 725.sub.N is made more accessible from the front of the server
rack 100.  By having a removable connector between the battery 725.sub.N and the power converter 720.sub.N, the battery 725.sub.N can be hot swapped.  By having the AC 730.sub.N, DC 740.sub.N and digital communication lines connected to the power supply
module 710.sub.N from the back side of the server 100, the serviceability of the module 710.sub.N is made easier.  Furthermore, having the AC 730.sub.N, DC 740.sub.N and digital communication lines coupled to the power supply module 710.sub.N from the
back side of the rack 100 facilitates the use of the bus components and server rack architecture described herein.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary isometric graphical representation 800 of a PSU tray and a server rack.  In an implementation, the PSU tray 810.sub.N includes four vertically oriented sides and a bottom.  Each of the four vertical sides is
coupled to one another at two edges.  Each of the four vertical sides is coupled to the edges of the bottom.  In nonlimiting implementations, the sides and bottom can be coupled permanently, removably, or hinged as mentioned in this description.  The
walls and bottom can be of rigid or flexible materials.  The walls can be of any shape.  In one implementation, the vertical walls are shaped with cutouts to accommodate manipulation of the power supply module.  In an implementation, the tray 810.sub.N
includes details that allow users to grasp the tray from the front of the server rack 100 and remove the tray and a power supply module (e.g. 120.sub.1).  Nonlimiting examples of these details are handles, knobs or hooks.  The details can be mounted to
the top, front, first side or second side of the trays.  In an implementation, a side is located at the rear of the tray.  This rear side may be of any height.  In an implementation, removable coupling of the batteries includes the use of a tray
810.sub.N having interior dimensions such that a power converter 720 and a battery 725 would fit with minimal clearance and be mechanically retained by any two opposing sides of the tray.  It is to be understood that the battery 725 is only one type of
backup power source that can be used.  Other types of energy storage devices can be used as backup power sources.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 illustrates a flow diagram of an exemplary method for assembling a server rack.  According to the methodology shown in the flow diagram 900, at 910, shelves (such as 110.sub.1, 110.sub.2, and 110.sub.N as shown in FIG. 1) are stacked
vertically to form the rack.  At 920, a first server (such as 130.sub.1 as shown in FIG. 1) is located between the first and second power supply modules (such as 120.sub.1 and 120.sub.2 as shown in FIG. 1) on a first shelf (such as 110.sub.1 as shown in
FIG. 1).  At 930, a second server (such as 130.sub.2 as shown in FIG. 1) is located between the third and fourth power supply modules (such as 120.sub.3, 120.sub.4 as shown in FIG. 1) on a second shelf (such as 110.sub.2 as shown in FIG. 1).
<br/><br/> At 940, a first bus bar (such as vertical bus 250.sub.1 as shown in FIG. 2) is connected to first and third power supply modules (such as 120.sub.1 and 120.sub.3 as shown in FIG. 2).  At 950, a second bus bar (such as vertical bus 250.sub.2 as
shown in FIG. 2) is connected to second and fourth power supply modules (such as 120.sub.2 and 120.sub.4 as shown in FIG. 2).  At 960, the first bus bar (such as vertical bus 250.sub.1 as shown in FIG. 2) is connected to a first server (such as 130.sub.1
as shown in FIG. 2) to supply voltage and current to the first server.  At 970, the second bus (such as vertical bus 250.sub.2) is coupled to a second server (such as 130.sub.2 as shown in FIG. 2) to supply voltage and current to the second server.
<br/><br/> A benefit of using the method of server rack assembly 900 is the resulting more uniform distribution of lower current density along the various power distribution busses (such as 250.sub.1, 260.sub.M and 270.sub.M shown in FIG. 2).  Uniform
current distribution results from placing the power supply modules (such as 120.sub.N shown in FIG. 2) near the loads e.g. 130.sub.N shown in FIG. 1).  Lower current results from supplying each load (such as 130.sub.N shown in FIG. 2) with the current
from one or two power supply modules (such as 120.sub.N shown in FIG. 2) through their respective busses (such as 250.sub.1, 250.sub.2, 260.sub.N+1 and 270.sub.M shown in FIG. 2).  Busses (such as 250.sub.1, 260.sub.M and 270.sub.N shown in FIG. 2) can
be a smaller size and adequately accommodate this uniform distribution of lower current density.  Another benefit of using the method of assembling server rack architecture shown in FIG. 9 is the improved accessibility to the power supply modules (e.g.
120.sub.1 thru M+1 shown in FIG. 2).  Being located to the first and second sides and distributed vertically, the power supply modules (120.sub.1 thru M+1) are accessible from the front side of the server rack 100 shown in FIG. 1.  Another benefit of the
method of assembling a server rack shown in FIG. 9 is that multiple power supply modules (e.g. 120.sub.1,2,3 shown in FIG. 2) are attached to the common bus bars 250.sub.1 and 250.sub.2 and the servers (e.g. 130.sub.N) shown in FIG. 2.  This provides for
a redundancy of power.  It is to be understood that the rack can be placed or positioned inside a computer system, a device or a server room vertically, horizontally or at an angle.  It is to be understood that if the rack is positioned horizontally or
at an angle, the devices on the rack must be secured to the shelves such that they don't slide or fall off the rack because of gravity.  It is also to be understood that the various shelves and busses of the server rack can be positioned at different

<br/><br/> FIG. 10 illustrates an example methodology for hot swapping a server rack component.  According to the construction methodology flow diagram 1000, at 1010, a component requiring service is identified.  Service as used herein can include, for
example, repair, replacement or inspection.  At 1020, the component requiring service is removed from the rack.  To that end, the component requiring service is turned off and no other components in the rack are turned off.  Turning off includes, for
example, pushing buttons or sending control signals that deactivate the operations of the component.  The primary advantage of hot swapping is that a component is removed and replaced from a system of components without affecting the operation of the
other components.  The server rack system 100 as discussed herein facilitates hot swapping PDUs (e.g. 140.sub.1 shown in FIG. 1) power supply modules (e.g. 120.sub.N shown in FIG. 1) and servers (e.g. 130.sub.N shown in FIG. 1).  It is to be understood
that other components can be added to the server rack 100 and can be hot swappable.  The component requiring service is also mechanically disconnected from the rack.  Mechanical disconnection includes the disassembly of any of the mechanical couplings
discussed herein.  Prior to or after mechanically disconnecting the component, the component requiring service is electrically disconnected from the rack.  Electrical disconnection includes disassembly of any of the electrical couplings discussed herein. At 1030, a new, repaired or replacing component is electrically, mechanically and/or programmatically connected to the rack.  Mechanical reconnection includes returning the component to its shelf, tray or otherwise placed into the rack.  At 1040, the
component is turned on and its operation commences.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 illustrates an exemplary graphical representation 1100 of a server rack with removable PSUs racks.  A server component rack 1104 is supported by four corner posts or two sides, vertically oriented to define four sides including a front,
a back and two additional sides.  The server component rack 1104 houses and physically supports load components (e.g. 1130.sub.N, 1133.sub.N and 1136.sub.N).  A PSUs rack 1108 is also shown that houses and physically supports PSUs and related components
(e.g. 1140.sub.N (e.g. a PDU), 1150.sub.N (e.g. a bus) 1120.sub.N, (e.g. a PSU)).  Additionally, the PSUs rack (or power components rack) 1108 has multiple wheels or casters 1180.  The wheels 1180 facilitate the movement of the power component rack 1108
independently of server component rack 1104.
<br/><br/> The PDU 1140.sub.N receives external AC (or DC) voltage and current, and controls the flow of the input current (e.g. by using fuses or circuit breakers).  Power control modules 1140.sub.N are connected to power supply modules 1120.sub.N.  Bus
bars 1160.sub.N are coupled to power supply modules 1120.sub.N and vertical bus bars 1150.sub.N.  Bus bars 1170.sub.N are coupled to vertical bus bar 1150.sub.N and loads (e.g. 1130.sub.N, 1133.sub.N and 1136.sub.N).  In an implementation, bus bars
1170.sub.N are securely coupled to vertical bus bars 1150.sub.N and removably coupled to the loads (e.g. 1130.sub.N, 1133.sub.N and 1136.sub.N) such that bus bars 1170.sub.N generally travel as parts of the power component rack 1108.  In an
implementation, bus bars 1175.sub.N are securely coupled to the loads (e.g. 1130.sub.N, 1133.sub.N and 1136.sub.N) and removably coupled to the vertical bus bars 1150.sub.N such that the bus bars 1175.sub.N generally travel with the loads.
<br/><br/> The advantages of the implementation of the server rack 1104 and separate power rack 1108 assembly 1100 (assembly) are common with those outlined herein for various implementations.  One additional advantage of the assembly 1100 is the mobility
of power component racks 1108.  For example, when loads on a server rack 1104 require low current, only one power component rack 1108 may be necessary.  The additional power component rack 1108 can be disconnected mechanically and electrically from the
server component rack 1104 in a first location, and moved to a second location.  Such mobility can free space in the first location.  Another advantage of such mobility is the opportunity for servicing the battery rack in the second location.
<br/><br/> What has been described above includes examples of the implementations.  It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies for purposes of describing the claimed subject matter, but it is to
be appreciated that many further combinations and permutations of the subject innovation are possible.  Accordingly, the claimed subject matter is intended to embrace all such alterations, modifications, and variations that fall within the spirit and
scope of the appended claims.  Moreover, the above description of illustrated implementations of the subject disclosure, including what is described in the Abstract, is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the disclosed implementations to the
precise forms disclosed.  While specific implementations and examples are described herein for illustrative purposes, various modifications are possible that are considered within the scope of such implementations and examples, as those skilled in the
relevant art can recognize.
