       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> An animation timeline is analyzed to determine one or more discrete
     states. Each discrete state includes one or more animation effects. The
     discrete states represent scenes of a slide in a slide presentation. The
     concepts of scenes allows user to view a timeline of scenes, open a
     scene, and direct manipulate objects in the scene to author animations.
     The animations can include motion path animation effects, which can be
     directly manipulated utilizing a motion path tweening method. To aid in
     direct manipulation of a motion path of an object, a ghost version of the
     object can be shown to communicate to a user the position of the object
     after a motion path animation effect that includes the motion path is
     performed. The ghost version may also be used to show a start position
     when a start point is manipulated.

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Presentation application programs, such as MICROSOFT POWERPOINT, available from Microsoft of Redmond, Wash., allow users to create individual pages or "slides" for presentation in the form of a slide show.  Each slide may contain text, graphics,
sound, videos, and other objects.  Animations may be applied to certain objects in a slide, such as text and graphics, to enhance the slide show.
<br/><br/> Currently, MICROSOFT POWERPOINT's animation user interface ("UI") requires users to select an object, apply an animation primitive, and then adjust settings through a series of drop-down menus, spinners, and dialogs.  Animation triggers include
"On click", in which an animation effect is applied upon the click of the slide; "With previous", in which an animation effect is played at the same time as the previous item in the animation list or on load of the slide if the effect is first in the
animation list; and "After previous", in which an animation effect is played immediately following the previous item in the animation list.  Navigating the current MICROSOFT POWERPOINT user interface may be cumbersome to use for some users, and may
prevent others from taking advantage of the animation features included in the program.
<br/><br/> One particular type of animation effect is a motion path animation effect.  When a user wants to animate an object utilizing a motion path animation effect, the user must provide an initial state for the object, a final state for the object, and
define a type of path along which the object will move when the motion path animation effect is executed.  The type of motion path may be a pre-defined motion path or a custom motion path.  If the motion path is a straight line, the initial state or the
end state can be easily adjusted by simply redrawing the line in between the two states.  If the motion path is curved, however, then additional logic that is needed to properly scale the motion path to maintain the motion path itself.  Moreover, when
manipulating a motion path, it is helpful to know the end state of the motion path animation effect to allow for confident re-positioning of the end state.
<br/><br/> It is with respect to these and other considerations that the disclosure made herein is presented.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Concepts and technologies are described herein for creating and managing animations in a presentation application program.  In accordance with the concepts and technologies disclosed herein, an animation timeline is analyzed to determine one or
more discrete states.  Each discrete state includes one or more animation effects.  The discrete states represent scenes of a slide in a slide presentation.  The concepts of scenes allows user to view a timeline of scenes, open a scene, and direct
manipulate objects in the scene to author animations.  The animations can include motion path animation effects, which can be directly manipulated utilizing a motion path tweening method.  To aid in direct manipulation of a motion path of an object, a
ghost version of the object can be shown to communicate to a user the position of the object after a motion path animation effect that includes the motion path is performed.  The ghost version may also be used to show a start position when a start point
is manipulated.
<br/><br/> According to one aspect disclosed herein, a computer-readable storage medium includes computer-executable instructions that, when executed by a computer, cause the computer to present an animation pane on a display connected to the computer. 
The animation pane includes a scenes view and a list view.  The scenes view of the animation pane includes a transparent scene thumbnail that, upon selection, opens a temporary new scene.  The list view includes an animation timeline.  The instructions
also cause the computer to receive a selection of the transparent scene thumbnail from the scenes view, open the temporary new scene, receive a user input including a new animation effect in the temporary new scene, and create a new discrete state in the
animation timeline.  The new discrete state includes the new animation effect.  The instructions also cause the computer to create a new scene from the temporary new scene.  The new scene includes the new animation effect.  The new scene includes a
visualization for the new discrete state.  The instructions also cause the computer to create a new scene thumbnail, create a new transparent scene thumbnail, and present, on the display, the new scene thumbnail and the new transparent scene thumbnail in
the scenes view of the animation pane.
<br/><br/> According to another aspect disclosed herein, a method for generating discrete states of an animation timeline includes analyzing, by a presentation application program executing on a computer, a plurality of animation effects in an animation
timeline to determine one or more discrete states to be generated for the animation timeline, and generating, by the presentation application program executing on the computer, the one or more of discrete states for the animation timeline, wherein each
of the one or more states includes one or more of the plurality of animation effects.  In some embodiments, the analyzing operation of the method includes analyzing the plurality of animation effects in the animation timeline to determine which of the
plurality of animation effects in the animation timeline are triggered by a user-controlled trigger, such as, but not limited to an on mouse click trigger, or a pre-configured trigger, such as, but not limited to, an after previous trigger.  An animation
effect that is triggered by the after previous trigger or the on mouse click trigger indicates a start of one of the one or more discrete states.
<br/><br/> According to yet another aspect disclosed herein, a computer-implemented method for defining animations includes receiving, via a presentation application program executing on a computer, an input of a motion path animation effect for an object. The motion path animation effect includes a start point for the object, an end point for the object, and a motion path between the start point and the end point.  The method further includes receiving, via the presentation application program executing
on the computer, an input of a new start point and a new end point for the object, and scaling, via the presentation application program executing on the computer, the motion path of the motion path animation effect to fit between the new start point and
the new end point for the object.
<br/><br/> According to yet another aspect disclosed herein, a computer-readable storage medium includes computer-executable instructions that, when executed by a computer, cause the computer to present, on a display that is in communication with the
computer, a canvas and an object on the canvas.  The instructions also cause the computer to receive a motion path animation effect for the object.  The motion path animation effect includes a start point, an end point, and a motion path between the
start point and the end point.  The instructions also cause the computer to generate a ghost version of the object, and present, on the display, the object, the ghost version of the object, the start point, the end point, and the motion path on the
canvas.  The ghost version of the object is presented in proximity to the end point, and the ghost version of the object represents the object after the motion path animation effect has been performed.
<br/><br/> It should be appreciated that the above-described subject matter may be implemented as a computer-controlled apparatus, a computer process, a computing system, or as an article of manufacture such as a computer-readable storage medium.  These
and various other features will be apparent from a reading of the following Detailed Description and a review of the associated drawings.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> The following detailed description is directed to concepts and technologies for creating and managing animations in presentation application programs.  According to the concepts and technologies described herein an animation timeline is analyzed
to determine one or more discrete states.  Each discrete state includes one or more animation effects.  The discrete states represent scenes of a slide in a slide presentation.  The concepts of scenes allows user to view a timeline of scenes, open a
scene, and direct manipulate objects in the scene to author animations.  The animations can include motion path animation effects, which can be directly manipulated utilizing a motion path tweening method.  To aid in direct manipulation of a motion path
of an object, a ghost version of the object can be shown to communicate to a user the position of the object after a motion path animation effect that includes the motion path is performed.  The ghost version may also be used to show a start position
when a start point is manipulated.
<br/><br/> While the subject matter described herein is presented in the general context of program modules that execute in conjunction with the execution of an operating system and application programs on a computer system, those skilled in the art will
recognize that other implementations may be performed in combination with other types of program modules.  Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, and other types of structures that perform particular tasks or
implement particular abstract data types.  Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the subject matter described herein may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems,
microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like.
<br/><br/> In the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments or examples.  Referring now to the drawings, in which like
numerals represent like elements throughout the several figures, aspects of a computing system, computer-readable storage medium, and computer-implemented methodology for creating and managing animations in presentation application programs will be
presented.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a user interface diagram illustrating aspects of an exemplary operating environment for various concepts disclosed herein.  In particular, FIG. 1 shows an illustrative user interface 100 provided by a presentation application program
according to one implementation disclosed herein.  As will be described in greater detail below, the user interface 100 is utilized, in part, to author animations for objects, such as shapes, graphics, pictures, text, audio, video, charts, graphs, and
like objects, to view the animations in one or more scenes of an animation sequence, and to manage the scenes.
<br/><br/> In the illustrated embodiment, the user interface 100 includes a layout area 102, a slide selection pane 104, and an animation pane 106.  The configuration of the layout area 102, the slide selection pane 104, and the animation pane 106 is
illustrative and is not intended to be limiting in any way.  The layout area 102 is utilized to create a layout of one or more objects on a slide canvas 108 and to directly manipulate one or more of the objects to author animations to create scenes for
one or more slides of a slide presentation.
<br/><br/> The slide selection pane 104 is utilized to show slide thumbnails for each slide that has been created in the active slide presentation.  These are generally shown slide thumbnails 110.  In the illustrated embodiment, the slide selection pane
104 includes a first slide thumbnail 112 for a first slide and a second slide thumbnail 114 for a second slide.  The second slide thumbnail has been selected and, as a result, the content of the second slide displayed in the slide area 102 on the slide
canvas 108.  As illustrated, the second slide includes a title object 118 and a picture object 120.
<br/><br/> As new slides are added to the presentation or as existing slides are deleted from the presentation, slide thumbnails 110 are respectively added to or deleted from the slide selection pane 104.  A new slide may be added to the presentation by
selecting a grayed-out slide thumbnail 122 in the slide selection pane 104.  Additionally or alternatively, a new slide may be added through a user interface object, such as a user interface icon or user interface menu that is always visible or that is
made visible as a result of some user input, such as a mouse click, touch input, or voice input.
<br/><br/> Each slide in a presentation may include an animation sequence for animations of the objects within the slide.  The animation sequence is represented in the animation pane 106 in either a scenes view 124 or a list view 126.  The list view 126
includes an animation timeline depicting each animation of the animation sequence for the selected slide.  An illustrative list view is described in greater detail below with reference to FIG. 2.  An illustrative animation timeline is described in
greater detail below with reference to FIG. 3.
<br/><br/> The scenes view 124 includes one or more scenes depicted as scene thumbnails in a timeline of scenes 128.  A scene is a discrete state in an animation timeline.  The scene thumbnails may appear like the slide thumbnails 110, but are
representative of scenes within the selected slide thumbnail.  For example, in the illustrated embodiment, a first scene represented in the time line of scenes 128 as a first scene thumbnail 130 has been selected and, accordingly, the title object 118
and the picture object 120 are displayed in the slide area 102 on the slide canvas 108.  If a second scene thumbnail 132 is selected, the layout included in a second scene of the selected slide is displayed in the slide area 102 on the slide canvas 108
and so on.  The selected scene may then be edited by adding or deleting objects, manipulating objects, adding or deleting animations, manipulating animations, and so on.
<br/><br/> An animation of an object that begins with an "On Mouse Click" triggeror an "After Previous" trigger is identified as the start of a new scene.  The "On Mouse Click" causes an animation to begin on click of a mouse.  Other inputs such as touch
or voice inputs may be used as alternative triggers for such functionality.  The "After Previous" trigger causes an animation to begin immediately after the previous item in the animation timeline if the previous item is finished playing.  That is, no
additional click or other input is needed trigger the next animation to start.  Additionally, the first animation in the animation timeline may be the start of a new scene.
<br/><br/> Although an "On Mouse Click" trigger is described above, other exemplary user-controlled triggers that may be used to denote the start of a new scene are contemplated.  Moreover, although an "After Previous" trigger is described above, other
exemplary pre-configured triggers that may be used to denote the start of a new scene are contemplated.  As such, the uses of an "On Mouse Click" trigger and an "After Previous" trigger herein are intended to be illustrative and should not be interpreted
as being limiting.
<br/><br/> In the illustrated embodiment, the scenes view 124 and the list view 126 are selectable via tabs within the animation pane 106.  It should be understood that other configurations are possible including, but not limited to, dedicated animation
panes for each view.  As such, the illustrated embodiment should not be interpreted as being limiting in any way.
<br/><br/> Each scene thumbnail in the timeline of scenes 128 may be associated with a scene number 134, as in the illustrated embodiment.  Moreover, each scene thumbnail in the timeline of scenes 128 may include an icon or other visual representation of
the type of trigger that causes the scene to be played.  In the illustrated embodiment, a mouse icon 136 is shown adjacent to the second scene thumbnail to indicate that the second scene thumbnail 132 is triggered by an "On Mouse Click" trigger.  As will
be shown in FIG. 3, a clock icon may be used to indicate that a particular scene is triggered by an "After Previous" trigger.  This icon or any other such icon may be relegated to the animation timeline in the list view 126, may be included in the scenes
view 124 and the list view 126, or may not be displayed at all.  These icons are merely illustrative and should not be interpreted as being limiting in any way.
<br/><br/> The illustrated timeline of scenes 128 includes a line 138 to the next scene to represent linearity between the scenes.  The line 138 extends through each scene thumbnail in the timeline of scenes 128 and ends at a transparent scene thumbnail
140.  Selection of the transparent scene thumbnail 140 causes a temporary new scene (not shown) to be shown on the slide canvas 108.  After an animation is received within the temporary new scene, the temporary new scene becomes a new scene.  The new
scene is then added to the animation timeline of the list view 126 as a new discrete state, and a new scene thumbnail (not shown) is added to the scenes view 124.  Another transparent scene thumbnail like the transparent scent thumbnail 140 then may be
added to the timeline of scenes 128.
<br/><br/> Although only a layout area 102, a slide selection pane 104, and an animation pane 106 have been described, one or more additional areas, panes, or other user interface spaces may be provided in the user interface 100 concurrently with the above
or in various different interactive states of the user interface 100.  For instance, additional areas, panes, or other spaces might also be provided for displaying user interface icons or other types of user interface objects for initiating some of the
functionality described herein and other functions including, but not limited to, other functions of presentation application programs such as MICROSOFT POWERPOINT, available from MICROSOFT CORPORATION of Redmond, Wash., and other functions not disclosed
herein.
<br/><br/> In this regard, it should be appreciated that the user interface 100 and the remainder of the user interfaces disclosed herein have been greatly simplified for purposes of discussion.  The user interfaces described herein might include more or
fewer components, might be arranged differently, and might operate in a different fashion while still remaining within the scope of the disclosure provided herein.  It should also be appreciated that while various user input devices will be described
with respect to the various embodiments disclosed herein, other types of user input mechanisms might also be utilized.  For instance, although the various embodiments described herein are disclosed in conjunction with the use of a mouse user input device
controlling a mouse cursor, other types of user input devices and mechanisms such as keyboards, touch screens, proximity sensors, accelerometers, voice input, and others may be utilized.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a user interface diagram of the user interface 100 illustrating additional aspects of an exemplary operating environment for various concepts disclosed herein.  In the illustrated embodiment, the list view 126 has been selected in the
animation pane 106.  The list view 126 includes an animation timeline 200.  The animation timeline 200 includes a list of animations and the objects to which the animations have been applied.  The animation timeline 200 may also include a scene number
202 to indicate the scene to which each animation or group of animations is associated, as in the illustrated embodiment.  As also shown in the illustrated embodiment, each animation in the animation timeline 200 may include an animation icon 204 to
indicate a type of animation effect or a category of animation effects currently associated with the object referenced in an object description 206.
<br/><br/> Illustrative categories of animation effects include, but are not limited to, entrance animation effects, exit animation effects, emphasis animation effects, and motion path animation effects.  Illustrative entrance animation effect include, but
are not limited to, appear effect, fade effect, fly in, float in, split, wipe, shape, wheel, random bars, grow and turn, zoom, swivel, and bounce.  Illustrative exit animation effects include, but are not limited to, disappear, fade, fly out, float out,
split, wipe, shape, wheel, random bars, shrink and turn, zoom, swivel, and bounce.  Illustrative emphasis effects include, but are not limited to, pulse, color pulse, teeter, spin, grow, shrink, desaturate, darken, lighten, transparency, object color,
complementary color, line color, brush color, font color, underline, bold flash, bold reveal, and wave.  Illustrative motion path effects include, but are not limited to, lines, arcs, turns, shapes, loops, and custom paths.
<br/><br/> In the illustrated embodiment, a second scene has been selected and is shown on the slide canvas 108.  The second scene includes the title object 118, the picture object 120, and a text box object 208.  The second scene is shown as being
triggered by an "On Mouse Click" trigger, as indicated by the mouse icon 136.
<br/><br/> The illustrated animation timeline 200 includes an animation effect for the picture object 120 and an animation for the text box 208.  In particular, a motion path animation effect has been applied to the picture object 120, as indicated by an
illustrative motion path icon 210, and an appear entrance effect has been applied to the text box object 208, as indicated by an illustrative appear icon 212.  The motion path animation effect causes the picture object 120 to move from the center of the
slide canvas 108 to the right side of the slide canvas 108.  The motion path along which the picture object 120 moves to reach the end point at the right side of the slide canvas 108 may be directly manipulated to create a custom motion path, as will be
described in greater detail below.  The appear entrance effect causes the text box object 208 to appear on the slide canvas 108.  It should be understood that these particular animation effects are merely illustrative and are not intended to be limiting
in any way.  It also should be understood that additional animations may be applied to each object, such as is the case illustrated for the picture object 120 in the first scene.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating aspects of an animation timeline before and after a scene analysis is performed, according to an illustrative embodiment.  The animation timeline before the scene analysis is performed is illustrated as a before
state 300.  The animation timeline after the scene analysis is performed is illustrated as an after state 302.  It should be understood that the contents of the animation timeline in the before state 300 and the after state 302 are merely illustrative
and are not intended to be limiting in any way.  In some embodiments, only the after state 302 is shown in the list view 126 of the animation pane 106.  As such, the before state 300 is shown to demonstrate how the presentation application program
analyzes a plurality of animation effects in an animation timeline to determine one or more discrete states that are to be generated for the timeline and shown in the scene view 124 of the animation pane 106 as one or more selectable scene thumbnails.
<br/><br/> The illustrated before state 300 of the animation timeline includes a plurality of animation effects, shown generally as animation effects 304.  Each of the animation effects 304 includes an animation icon, shown representatively as an animation
icon 306 for a first animation effect of the animation effects 304.  Each of the animation effects 304 also includes an object description, shown representatively as an object description 308.
<br/><br/> The animation effects 304 are divided into one or more scenes.  As mentioned above, a scene is a discrete state in the animation timeline.  The first animation in any given discrete state is an animation that is triggered by an "On Mouse Click"
trigger or an "After Previous" trigger.  The first animation in the animation timeline also indicates the beginning of a first scene.
<br/><br/> In the illustrated embodiment, the animation effects 304 are divided into six scenes 310A-310F.  The first scene 310A begins with an animation effect that is to be applied to OBJECT 1 and ends with an animation effect that is to be applied to
OBJECT 4.  The first scene 310A is demarcated from the second scene 310B by an animation effect that is to be applied to OBJECT 5 and that is triggered by an "After Previous" trigger, as indicated by an illustrative clock icon 312.  The third scene 310C
is demarcated from the second scene 310B by an animation effect that is to be applied to OBJECT 6 and that is triggered by an "After Previous" trigger, as also indicated by a clock icon 312.  Similarly, the fourth scene 310D is demarcated from the third
scene 310C by an animation effect that is to be applied to OBJECT 7 and that is triggered by an "After Previous" trigger, as also indicated by a clock icon 312.  The fifth scene 310E is demarcated from the fourth scene 310D by an animation effect that is
to be applied to OBJECT 8 and that is triggered by an "On Mouse Click" trigger, as indicated by a mouse icon 314.  Similarly, the sixth scene 310F is demarcated from the fifth scene 310E by an animation effect that is to be applied to OBJECT 5 and that
is triggered by an "On Mouse Click" trigger, as also indicated by a mouse icon 314.
<br/><br/> In the before state 300 of the animation timeline, the first animation and each animation that is associated with either an "After Previous" trigger or an "On Mouse Click" trigger are numbered.  In the after state 302 of the animation timeline,
each of the six scenes 310A-310F is numbered.  In other words, animation numbering in the before state 300 of the animation timeline user input, such as starting a slide in a slide show or an "On Mouse Click" trigger, but animation numbering in the after
state 302 is based upon to which scene each animation belongs.  The after state 302 of the animation timeline is made viewable in the scenes view 126 after the scene analysis.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 4A-4B are user interface diagrams of the animation pane 106 illustrating aspects of a mechanism for adding a new scene to a slide, according to an illustrative embodiment.  FIG. 4A illustrates the animation pane 106 in the scenes view 124
and FIG. 4B illustrates the animation pane 106 in the list view 126.  FIG. 4A will now be described.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4A illustrates a first state 400 of the animation pane 106, a second state 402 of the animation pane 106, and a third state 404 of the animation pane 106.  The first state 400 of the animation pane 106 shows a transparent scene thumbnail
140.  When the transparent scene thumbnail 140 is selected, as shown in the second state 402 of the animation pane 106, a temporary new scene (not shown) is created.  The temporary new scene is displayed on the slide canvas 108.  After an object and/or
animation are added to the temporary new scene, the temporary new scene becomes a new scene, which is represented in the third state 404 of the animation pane 106 as a new scene thumbnail 406.  A new transparent scene thumbnail 408 may be created and
positioned after the new scene thumbnail 406, as in the illustrated embodiment.  The new transparent scene thumbnail 408 functions like the transparent scene thumbnail 140.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4B illustrates the first state 400 of the animation pane 106 and the third state 406 of the animation pane 106 when the animation pane 106 is in the list view 126.  The first state 400 of the animation pane 106 in the list view 126 is empty
to reflect that no scenes exist.  It is contemplated, however, that a user interface object (not shown) may be made available to facilitate creation of a new scene within the list view 126.  The third state 406 of the animation pane 106 in the list view
126 shows a new scene animation list 410 including the animation effects applied during the new scene represented as the new scene thumbnail 406 in the scenes view 124 of FIG. 4A.  The second state 404 is not illustrated in FIG. 4B since the new scene
animation list 410 does not exist until a new scene is created after an object and/or animation are added to the temporary new scene.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 5A-5B are user interface diagrams of the animation pane 106 illustrating aspects of a mechanism for deleting a scene from a slide, according to an illustrative embodiment.  FIG. 5A illustrates the animation pane 106 in the scenes view 124
and FIG. 5B illustrates the animation pane 106 in the list view 126.  FIG. 5A will now be described.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5A illustrates a first state 500 of the animation pane 106, a second state 502 of the animation pane 106, and a third state 504 of the animation pane 106.  The first state 500 of the animation pane 106 shows a first scene thumbnail 506, a
second scene thumbnail 508, and a transparent scene thumbnail 140.  In the illustrated first state 500, the second scene thumbnail 508 has been selected for deletion.  The second scene thumbnail 508 is then deleted from the scenes view 124 of the
animation pane 106 in response a delete input received via a delete key of a keyboard, a delete software button (not shown) available within the animation pane 106 or elsewhere within the user interface 100, or in response to some other input such as a
touch gesture or voice input.  After the second scene thumbnail 508 has been deleted, the animation pane 106 is in the second state 502.
<br/><br/> The second state 502 of the animation pane 106 shows the first scene thumbnail 506 and the transparent scene thumbnail 140.  In the illustrated second state 502, the first scene thumbnail 506 has been selected for deletion.  The first scene
thumbnail 506 is then deleted from the scenes view 124 of the animation pane 106 in response a delete input received in a manner such as described above.  After the first scene thumbnail 506 has been deleted, the animation pane 106 is in the third state
504.  The third state 506 of the animation pane 106 shows the transparent scene thumbnail 140.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5B illustrates the first state 500 of the animation pane 106, the second state 502 of the animation pane 106, and the third state 504 of the animation pane 106 when the animation pane 106 is in the list view 126.  The first state 500 of the
animation pane 106 in the list view 126 shows a first scene animation list 510 and a second scene animation list 512.  The first scene animation list 510 includes the animation effects applied during a first scene of a slide.  The second scene animation
list 512 includes the animation effect applied during a second scene of the slide.
<br/><br/> In the illustrated first state 500, the second scene animation list 512 has been selected for deletion.  The second scene animation list 512 is then deleted from the list view 126 of the animation pane 106 in response a delete input received in
a manner such as described above.  After the second scene animation list 512 has been deleted, the animation pane 106 is in the second state 502.
<br/><br/> The second state 502 of the animation pane in the list view 126 shows the first scene animation list 510.  The first scene animation list 510 has been selected for deletion.  After the first scene animation list 510 has been deleted, the
animation pane 106 is in the third state 502.  The third state 504 of the animation pane 106 in the list view 126 is empty to reflect that no scenes exist.
<br/><br/> In some cases, it may be desirable to delete a scene that is positioned between two scenes.  In these cases, after a scene that is positioned between two scenes is deleted, the initial state of all objects within the next scene after the deleted
scene are applied to the final state of all objects within the scene positioned before the deleted scene to maintain continuity between the scene positioned before the deleted scene and the scene positioned after the deleted scene.
<br/><br/> Scenes may be reordered in the scenes view 124 or the list view 126 in the animation pane.  To reorder a scene, a scene thumbnail or a scene animation list is selected and moved to a new location within the animation pane 106.  The presentation
application program is configured to update all scenes from the start range to the end range of the position change.
<br/><br/> After a scene is opened, objects on the slide canvas 108 that are associated with that scene can be directly manipulated.  In some embodiments, any changes that are made to the objects are encoded as animations in that scene.  Alternatively or
additionally, animations may be inserted.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating aspects of a method 600 for applying changes to a scene, according to an illustrative embodiment.  It should be understood that the operations of the methods disclosed herein are not necessarily presented in
any particular order and that performance of some or all of the operations in an alternative order(s) is possible and is contemplated.  The operations have been presented in the demonstrated order for ease of description and illustration.  Operations may
be added, omitted, and/or performed simultaneously, without departing from the scope of the appended claims.
<br/><br/> It also should be understood that the illustrated methods can be ended at any time and need not be performed in its entirety.  Some or all operations of the methods, and/or substantially equivalent operations, can be performed by execution of
computer-readable instructions included on a computer-storage media, as defined below.  The term "computer-readable instructions," and variants thereof, as used in the description and claims, is used expansively herein to include routines, applications,
application modules, program modules, programs, components, data structures, algorithms, and the like.  Computer-readable instructions can be implemented on various system configurations, including single-processor or multiprocessor systems,
minicomputers, mainframe computers, personal computers, hand-held computing devices, microprocessor-based, programmable consumer electronics, combinations thereof, and the like.
<br/><br/> Thus, it should be appreciated that the logical operations described herein are implemented (1) as a sequence of computer implemented acts or program modules running on a computing system and/or (2) as interconnected machine logic circuits or
circuit modules within the computing system.  The implementation is a matter of choice dependent on the performance and other requirements of the computing system.  Accordingly, the logical operations described herein are referred to variously as states,
operations, structural devices, acts, or modules.  These operations, structural devices, acts, and modules may be implemented in software, in firmware, in special purpose digital logic, and any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, animating a property in a scene propagates the change to the scenes positioned after that scene.  In these embodiments, however, any property in a scene that has been edited may be absolute, meaning changes to the previous
scenes do not affect that scene.  For example, changing the size of an object in a second scene does not affect the same object in the third scene if that same object has had the size property changed in the third scene.  However, if the third scene does
not have an animation for position, changing the position of the object in the second scene does affect the third scene.
<br/><br/> When a property is manipulated in a scene, the presentation application program either adds or modifies an animation to apply the animation effect associated with that animation.  The method 600 provides an illustrative example of this logic.
<br/><br/> The method 600 begins and proceeds to operation 602, wherein it is determined if a property has changed in a current scene or if a property has changed in a previous scene.  If it is determined, at operation 602, that a property has changed in
the current scene or a property has changed in the previous scene, the method 600 proceeds to operation 604.  At operation 604, it is then determined if the property animation primitive exists in the current scene.  If it is determined, at operation 604,
that the property animation primitive exists in the current scene, the method 600 proceeds to operation 606.  At operation 606, the first and last such animation primitive is selected and modified according to the change that was determined to have
occurred in operation 602.  The method 600 then proceeds to operation 608, wherein the method 600 ends.
<br/><br/> If it is determined, at operation 604, that the property animation primitive does not exist in the current scene, the method 600 proceeds to operation 610.  At operation 610, the appropriate animation primitive is added to the end of the current
scene.  The method 600 then proceeds to operation 606.  At operation 606, the first and last such animation primitive is selected and modified according to the change that was determined to have occurred in operation 602.  The method 600 then proceeds to
operation 608, wherein the method 600 ends.
<br/><br/> If it is determined, at operation 602, that a property has not changed in the current scene and a property has not changed in the previous scene, the method 600 proceeds to operation 608.  The method 600 ends at operation 608.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating a visualization 700 of a motion path tweening method, according to an illustrative embodiment.  An illustrative method for motion path tweening is described below with reference to FIGS. 8 and 9.  The
visualization 700 includes the motion path 702, a bounding box 704 encompassing the motion path 702, a start point 706 of the motion path 702, an end point 708 of the motion path 702, a point (Cx, Cy) 710, a direction arrow 712, a vertical reference 714,
an intermediate end point 716 of the motion path 702, and a final end point 718 of the motion path 702.  The motion path 702 may be a non-linear motion path selected from a set of pre-defined motion paths for a motion path animation effect or a custom
motion path created by a user.
<br/><br/> The bounding box 704 includes a SetBoundRotate(angle) property defining an angle of rotation around the point (Cx, Cy) 710, a SetBoundPosition(x, y) defining x and y coordinates of the point (Cx, Cy) 710 on the slide canvas 108, and a
SetBoundSize(width, height) defining a width and height of the bounding box 704.  More generally, the bounding box 704 includes a bound rotation property defining an angle of rotation around a point along the edge of the bounding box 704, a bound
position property defining an x coordinate and a y coordinate of the point, and a bound size property defining the size of the bounding box in width and height components.
<br/><br/> The start point 706 is the starting position of an object to which a motion path animation effect including the motion path 702 has been applied.  The start point 706 may be manipulated by a user, but in the illustrated embodiment remains in
line with the vertical reference 714.  The end point 708 is the ending position of the object.  The point (Cx, Cy) 710 is a point of reference for various operations performed by the motion path tweening method described below.  The direction arrow 712
indicates the direction towards the final end point 718 of the motion path 702.  In the illustrated embodiment, the final end point 718 has been selected by a user and the motion path 702 is to be scaled to accommodate the final end point 718 while
maintaining the shape of the motion path 702.  A method 800 for motion path tweening to accomplish the above will now be described with reference to FIG. 8 and additional reference to FIG. 7.
<br/><br/> The method 800 begins and proceeds to operation 802, wherein the slide canvas 108 is presented in the user interface 100 of the presentation application program.  From operation 802, the method 800 proceeds to operation 804, wherein an input of
an object is received on the slide canvas 108.  From operation 804, the method 800 proceeds to operation 806, wherein an input of a motion path animation effect is received for the object.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a visual representation of the motion path animation effect is shown on the slide canvas 108.  The visual representation of the motion path animation effect includes a start point, a motion path, and an end point.  For
purposes of description, the motion path received in operation 806 will be described as the motion path 702 of FIG. 7.  Accordingly, the start point and the end point of the motion path will be referred to as the start point 706 and the end point 708,
respectively, of the motion path 702.
<br/><br/> From operation 806, the method proceeds to operation 808, wherein a new end point is received for the object.  The new end point may be received through a direct manipulation of the motion path 702 such that the end point 708 of the motion path
702 is moved to the final end point 718.  In some embodiments, a new start point is additionally or alternatively received for the object.  From operation 808, the method 800 proceeds to operation 810, wherein the motion path 702 is scaled to fit between
the start point 706 and the final end point 718.  The operation 810 is further described below with reference to a scaling subprocess 900 of FIG. 9.  From operation 810, the method 800 proceeds to operation 812, wherein the method 800 ends.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a flow diagram illustrating the scaling subprocess 900 performed during operation 810 of the method 800 described above with reference to FIG. 8.  The subprocess 900 utilizes the following utility methods for various calculations.  A
RotateBounds(angle, point) method is used to rotates the bounding box 704 around the point.  A ScaleBounds(factorX, factorY, point) method is used to scale the bounding box 704 relative to the point.  A GetStart method is used to return the start point
of the motion path 704 relative to the point (Cx, Cy) 710.  A GetEnd method is used to return the end point of the motion path 704 relative to the point (Cx, Cy) 712.  The subprocess 900 will now be described with additional reference to FIG. 7 and to
these utility methods to fit the motion path 702 from the start point 706 to the final end point 718.
<br/><br/> The subprocess 900 begins and proceeds to operation 902, wherein the bounding box 704 is associated with the motion path 702.  From operation 902, the subprocess proceeds to operation 904, the SetBoundPosition property is set.  The
SetBoundPosition property, as described above, includes x and y coordinates.  At operation 904, the SetBoundPosition property is provided as SetBoundPosition(newStart.x-GetStart.x, newStart.y-GetStart.y), wherein newStart.x is a x coordinate value of a
start point set for the motion path 702 after a manipulation, GetStart.x is a x coordinate value of the start point 706 for the motion path 702 before the manipulation, newStart.y is a y coordinate value of a start point set for the motion path 702 after
the manipulation, and GetStart.y is a y coordinate value of the start point 706 after the manipulation.  In FIG. 7, the start point 706 remains unchanged after a manipulation of the end point 708.  Accordingly, in the illustrated embodiment, the GetStart
x and y coordinate value are the same as the newStart x and y coordinate values.  In some embodiments, however, the newStart x and/or y coordinate values are changed after the manipulation, in which case the appropriate values would be populated for the
newStart method.  As noted above, the coordinate values for the GetStart and GetEnd methods are calculated relative to the point (Cx, Cy) 710.
<br/><br/> From operation 904, the subprocess 900 proceeds to operation 906, wherein a distance between the start point 706 and the end point 708 is calculated.  This distance is referred to as the old distance, or oldDistance, which is defined as being
equal to the distance between the value returned by the GetStart method and the GetEnd method.  From operation 906, the subprocess 900 proceeds to operation 908, wherein a distance between the start point 706 and the final end point 718 is calculated. 
This distance is referred to as the new distance, or newDistance, which is defined as being equal to the distance between the value returned by the NewStart method and the NewEnd method.
<br/><br/> From operation 908, the subprocess 900 proceeds to operation 910, wherein a distance quotient is calculated.  The distance quotient is calculated as the newDistance divided by the oldDistance calculated, respectively, in operations 906 and 908. 
From operation 910, the method proceeds to operation 912, wherein the width of the bounding box 704 is scaled relative to the value returned by the GetStart method, or, in other words, the start point 706 relative to the point (Cx, Cy) 710.  The width of
the bounding box 704 is calculated utilizing the ScaleBounds method, wherein factorX is set to the distance quotient, factorY is set to 1.0, and the point is set to the value returned by the GetStart method.
<br/><br/> From operation 912, the subprocess 900 proceeds to operation 914, wherein an angle between the start point 706 and the end point 708 is calculated.  This angle is referred to as the old angle, or oldAngle, which is defined as being equal to the
angle between the value returned by the GetStart method and the value returned by the GetEnd method.  From operation 912, the subprocess 900 proceeds to operation 916, wherein an angle between the start point 706 and the final end point 718 is
calculated.  This angled is referred to as the new angle, or newAngle, which is defined as being equal to the angle between the value returned by the NewStart method and the value returned by the NewEnd method.  From operation 916, the subprocess 900
proceeds to operation 918, wherein an angle quotient is calculated.  The angle quotient is equal to the newAngle divided by the oldAngle.
<br/><br/> From operation 916, the subprocess 900 proceeds to operation 920, wherein the RotateBounds method is utilized to rotate the bounding box 704 around the value returned by the GetStart method.  The angle of rotation is calculated is set as the
value returned in operation 918 for the angle quotient.  From operation 920, the subprocess 900 proceeds to operation 922.  The subprocess 900 ends at operation 922.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating the motion path 702 of FIG. 7 after the method 800 and the subprocess 900 of the method 900 have been performed.  Upon selection of the motion path 702, a height adjustment box 1000 is displayed.  The height
adjustment box 1000 facilitates manipulation of the height of the motion path 702 by height adjustment handles 1002.  Scaling the height of the motion path 702 causes an equally proportionate change of the top and bottom portions of the motion path 702
with respect to a line 1004 intersecting the start point 706 and the final end point 718.  This ensures the start point 706 and the final end point 718 of the motion path remain the same.  FIG. 10 illustrates the height of the motion path 702 before
adjustment, after the height of the motion path 702 is decreased, and after the height of the motion path 702 is increased.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 is a diagram illustrating a mechanism for motion path visibility when directly manipulating objects on a slide canvas, according to an illustrative embodiment.  In the illustrated embodiment, an object 1100 is displayed on a slide
canvas, such as the slide canvas 108 described above with reference to FIG. 1.  The object 1100 is associated with a motion path animation effect.  The motion path animation effect includes a start point 1102, an end point 1104, and a motion path 1106. 
The motion path 1106 is illustrated as being linear, but other motion path shapes are contemplated.
<br/><br/> If the motion path animation effect is selected, for example, with a cursor 1108, a ghost version 1110 of the object 1100 is generated and is shown on the slide canvas 108.  The ghost version 1110 represents where on the slide canvas 108 the
object 1100 will appear when the motion path animation effect is performed.  The end point 1104 may be dragged to a new position on the slide canvas 108.  The ghost version 1110 of the object 1100 is shown over the new position.  If the new position is
confirmed, for example, by releasing a mouse button or removing a finger from a touchscreen to end a drag gesture, the end point 1104 is repositioned at the new position and the ghost version 1110 is shown in the new position.  The ghost version may also
be used to show a start position when a start point is manipulated.
<br/><br/> It should be understood that the ghost version 1110 of the object may be transparent, semi-transparent, colored, emphasized, deemphasized, or in some other way visually differentiated from the object 1100.  As such, the illustrated embodiment of
a semi-transparent ghost version is not intended to be limiting in any way.  It should also be understood that the ghost version 1110 need not be positioned such that the end point 1104 is in the center of the ghost version 1110 as in the illustrated
embodiment.  Instead, the ghost version 1110 may be in proximity to the end point 1104.  The ghost version 1110 being in proximity to the end point 1104 includes the ghost version 1110 at least partially intersecting the end point 1104 or being within a
pre-defined distance from the end point 1104 such that it would be apparent to a user where the end position of the object 1100 would be after the motion path animation effect is performed.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 illustrates an illustrative computer architecture 1200 for a device capable of executing the software components described herein for creating and managing animations.  Thus, the computer architecture 1200 illustrated in FIG. 12
illustrates an architecture for a server computer, mobile phone, a PDA, a smart phone, a desktop computer, a netbook computer, a tablet computer, and/or a laptop computer.  The computer architecture 1200 may be utilized to execute any aspects of the
software components presented herein.
