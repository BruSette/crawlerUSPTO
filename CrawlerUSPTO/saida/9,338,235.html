arranged in an M.times.N matrix and the pixel units include a photodiode and a plurality of transistors.  The pixel units accumulate potential generated by the incident light and the voltage of the accumulated potential represents the luminance of the
incident light.  In processing a still image or an image of a video, an image signal output from the image sensor is a set of voltages (i.e. pixel values) output from the pixel units.  An image signal is from one frame (i.e. a still image).  A frame
includes M.times.N pixels.  The image sensor is a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) or Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor.
<br/><br/> A driver drives the image sensor under the control of the controller 160 or 260.  The driver exposes all of the pixels of the image sensor or only the pixels of an intended area among the whole pixels and outputs image data received from the
pixels to the controller 160 or 260.
<br/><br/> The controller 160 or 260 processes an image received from the camera 150 or 250 or an image stored in the memory 130 or 230 on a frame basis and outputs an image frame matching to the display characteristics of the display 116 or 216 (e.g.

the processor.  The device 100 or 200 further includes a ROM connected to a bus, to store static information requested by the processor.  The controller 160 or 260 is a Central Processing Unit (CPU) that provides overall control to the device 100 or 200
and performs the in-vehicle notification service method of the present invention.
<br/><br/> A description will now be given of the interaction between the mobile device 200 and the head unit device 100.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 and the mobile device 200 communicate with one another or are connected to each other through the first and second communication modules 140 and 240 by TCP/IP.  The head unit device 100 and the mobile device 200 use a
service protocol such as UPnP in order to provide the in-vehicle notification service.
<br/><br/> The second controller 260 of the mobile device 200 includes a terminal mode server device module 270 for UPnP communication.  The terminal mode server device module 270 includes an ML notification service module 272 and a Terminal Mode (TM)
application server service module 274.
<br/><br/> The ML notification service module 272 is responsible for a notification service between the head unit device 100 and the mobile device 200.  The notification service has a service type such as urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:MLNotification:1.  The
ML notification service module 272 are also called a TM notification service module.  In this case, the service type is urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:TmNotificationServer:1.
<br/><br/> The TM application server service module 274 executes or terminates applications in the mobile device 200 or manages applications, for example, retrieves an application list.
<br/><br/> The second controller 260 further includes a second Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) server/client module 280 for RTP-based media session connection and a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) server module 290 for VNC-based media session
connection.  VNC is used to display the same screen as displayed on the display 216 of the mobile device 200 on the display 116 of the head unit device 100.
<br/><br/> The first controller 160 of the head unit device 100 includes a terminal mode control point 170 for UPnP communication.  The terminal mode control point 170 manages media session connectivity and VNC connectivity.  The controller 160 further
includes a first RTP server/client module 180 for RTP-based media session connection and a VNC client module 190 for VNC-based media session connection.
<br/><br/> The terminal mode control point 170 operates the second RTP server/client module 280 of the mobile device 200 and the first RTP server/client module 180 of the head unit device 100, for media streaming connection, that is, RTP connection to
conduct a call between the mobile device 200 and the head unit device 100 by transmitting an action request message (or an action invocation message) including a command to the TM application server service module 274.  Moreover, the terminal mode
control point 170 operates the VNC server module 290 of the mobile device 200 by transmitting a LaunchApplication action request message including a LaunchApplication action command to the TM application server service module 274.  The mobile device 200
transmits, to the head unit device 100, a response message including a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) where the VNC client module 190 can access the VNC server module 290 as a return value of the LaunchApplication action command.
<br/><br/> For a VNC connection, the VNC server module 290 of the mobile device 200 and the VNC client module 190 of the head unit device 100 are operated.
<br/><br/> The terminal mode control point 170 uses the following UPnP action commands as listed in Table 1 below between the terminal mode control point 170 and the ML notification service module 272.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 Device Control Name R/O Point R/O GetSupportedNotiTypes( ) R R SetNotiConfiguration( ) R R InvokeNotiAction( ) R R
<br/><br/> In Table 1, R is stands for REQUIRED and O stands for OPTIONAL.  Device R/O indicates whether the ML notification service module 272 (or the mobile device 200) is required and Control Point R/O indicates whether the terminal mode control point
170 is required.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow for describing an action request and a response to the action request.
<br/><br/> To request a list of notification types supported by the mobile device 200, the head unit device 100 transmits a GetSupportedNotiTypes action command to the mobile device 200.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 2, step S210 is an action request step.  Specifically, the terminal mode control point 170 of the head unit device 100 transmits a GetSupportedNotiTypes action request message including a GetSupportedNotiTypes action command
requesting a list of notification types supported by the mobile device 200 to the ML notification service module 272 of the mobile device 200 in step S210.
<br/><br/> In step S220, the ML notification service module 272 transmits a response message including notification types to the terminal mode control point 170 in response to the action request message.
<br/><br/> The response to the GetSupportedNotificationTypes action command includes notification types in the form of A_ARG_TYPE_String separated by commas (,) as illustrated in Table 2.  A_ARG_TYPE_is a temporary value.
<br/><br/> Each action command has a name and at least one factor or argument.  The argument has a Direction and RelatedStateVariable.  Direction indicates whether the argument is set as an argument of the action command or output as the result of the
action command.  RelatedStateVariable is used to determine an argument type.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 Argument Direction RelatedStateVariable NotiTypes OUT A_ARG_TYPE_String
<br/><br/> Preferably, NotiTypes is configured into a form identifiable to a user.  For instance, NotiTypes indicates a call, message, alarm, calendar, etc. Upon receipt of notification types, the terminal mode control point 170 separates commas from the
notification types and configures and displays a screen, that is, a notification GUI (or UI) so that the user selects notification types to receive from the mobile device 200 through the head unit device 100.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow of an operation for registering notification types at the mobile device.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 3, the mobile device 200 includes a notification type manager 320 for managing a notification type and a plurality of applications 310 and 311 for providing a notification service.  Each application that provides a notification
service inside the mobile device 200 registers information about the type of a notification that the application provides to the notification type manager 320.  Each of the applications 310 and 311 registers its application ID, AppID (or
A_ARG_TYPE_AppID) and its notification type to the notification type manager 320.  One application supports a plurality of notification services and one notification type is supported by a plurality of applications.
<br/><br/> The first application 310 (App1) generates a first register message (or a subscribe message requesting subscription) including its application ID, AppID#1 and a notification type, Call and transmits the first register message to the notification
type manager 320 in step S310.
<br/><br/> In step S320, App1 generates a second register message including AppID#1 and a notification type, Message and transmits the second register message to the notification type manager 320.
<br/><br/> The second application 311 (App2) generates a third register message including its application ID, AppID#2 and a notification type, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> and transmits the third register message to the notification type manager 320 in step S330.
<br/><br/> A mobile device platform or the notification type manager 320 preserves a basic notification type list and an application uses one of the notification types listed in the notification type list set by the mobile device platform or the
notification type manager 320.  If the application needs a notification type that is not listed in the notification type list, the application includes the new notification type in a register message.  Preferably, the new notification type is readily
identifiable to a user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow of an operation for registering user-intended notification messages to the mobile device.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 4, the head unit device 100 transmits, to the mobile device 200, a SetNotiConfiguration action request message including user-intended notification service types and a SetNotiConfiguration action command requesting registration
of the user-intended notification service type in step S410.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 sets the user-intended notification types, SelectedNotiTypes as the argument of the SetNotiConfiguration action command, as illustrated in Table 3 below.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00003 TABLE 3 Argument Direction RelatedStateVariable SelectedNotiTypes IN A_ARG_TYPE_String
<br/><br/> The user-selected notification types are separated by commas (,).  If the user wants to receive notification services for all notification types, a "*" value is used.  This kind of notification type selection is made according to preset
information, that is, default selection information.
<br/><br/> Table 4 illustrates the structure of notification event information (or event information), Notification State Variable included in a notification event message (an event notification message or a notification message) that the mobile device 200
transmits to the head unit device 100.

When a user selects an action for a notification through a notification UI, the actionID element must be transmitted to the mobile device 200.  The actionName element indicates an action name. The action name will be shown as a button on a native notification UI.  The appIDs element provides a comma-separated list of application IDs.  Each application ID in the appleIDs element is a unique ID and is identical to one on A_ARG_TYPE_AppList,
expressed as A_ARG_TYPE_String.
<br/><br/> Each of the appIDs element including the notification element as its parent and the appIDs element including the action element as its parent takes the form of a comma-separated list of application IDs (i.e. appIDs) expressed as
A_ARG_TYPE_AppID.  Unless the head unit device 100 provides a native notification GUI, appIDs set in the appIDs element including the notification element as its parent are set as arguments of LaunchApplication action commands or TerminateApplication
action commands.  The mobile device 200 then invokes the LaunchApplication actions sequentially.  One of the LaunchApplication action and the TerminateApplication action is selected based on the truth value of the launchApp element.  If the launchApp
element is set to true, the mobile device 200 invokes the LaunchApplication action.  If the launchApp element is set to false, the mobile device 200 invokes the TerminateApplication action.
<br/><br/> However, if the head unit device 100 provides the native notification GUI, the appIDs element having the notification element as its parent is ignored.  The appIDs element being a child element of an action element corresponding to a button
selected by the user, a button automatically selected by the head unit device 100, or a button selected by the head unit device 100 according to a predetermined rule from among actions represented as buttons of the native notification GUI is executed in
the same manner as the appIDs element including the notification element as its parent.
<br/><br/> If the head unit device 100 supports the native notification GUI, the actions described in Table 4 are represented as buttons in the native notification GUI.  Upon the user selection of one of the buttons, the head unit device 100 transmits to
the mobile device 200 an InvokeNotiAction action request message including an InvokeNotiAction action command.  The InvokeNotiAction command includes an action ID corresponding to the selected button and the ID of the notification message, ActionID and
NotiID.  Table 5 below lists arguments of the InvokeNotiAction action.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00005 TABLE 5 Argument Direction RelatedStateVariable NotiID IN A_ARG_TYPE_NotiID ActionID IN A_ARG_TYPE_ActionID
<br/><br/> Table 6 below lists arguments of another InvokeNotiAction action configured to reduce one LaunchApplication action invocation.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00006 TABLE 6 Argument Direction RelatedStateVariable NotiID IN A_ARG_TYPE_NotiID ActionID IN A_ARG_TYPE_ActionID AppID IN A_ARG_TYPE_AppID ProfileID IN A_ARG_TYPE_ProfileID AppURI OUT A_ARG_TYPE_URI
<br/><br/> The AppID argument includes the first application ID, AppID of the appIDs element having the action element as its parent.  The mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 100 a response message including a Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) with which to access an application having AppID in response to the action request message.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow of an initialization operation for receiving a notification message from the mobile device at the head unit device.
<br/><br/> Step S510 is a device/service discovery &amp; description step in which each of the mobile device 200 and the head unit device 100 discovers the other party by UPnP.
<br/><br/> In step S520, when a user wants to receive only intended notification types from the mobile device 200 through the head unit device 100, the head unit device 100 transmits a GetSupportedNotiTypes action request message including a
GetSupportedNotiTypes action command to the mobile device 200.
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 transmits a response message including its supported notification types to the head unit device 100 in response to the action request message in step S530.  The notification types are expressed in the form of
A_ARG_TYPE_String, that is, strings.  The response message includes a list of supported notification types.
<br/><br/> In step S540, the head unit device 100 displays the received notification types on the first display 116.
<br/><br/> The user selects intended notification types from among the displayed notification types in step S545.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 transmits to the mobile device 200 a SetNotiConfiguration action request message that includes the user-selected notification service types and a SetNotiConfiguration action request requesting registration of these
notification types in step S550.
<br/><br/> In step S560, the head unit device 100 transmits a subscribe message requesting subscription to an ML notification service to the mobile device 200.
<br/><br/> Only when an event to be notified regarding the user-selected notification types has occurred, the mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 100 a notification event message including notification event information in step S570.
<br/><br/> In step S575, upon the receipt of the notification event message, the head unit device 100 displays the notification event information on the first display 116, that is, on a GUI, or receives a screen, that is, a GUI displayed on the second
display of the mobile device 200 by the VNC and displays the received screen to the user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow for displaying notification event information by the VNC at the head unit device, after the head unit device receives a notification event message from the mobile device according to an embodiment
of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 6, upon the occurrence of an event corresponding to any of user-selected notification types, the mobile device 200 transmits a notification event message including notification event information such as an appIDs element to the
head unit device 100 in step S610.
<br/><br/> In step S615, the head unit device 100 extracts an appIDs element including a notification element included in the notification event message as a parent, extracts appIDs based on commas from the appIDs element, and transmits a LaunchApplication
action request message including a LaunchApplication command having the first (e.g., AppID#1) of the appIDs as an argument to the mobile device 200.
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 200 a response message including a URL as a return value of the LaunchApplication command, at which the VNC client module 190 can access the VNC server module 290 in step S620.  The VNC URL
takes the form of "VNC:// .  . . . "
<br/><br/> In step S625, if the VNC server module 290 is accessible using the VNC URL, the head unit device 100 activates the VNC client module 190 and transmits the VNC URL to the VNC client module 190.  The VNC client module 190 can access the VNC server
module 290 through the VNC URL.  The head unit device 100 then receives a screen, i.e. a GUI displayed on the display 216 of the mobile device 200 by a VNC connection or VNC streaming.
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 then sequentially receives LaunchApplication action commands with other appIDs following the first appID and executes applications mapped to the appIDs.  If the applications have already been executed, the applications are
notified at the top of the screen.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 transmits to the mobile device 200 a LaunchApplication action request message including an LaunchApplication action command that has the second (e.g. AppID#2) of the appIDs included in the notification event message as
an argument in step S630.
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 200 a response message including an RTP URL as a return value of the LaunchApplication action command, at which the first RTP server/client module 180 of the head unit device 100 can access
the second RTP server/client module 280 of the mobile device 200 in step S635.  The RTP URL takes the form of "RTP:// .  . . . "
<br/><br/> In step S640, if the second RTP server/client module 280 is accessible using the RTP URL, the head unit device 100 activates the first RTP server/client module 180 and transmits the RTP URL to the first RTP server/client module 180.  The first
RTP server/client module 180 accesses the second RTP server/client module 280 through the RTP URL.  The head unit device 100 then receives voice data of an incoming call at the mobile device 200 or transmit the user's voice data of the call to the mobile
device 200, by an RTP connection or streaming.
<br/><br/> Once a VNC connection is established in the above manner, a user can control a screen, i.e. a GUI displayed on the second display 216 of the mobile device 200 through the head unit device 100.
<br/><br/> The user directly selects an action for the notification by VNC in step S645.  That is, the user selects an action button displayed on the GUI of the head unit device 100.
<br/><br/> In step S650, the mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 100 a notification event message having a launchApp element set to false.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 transmits to the mobile device 200 a TerminateApplication action request message including a TerminateApplication action command having an argument with an appID set to AppID#1 in step S655.  The mobile device 200 then
terminates the application corresponding to AppID#1.
<br/><br/> In step S660, the head unit device 100 transmits to the mobile device 200 a TerminateApplication action request message including a TerminateApplication action command having an argument with an appID set to AppID#2 and the mobile device 200
terminates the application corresponding to AppID#2.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow illustrating an operation for displaying notification event information on a native notification GUI at the head unit device, after the head unit device receives a notification event message from
the mobile device according to an embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 7, upon the occurrence of an event corresponding to any of user-selected notification types, the mobile device 200 transmits a notification event message including notification event information to the head unit device 100 in
step S710.
<br/><br/> In step S715, the head unit device 100 configures a notification GUI based on the contents of the notification event message.
<br/><br/> A user selects an Accept button on the notification GUI in step S720.  That is, the user determines whether to receive a notification service.
<br/><br/> Upon the user selection of a button on the notification GUI, the head unit device 100 transmits to the mobile device 200 an InvokeNotiAction action request message including an InvokeNotiAction action command that has an action ID corresponding
to the button, ActionID and an ID of the notification event message, NotiID as arguments in step S725.
<br/><br/> Applications corresponding to appIDs set in an appIDs element being a child element of the user-selected action are executed sequentially by LaunchApplication actions.  For example, in the presence of a single appID in the appIDs element, the
LaunchApplication action is performed once.  In the presence of two appIDs in the appIDs element, the LaunchApplication action is performed twice.  If an InvokeNotiAction action command as illustrated in Table 6 is used, one InvokeNotiAction action
achieves the same effect as performing the LaunchApplication action once.  Therefore, for example, it is not necessary to additionally transmit a LaunchApplication action request message for executing the application with AppID#1 as its appID.
<br/><br/> In step S730, the head unit device 100 extracts an appIDs element including a notification element set in the notification event message as its parent, extracts appIDs from the appID element based on commas, and transmits to the mobile device
200 a LaunchApplication action request message including a LaunchApplication action command that has the first appID (e.g. AppID#1) of the appIDs element as an argument.
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 100 a response message having a URL at which the VNC client module 190 can access the VNC server module 290, as a return value of the LaunchApplication action command in step S735.  The VNC
URL takes the form of "VNC:// .  . . . "
<br/><br/> In step S740, if the VNC server module 290 is accessible using the VNC URL, the head unit device 100 activates the VNC client module 190 and transmits the VNC URL to the VNC client module 190.  The VNC client module 190 access the VNC server
module 290 through the VNC URL.  Then, the head unit device 100 receives a screen, i.e. a GUI displayed on the display 216 of the mobile device 200 by a VNC connection or streaming.
<br/><br/> In step S745, the head unit device 100 then transmits, to the mobile device 200, a LaunchApplication action request message including a LaunchApplication command having the second (e.g. AppID#2) of the appIDs included in the notification event
message as an argument.
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 100 a response message including an RTP URL as a return value of the LaunchApplication action command, at which the first RTP server/client module 180 can access the second RTP
server/client module 280 in step S750.  The RTP URL takes the form of "RTP:// .  . . . "
<br/><br/> In step S755, if the second RTP server/client module 280 is accessible using the RTP URL, the head unit device 100 activates the first RTP server/client module 180 and transmits the RTP URL to the first RTP server/client module 180.  The first
RTP server/client module 180 can access the second RTP server/client module 280 through the RTP URL.  The head unit device 100 receives voice data of a call incoming at the mobile device 200 or transmit user's voice data of the call to the mobile device
200, by an RTP connection or streaming.
<br/><br/> Once a VNC connection is established in the above manner, a user can control a screen, i.e. a GUI displayed on the second display 216 of the mobile device 200 through the head unit device 100.
<br/><br/> In step S760, the mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 100 an event notification message having a launchApp element set to false.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 transmits to the mobile device 200 a TerminateApplication action request message that includes a TerminateApplication action command having an argument with an appID set to AppID#1 and the mobile device 200 terminates
the application corresponding to AppID#1 in step S765.
<br/><br/> In step S770, the head unit device 100 transmits, to the mobile device 200, a TerminateApplication action request message that includes a TerminateApplication action command having an argument with an appID set to AppID#2 and the mobile device
200 terminates the application corresponding to AppID#2.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow of an operation for displaying notification event information by the VNC at the head unit device, after the head unit device receives a simple notification event message from the mobile device
according to another embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Table 7 below illustrates the data structure of a notification event message.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00007 TABLE 7 Element Description Parent Availability notiEvent Simple notification event message.  -- Required This element contains simple information to let the head unit device know that the notification event has occurred to a
phone.  notiID Unique identifier of Notification notiEvent Required event.  appIDs Comma separated list of notiEvent Required application IDs.  Application ID in the appIDs is unique identifier and MUST be identical with one on A_ARG_TYPE_AppList, and
each application ID has a prefix value between `L` or `T`.  If the Application ID has a prefix value with `L`, the head unit will invoke the LaunchApplication action with the application ID, whereas if it has a prefix value with `T`, the head unit
invokes TerminateApplication action with the application ID.  (A_ARG_TYPE_String)
<br/><br/> The notiEvent element indicates that the transmitted message is a simple notification event message and lets the head unit device 100 know that a notification event has occurred in the mobile device 200.  The notiID element is a unique ID of the
notification event.  The appIDs element provides a comma-separated list of application IDs.  An application ID in the appIDs element is a unique ID and must be identical to one on A_ARG_TYPE_AppList.  Each application ID has a prefix value between "L"
and "T".  If the application ID has the prefix value of "L", the head unit device 100 invokes the LaunchApplication action with the application ID.  On the other hand, if the application ID has the prefix value of "T", the head unit device invokes the
TerminateApplication action with the application ID.  The appIDs element is expressed as A_ARG_TYPE_String.
<br/><br/> The notiEvent element (or notiEvent state variable) indicates to the head unit device 100 that a notification event has occurred in the mobile device 200.  The notification event message includes the notiID element indicating the unique ID of
the event notification, and the appIDs element for directly executing an application such as VNC for the head unit device 100 that does not support a native notification GUI.  The appIDs element includes a plurality of application IDs separated by
commas.  "L" or "T" are added before each application ID.  When "L" is present before an application ID, an application corresponding to the application ID is executed by invoking the LaunchApplication action with the application ID.  When "T" is present
before an application ID, an application corresponding to the application ID is terminated by invoking the TerminateApplication action with the application ID.  Table 8 below illustrates an embodiment of the appIDs element.  The "L" and "T" values are
replaced with other distinguishing values.  For instance, "L" can be replaced with "*" and "T" can be replaced with "$".
<br/><br/> Or, instead of using "L", no tag is added before an application ID to indicate executing an application and "!" is added before the application ID to indicate termination of the application, as illustrated in Table 9.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00008 TABLE 8 ...  &lt;appIDs&gt;L0x01,L0x02,T0x03&lt;/appIDs&gt; ...
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00009 TABLE 9 ...  &lt;appIDs&gt;0x01,0x02,!0x03&lt;/appIDs&gt; ...
<br/><br/> Referring to Table 8, upon receipt of a notification event message having an appIDs element, the head unit device 100 which intends to display a notification GUI by VNC executes an application with an application ID of 0x01 by invoking the
LaunchApplication and subsequently executes an application with an application ID of 0x02 by invoking the LaunchApplication.  On the other hand, the head unit device 100 terminates an application with an application ID of 0x03 by invoking the
TerminateApplication action.
<br/><br/> If the head unit device 100 provides a native notification GUI, it ignores the appIDs element.
<br/><br/> Upon receipt of a notification event message having the above-described data structure, the head unit device 100 sequentially executes or terminates applications by interpreting the appIDs element.
<br/><br/> Upon occurrence of an event corresponding to any of user-selected notification types, the mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 100 a notification event message including notification event information with application IDs of
applications to be executed in step S810.
<br/><br/> In step S815, the head unit device 100 extracts an appIDs element including a notification element in the notification event message as a parent, extracts appIDs from the appIDs element based on commas, and transmits to the mobile device 200 a
LaunchApplication action request message including a LaunchApplication action command with the first appID (e.g., AppID#1) of the appIDs element as an argument.
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 executes an application with AppID#1 by invoking the LaunchApplication action in step S820.  If the application with AppID#1 is being executed, the application is notified at the top of the screen of the mobile device 200. 
The mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 100 a response message including a URL at which the VNC client module 190 can access the VNC server module 290, as a return value of the LaunchApplication action command.  The VNC URL takes the form
of "VNC:// .  . . . "
<br/><br/> In step S825, if the VNC server module 290 is accessible using the VNC URL, the head unit device 100 activates the VNC client module 190 and transmits the VNC URL to the VNC client module 190.  The VNC client module 190 accesses the VNC server
module 290 through the VNC URL.  The head unit device 100 then receives a screen, i.e. a GUI displayed on the display 216 of the mobile device 200 by a VNC connection or streaming.  When the notification GUI of the mobile device 200 is shown on the head
unit device 100 by VNC, the user can control the mobile device 200 by VNC.  Each time the mobile device 200 receives a user input by VNC, the mobile device 200 transmits an event notification message illustrated in Table 7 to the head unit device 100,
when needed.
<br/><br/> In step S830, the user directly selects an action for the notification by VNC.  For example, the user selects an Accept button for an incoming call by VNC.  That is, the user selects the Accept button displayed on the GUI of the head unit device
100.
<br/><br/> In step S835, the mobile device 200 transmits a notification event message to the head unit device 100 in order to implement RTP.  The notification event message includes an appIDs element indicating applications to be executed.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 transmits to the mobile device 100 a LaunchApplication action request message including a LaunchApplication action command with the second appID (e.g., AppID#2) of appIDs included in the notification event message as an
argument in step S840.
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 200 a response message including an RTP URL as a return value of the LaunchApplication action command, at which the first RTP server/client module 180 accesses the second RTP server/client
module 280 in step S845.  The RTP URL takes the form of "RTP:// .  . . . "
<br/><br/> In step S850, if the second RTP server/client module 280 is accessible using the RTP URL, the head unit device 100 activates the first RTP server/client module 180 and transmits the RTP URL to the first RTP server/client module 180.  The first
RTP server/client module 180 accesses the second RTP server/client module 280 through the RTP URL.  Then, the head unit device 100 receives voice data of a call incoming at the mobile device 200 or transmit the user's voice data of the call to the mobile
device 200, by an RTP connection or streaming.  When the user terminates the call on the VNC GUI, the mobile device 200 transmits a notification event message to the head unit device 100 in order to terminate the VNC connection and the RTP connection.
<br/><br/> In step S855, the mobile device 200 transmits a notification event message including IDs of applications to be terminated to the head unit device 100.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 transmits, to the mobile device 200, a TerminateApplication action request message including a TerminateApplication action command that has an argument with an appID set to AppID#1 and the mobile device 200 terminates
the application corresponding to AppID#1 in step S860.
<br/><br/> In step S865, the head unit device 100 transmits to the mobile device 200 a TerminateApplication action request message including a TerminateApplication action command that has an argument with an appID set to AppID#2 and the mobile device 200
terminates the application corresponding to AppID#2.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow illustrating displaying notification event information on a native notification GUI at the head unit device, after the head unit device receives a simple notification event message from the mobile
device according to another embodiment of the present invention.
<br/><br/> Referring to FIG. 9, upon the occurrence of an event corresponding to any of user-selected notification types, the mobile device 200 transmits a notification event message including event notification information to the head unit device 100 in
step S910.
<br/><br/> When the mobile device 200 transmits a notification event message to the head unit device 100, the head unit device 100 has difficulty in configuring a native notification GUI only with information included in the notification event message. 
Therefore, the head unit device 100 acquires additional information about the event by invoking a GetNotification action as illustrated in Table 10 below.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00010 TABLE 10 Argument Direction RelatedStateVariable ProfileID IN A_ARG_TYPE_ProfileID NotiID IN A_ARG_TYPE_NotilD Notification OUT A_ARG_TYPE_Notification
<br/><br/> In step S915, to acquire more detailed notification event information by the GetNotification action, the head unit device 100 includes an event notification ID, NotiID set in the notification event message and a self-generated profile ID in a
GetNotification action request message and transmits the GetNotification action request message to the mobile device 200.
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 100 a notification information message (an event information message or a second notification message) including detailed information about the notification event corresponding to the
NotiID in response to the GetNotification action request message, as illustrated in Table 11 in step S920.

application ID.  (A_ARG_TYPE_String)
<br/><br/> The notification element contains detailed information about an event that has occurred in the mobile device 200 (e.g. a phone) and the detailed information about the event is delivered to the head unit device 100.  The notiID element is a
unique ID of the notification event, expressed as A_ARG_TYPE_notiID.  The notiType element indicates the type of the notification event and is provided by an application initiating the notification.  The notiType element specifies the type of the
notification such as Call, Message, or Alarm etc., expressed as A_ARG_TYPE_String.  The notiStyle element indicates the display style of the notification, which should be one of pop-up, banner, full-screen, hidden styles, and the like.  A hidden style is
when an indicator for the notification is displayed to the user without directly displaying message content to notify the user.  The notiTitle element indicates the type of the notification event.  In other words, it is the name of the event that has
occurred.  For example, the name of the event is a new text message or email, expressed as A_ARG_TYPE_String.  The notiBody element provides the body of the notification event.  It includes detailed information about the event for a user.  For example,
the notiBody element provides text message content for a new text message event or a call ID for an incoming call event, expressed as A_ARG_TYPE_String.  The iconList element provides a list of available application icons.  The icon* element describes an

ID and must be identical to one on A_ARG_TYPE_AppList.  Each application ID has a prefix value between L and T. If the application ID has the prefix value of L, the head unit device 100 invokes the LaunchApplication action with the application ID. 
However, if the application ID has the prefix value of T, the head unit device 100 invokes the TerminateApplication action with the application ID.  If the notification information message includes the actions element, the appIDs element has an empty
string value.  The appIDs element is expressed as A_ARG_TYPE_String.  The priority element indicates the priority of the notification.  It has one of values "normal" and "emergency", expressed as A_ARG_TYPE_String.  The actions element provides a list of
actions for the notification.  The list is provided by an application initiating the notification so that a user directly selects one of the actions for the notification.  For example, the user can reply to a new text message or ignore it.  The list
includes "Reply" and "Ignore" actions as its elements.  The actions element is only used in the notification information message, when the head unit device 100 shows its own notification UI with buttons to get a user input.  Otherwise, the mobile device
200 should not include this element in the notification information message.  The actionID element is a unique ID of an action, expressed as A_ARG_TYPE_ActionID.  When a user selects an action for the notification through the native notification UI
serviced by the head unit device 100, the actionID element should be transmitted to the mobile device 200.  The actionName element is the name of an action.  The name is shown as a button on the native notification GUI.  The appIDs element provides a
comma-separated list of application IDs.  An application ID in the appIDs element is a unique ID and must be identical to one on A_ARG_TYPE_AppList.  Each application ID has a prefix value between "L" and "T".  If the application ID has the prefix value
of "L", the head unit device 100 invokes the LaunchApplication action with the application ID.  However, if the application ID has the prefix value of "T", the head unit device invokes the TerminateApplication action with the application ID.  The appIDs
element is expressed as A_ARG_TYPE_String.
<br/><br/> In step S925, the head unit device 100 configures a notification GUI based on the contents of the notification information message.  Among the elements of the notification information message, the actions element is used in configuring a button
through which a user input is received, when the head unit device 100 configures its own notification GUI based on the notification information message.  In other cases, the actions element is not included in the notification information message.  In the
presence of the actions element, the appIDs element having a notification element as a parent has an empty string.  However, in the absence of the actions element, the appIDs element includes application IDs to be executed or terminated according to a
rule, and the head unit device 100 sequentially executes or terminates the application IDs included in the appIDs element.
<br/><br/> In step S930, the user selects an Accept button on the notification GUI.
<br/><br/> Upon the user selection of a button on the notification GUI, the head unit device 100 transmits to the mobile device 200 an InvokeNotiAction action request message including an InvokeNotiAction action command that has ActionID corresponding to
the button and the ID of the notification event message, NotiID as arguments.  The InvokeNotiAction action has the following arguments as listed in Table 12 below.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00012 TABLE 12 Argument Direction relatedStateVariable ProfileID IN A_ARG_TYPE_ProfileID NotiID IN A_ARG_TYPE_NotiID ActionID IN A_ARG_TYPE_ActionID ActionResult OUT A_ARG_TYPE_Bool
<br/><br/> In step S940, the mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 100 a response message including a Boolean value indicating true or false for the result of the action, ActionResult.
<br/><br/> If ActionResult is true, the head unit device 100 extracts appIDs from the notification information message received by invoking the GetNotification action and sequentially executes applications such as VNC, RTP, and the like.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 extracts the appIDs element including the notification element included in the notification information message as a parent, extracts appIDs from the appIDs element based on commas, and transmits a LaunchApplication
action request message including an LaunchApplication command having the first (e.g., AppID#1) of the appIDs as an argument to the mobile device 200 in step S945.
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 200 a response message including a URL as a return value of the LaunchApplication command, at which the VNC client module 190 can access the VNC server module 290 in step S950.  The VNC URL
takes the form of "VNC:// .  . . . "
<br/><br/> In step S955, if the VNC server module 290 is accessible using the VNC URL, the head unit device 100 activates the VNC client module 190 and transmits the VNC URL to the VNC client module 190.  The VNC client module 190 accesses the VNC server
module 290 through the VNC URL.  Then, the head unit device 100 receives a screen, i.e. a GUI displayed on the display 216 of the mobile device 200 by a VNC connection or streaming.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 then transmits to the mobile device 200 a LaunchApplication action request message including an LaunchApplication command having the second (e.g. AppID#2) of the appIDs included in the notification event message as an
argument in step S960.
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 200 a response message including an RTP URL as a return value of the LaunchApplication action command, at which the first RTP server/client module 180 can access the second RTP
server/client module 280 in step S965.  The RTP URL takes the form of "RTP:// .  . . . "
<br/><br/> In step S970, if the second RTP server/client module 280 is accessible using the RTP URL, the head unit device 100 activates the first RTP server/client module 180 and transmits the RTP URL to the first RTP server/client module 180.  The first
RTP server/client module 180 accesses the second RTP server/client module 280 through the RTP URL.  Then, the head unit device 100 receives voice data of a call incoming at the mobile device 200 or transmit user's voice data of the call to the mobile
device 200, by an RTP connection or streaming.
<br/><br/> Once a VNC connection is established in the above manner, a user controls a screen, i.e., a GUI displayed on the second display 216 of the mobile device 200 through the head unit device 100.
<br/><br/> To terminate specific applications, the mobile device 200 transmits a notification event message to the head unit device 100 in step S975.
<br/><br/> To get more detailed event notification information by invoking the GetNotification action, the head unit device 100 includes an event notification ID, NotiID set in the notification event message and a profile ID in a GetNotification action
request message and transmits the GetNotification action request message to the mobile device 200 in step S980.
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 100 a notification information message including detailed information about an event corresponding to the NotiID as illustrated in (Table 11) in response to the GetNotification action
request message in step S985.
<br/><br/> Because the head unit device 100 does not need to show button information to the user through its own notification GUI, the detailed notification information message does not include an actions element and includes application IDs to be
terminated along with a tag value ("L" or "T", herein "T" is added before an application ID) in an appIDs element having a notification element as a parent in a notification information message and transmits the notification information message to the
head unit device 100.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 terminates the related applications by analyzing the appIDs element.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 transmits to the mobile device 200 a TerminateApplication action request message that includes a TerminateApplication action command having an argument with an appID set to AppID#1 and the mobile device 200 terminates
the application corresponding to AppID#1 in step S990.
<br/><br/> In step S995, the head unit device 100 transmits to the mobile device 200 a TerminateApplication action request message that includes a TerminateApplication action command having an argument with an appID set to AppID#2 and the mobile device 200
terminates the application corresponding to AppID#2.
<br/><br/> If the head unit device 100 is to be configured to operate uniformly, irrespective of whether it provides a notification GUI or not, the mobile device 200 transmits only a notification ID, notiID to the head unit device 100, instead of a
notiEvent state variable, and the head unit device 100 always acquires detailed information about an event notification by the GetNotification action.  Herein, the argument is the received notification ID.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow for supporting a plurality of types of notification services with one application.
<br/><br/> When the head unit device 100 is connected to the mobile device 200, it receives an application list from the mobile device 200 and stores the application list.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 transmits an action request message to the mobile device 200 in step S1010.  The action request message includes a GetApplicationList action command requesting an application list.
<br/><br/> In step S1015, the mobile device 200 transmits the application list, ApplicationList to the head unit device 100.
<br/><br/> If the head unit device 100 wants to receive notifications for user-desired applications and their notification types, the head unit device 100 receives an application list supporting the notification service by an GetNotiApplicationList action
with the following arguments listed in Table 13 below.
<br/><br/> In step S1020, the head unit device 100 transmits to the mobile device 200 an action request message including a GetNotiApplicationList action command requesting a notification-supporting application list.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00013 TABLE 13 Argument Direction relatedStateVariable ProfileID IN A_ARG_TYPE_ProfileID NotiAppList OUT A_ARG_TYPE_NotiAppList
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 transmits the notification-supporting application list, NotiAppList to the head unit device 100 in response to the GetNotiApplicationList action command in step S1025.  The notification-supporting application list,
NotiAppList has a data structure illustrated in Table 14 below.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00014 TABLE 14 Element Description Parent Availability notiAppList Application List supporting a -- Required notification.  notiApp* Entry describing one remote notiAppList Required application supporting a notification appID Unique
application ID notiApp Required NotiTypes Comma separated list of notiApp Required notification types.  One application can support several notification types (e.g., "call, sms, <b><i>facebook,</i></b> twitter".  It cannot be an empty string.  (A_ARG_TYPE_String)
<br/><br/> The notiAppList element indicates an application list supporting notification.  The notiApp element describes a remote application supporting notification.  The appID element provides a unique application ID.  The NotiTypes element provides a
comma-separated list of notification types.  One application can support several notification types, for example, Call, SMS, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, etc. and it should not be an empty string.  It can be expressed as A_ARG_TYPE_String.  Table 14 includes IDs
of applications supporting the notification service, and notification types supported by each application.  The mobile device 200 configures XML values as illustrated in Table 14 by the procedure illustrated in FIG. 3 and transmits the XML values to the
head unit device 100 by the GetNotiApplicationList action.
<br/><br/> In step S1030, the head unit device 100 compares the application list ApplicationList resulting from the GetApplicationList action with the notification-supporting application list NotiAppList.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 displays the application list supporting the notification service to a user on a screen, that is, a notification GUI in step S1035.  When necessary, notification types supported by each application are also be displayed.
<br/><br/> In step S1040, the user selects an application and/or a notification type on the displayed notification GUI.
<br/><br/> The head unit device 100 transmits a SetNotiConfiguration action request message to the mobile device 200 in step S1045.  The SetNotiConfiguration action request message includes user-selected notification types and a SetNotiConfiguration action
command requesting registration of these notification types.
<br/><br/> The user selects desired applications and select desired notification types from among the notification types supported by each application.  The selected values are set as arguments of the SetNotiConfiguration action as illustrated in Table 15
below and transmitted to the mobile device 200.  The mobile device 200 internally stores the received arguments.  The mobile device 200 then transmits only the user-desired notifications based on the arguments to the head unit device 100.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00015 TABLE 15 Argument Direction relatedStateVariable NotiAppList IN A_ARG_TYPE_NotiAppList MinPriority IN A_ARG_TYPE_String ProfileID IN A_ARG_TYPE_ProfileID
<br/><br/> If the user does not receive notifications selectively but wants to receive all notifications from the mobile device 200, the head unit device 100 sets the value of the NotiAppList argument to "*" (a default value).
<br/><br/> Table 16 lists arguments of a GetNotiConfiguration action invoked for the head unit device 100 to receive a value set by the SetNotiConfiguration action or a value set and stored by the mobile device 200.
<br/><br/> TABLE-US-00016 TABLE 16 Argument Direction relatedStateVariable ProfileID IN A_ARG_TYPE_ProfileID NotiAppList OUT A_ARG_TYPE_NotiAppList MinPriority OUT A_ARG_TYPE_String
<br/><br/> Upon the completion of settings for the notification by the SetNotiConfiguration action, the head unit device 100 subscribes in order to receive a notification from the mobile device 200.  The subscription operation can be performed at any time
after the head unit device 100 discovers the mobile device 200.  Thereafter, the head unit device 100 receives notification event information from the mobile device 200.
<br/><br/> In step S1050, the head unit device 100 transmits a subscription message requesting subscription to an ML notification service to the mobile device 200.
<br/><br/> The mobile device 200 transmits to the head unit device 100 a notification event message including event notification information, only when an event notification occurs regarding the user-selected notification types in step S1055.
<br/><br/> According to the present invention, notifications regarding an incoming/outgoing call, a new message, a device status alarm at a specific danger level, etc. can be transmitted unidirectionally or bidirectionally between a head unit device and a
mobile device in an in-vehicle environment.  Therefore, user convenience is increased.
<br/><br/> In the foregoing embodiments of the present invention, modules may be devices.
<br/><br/> The embodiments of the present invention can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software.  The software can be recorded to a volatile or non-volatile storage device such as a ROM irrespective of whether they
