<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> This disclosure generally relates to rendering and displaying texts on electronic devices.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> For any type of electronic devices that incorporates display screens, it is most likely that some texts need to be rendered and displayed on the screens of the devices while the devices are operational.  The texts may be in various languages or
of various font styles. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example system for rendering and displaying texts on electronic devices.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an example method for rendering and displaying texts on electronic devices.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an example sentence written in several different languages.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates several example text units, each divided into a number of text blocks.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 illustrates an example coordinate system for offsets, in relation to a specific reference coordinate, associated with text blocks.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6.  illustrates several example text blocks and their respectively associated offsets.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 illustrates an example method for displaying input texts entered by users on electronic devices.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 illustrates an example computer system.
<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, texts are rendered for display on the screen of an electronic device.  For example, the electronic device may be a desktop computer, a game or test console, or a mobile device (e.g., a notebook computer, a network
computer, a tablet computer, a mobile telephone, or a personal digital assistant).  The texts may be in any language or font style.  In particular embodiments, a set of texts (e.g., a word, a phrase a sentence, or a paragraph) is divided into a number of
text blocks, with each text block including a portion of the texts.  Each text block is rendered for display (e.g., as a bitmap or raster image) on the screen of the electronic device.  Optionally, each rendered text block is compressed.  In addition, an
placement instruction is determined for each rendered text block, which indicates the position of the rendered text block (e.g., an offset in relation to a reference coordinate) when the text block is displayed on the screen of the electronic device. 
The rendered text blocks and their respectively associated placement instructions are sent to the electronic device to be displayed.
<br/><br/> For any electronic device that includes a screen, it is likely that some texts need to be displayed on the screen of the device while the device is operational.  The texts may be in any written language or any font style.  While it is relatively
easy to render and display some languages (e.g., English, French, German, Spanish, or Italian) on electronic devices, other languages may present additional problems and challenges.  For example, some languages are written from right to left (e.g.,
Hebrew) or top to bottom (e.g., traditional Chinese).  Some languages are character based (e.g., Chinese) or script based (e.g., Arabic or Hindi).  Some languages have complicated alphabets (e.g., Arabic, Thai, Hindi).  Rendering and displaying texts
written in such complex languages may require complicated analysis, computation, or processing.  On the other hand, certain types of electronic devices, such as low-end mobile telephones, may not possess sufficient resources (e.g., processor power or
memory) to adequately render texts written in such complex languages.  For example, it may take a very long time to render such texts that results in inconvenient or unacceptable delays to the user of the device.
<br/><br/> For some languages, especially the more complex languages, it may not be feasible, or feasible but inefficient, to store all the font representations of that language, along with the rendering logic, on a client device.  The number of character
combinations can be very large, and handling such languages may consume a great amount of resources of the client device.  The rendering logic needed for rendering texts in such languages may be very complex and involved, thus consuming a lot of device
resources (e.g., in terms of processing power and memory).
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates an example system 100 for rendering and displaying texts on electronic devices.  This system is suitable for displaying texts written in any language or any font and on any electronic device with a screen.  In particular
embodiments, system 100 may include a number of servers (e.g., servers 111, 113, 115).  Each server may be a unitary server or may be a distributed server spanning multiple computers or multiple datacenters.  Each server may include hardware, software,
or embedded logic components or a combination of two or more such components and capable of carrying out the appropriate functionalities implemented or supported by the server.  In some implementations, each server may implement different
functionalities.  For example, server 111 may be a "content" server that is responsible for creating, collecting, or compiling the texts to be displayed on various electronic devices.  As an example, upon receiving a request for a web page, server 111
may dynamically construct the requested web page, which may include some texts.  Server 113 may be a "gateway" server that is responsible for processing the texts.  This may include adapting the texts for a specific device where the texts are to be
displayed, or rendering the texts (e.g., as bitmap or raster images) for a specific type of device.  Server 113 may receive texts for further processing from server 111.  Server 115 may be a "language" server that is responsible for further processing
the rendered texts based on their written structure, such as dividing the texts into text blocks and determining the placement instruction for each text block.  Server 115 may receive the rendered texts for further processing from server 115.
<br/><br/> Note that for different implementations, the specific functionalities implemented by each server 111, 113, 115 may differ.  For example, in some implementations, the functionalities of servers 113 and 115 (e.g., rendering texts, dividing texts
into text blocks and determining placement instruction for each text block) may be combined to be implemented by the same server.  In some implementations, some functionalities may be optimized.  The functionalities implemented by servers 111, 113, and
115 are described in more detail below in connection with FIG. 2.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, server 115 may send text blocks and their associated placement instructions to an electronic device 121 (i.e., a client device) over a computer or communications network 130 (e.g., the Internet) so that electronic
device 121 may display the corresponding texts on its screen.  In particular embodiments, electronic device 121 may include hardware, software, or embedded logic components or a combination of two or more such components and capable of carrying out the
appropriate functionalities implemented or supported by electronic device 121.  In some implementations, electronic device 121 may be a mobile device, such as, for example and without limitation, a notebook, netbook, or tablet computer, a mobile
telephone, or a game or test console, which may connect to network 130 wirelessly.  For example, if electronic device 121 is a mobile telephone, it may connect to a second generation (2G), third generation (3G), or fourth generation (4G) cellular
network.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, servers 111, 113, and 115 may be a part of a social-networking system, which implements and hosts a social-networking website.  A social network, in general, is a social structure made up of entities, such as
individuals or organizations, that are connected by one or more types of interdependency or relationships, such as friendship, kinship, common interest, financial exchange, dislike, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge, or prestige.  In more recent
years, social networks have taken advantage of the Internet.  There are social-networking systems existing on the Internet in the form of social-networking websites.  Such social-networking websites enable their members, who are commonly referred to as
website users, to perform various social activities.  For example, the social-networking website operated by <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Inc.  at www.facebook.com enables its users to communicate with their friends via emails, instant messages, or blog postings, organize
social events, share photos, receive news of their friends or interesting events, play games, etc. Each user of the social-networking system may maintain any number of user accounts with the system.  Each user account is identified by a unique user
identifier (ID) or username, and access to the user account may be controlled by a password.  To log into a specific user account, a user needs to provide the correct combination of user ID and password associated with the account.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a user of electronic device 121 may be such a user of the social-networking system.  In some implementations, the user of electronic device 121 may register or link electronic device 121 to his user account with the
social-networking system.  For example, the user may specify the serial number, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or Media Access Control (MAC) address of electronic device 121, or if electronic device 121 is a mobile telephone, the telephone number
assigned to electronic device 121 in his user account with the social-networking system.  In addition, the user may specify his preferred language (e.g., English, French, Russian or Chinese) for communication.  This information may also be stored with
his user account and thus accessible to the social-networking system and its servers (e.g., servers 111, 113, and 115).  In some cases, such information may help processing and rendering the texts to be displayed on electronic device 121, as described in
more detail below in connection with FIG. 2.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an example method for rendering and displaying texts on electronic devices.  Suppose that there are some texts that need to be displayed on a client electronic device (e.g., electronic device 121, which may be a mobile
device).  This may be in response to a client request (e.g., the client device requests some information from a server) or may be the result of a server initiative (e.g., a server wants to send a notification or message to the client device).  In
particular embodiments, a server (e.g., server 111) may compile the texts to be displayed on the client device (as illustrated in STEP 210).  The texts may be written in any human language (e.g., alphabet based or character based) and in any font.  The
font of the texts may depend on the actual language the texts are in. For example, if the texts are in English, the font of the texts may be "Times New Roman", "Arial" or "Courier New".  If the texts are in Chinese, the font of the texts may be "SimSun",
"Han Ding", "Yellow Bridge", or "Song".  If the texts are in Hebrew, the font may be "Narkisim", "Darbooka", or "Hofim".  In some implementations, the texts are represented using a TrueType font.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 illustrates an example sentence written in several different languages, including English, Arabic, traditional Chinese, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Korean, Russian, Thai, and Vietnamese.  This illustrates how vastly different human written
languages can be from each other, in terms of, for example, their structures (e.g., alphabet based vs.  character based vs.  script based), styles (e.g., left to right, right to left, top to bottom), and looks.  Traditionally, electronically
representing, rendering, and displaying these different written languages require different and special processing and handling by the individual electronic devices.  With the present disclosure, however, the same process may be applied to rendering and
displaying texts in any written language and any font, regardless of its specific structure or style, as well as on any type of electronic devices.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, given a set of texts (e.g., a word, a phrase, a sentence, or a paragraph), the texts may be divided into a number (e.g., one or more) of text units (as illustrated in STEP 220).  In some implementations, a text unit
may be determined based on the structure of the specific written language the texts are in. For example, if the language is alphabet based (e.g., English, Greek, Russian), a text unit may be an individual alphabet in that language.  On the other hand, if
the language is character based (e.g. Chinese), a text unit may be an individual character in that language.  If the language is script based (e.g., Arabic, Hindi), a text unit may be an individual symbol in that language or a script group based on the
natural grouping of the scripts and the locations of the breaks between the scripts.  Each text unit is then further divided into a number (e.g., one or more) of text blocks (as illustrated in STEP 230).  Each text block may include at least a portion of
the text unit, and all the text blocks together cover the entire text unit.  In some implementations, a text block may be determined based on the structure of the specific written language the texts are in. For example, with either traditional or
simplified Chinese, there are a number of character parts, and each character is usually a combination of one or more such character parts.  In this case, a text block may be an individual character part.  In some implementations, if the language has a
Unicode representation, a text block may be an individual glyph (e.g., a writing element) that has a corresponding Unicode value.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates the same example sentence as illustrated in FIG. 3 written in Tamil, which is a script-based language.  STEPS 220 and 230 are further explained using this example writing.  In this case, the set of texts is a single sentence. 
The current Tamil script consists of 12 vowels, 18 consonants, and one special character, the ytam.  The vowels and consonants combine to form 216 compound characters, given a total of 247 characters.  Based on this structure of the Tamil writing system,
each text unit in this language may be either a vowel or a consonant or the special character or a punctuation mark.  In FIG. 4, the sentence is divided into 19 text units (e.g., 410, 420, 430) because there are a total of 19 vowels, consonants, and
punctuation mark included in the sentence.
<br/><br/> Each text unit (e.g., a vowel or consonant or punctuation mark) is then further divided into one or more text blocks.  As an example, consider text unit 410, which is a vowel ("").  This text unit is further divided into 3 text blocks, 411, 412,
and 413, as marked by the dash-line rectangles.  In some cases, two text blocks may partially overlap so that they share a common, and usually small, portion of the text unit.  For example, text blocks 411 and 412 overlap with each other, while text
block 413 overlaps with both text blocks 411 and 412.  With some languages, such overlaps between text blocks may be needed, at times, in order to adequately cover each text unit or efficiently render and display each text unit.  With some languages
(e.g., Chinese), such overlaps between text blocks may not be necessary because of the structural characteristics of these languages.  Text blocks 411, 412, and 413 together cover the entire text unit 411.  Similarly, for text unit 420, it is further
divided into 4 text blocks, 421, 422, 423, and 424.  Text block 421 includes the dot (".cndot.") portion of text unit 420 and does not overlap with any other text block.  On the other hand, text block 423 overlaps with both text blocks 422 and 424, while
there is no overlap between text blocks 422 and 424.  The 4 text blocks, 421, 422, 423, and 424, together cover the entire text unit 420.  Text unit 430 is further divided into 3 text blocks, 431, 432, and 433, which together cover the entire text unit
430.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, each text block of each text unit is rendered for display on the client device (as illustrated in STEP 240).  In some implementations, each text block may be rendered as a bitmap or raster image.  For example, in FIG.
4, each square grid 450 may represent a pixel grid on the screen of a client device.  For text unit 410, each of its text blocks 411, 412, 413 may occupy some of the pixels in grid 450A.  For text unit 420, each of its text blocks 421, 422, 423, 424 may
occupy some of the pixels in grid 450B.  For text unit 430, each of its text blocks 431, 432, 433 may occupy some of the pixels in grid 450C.  In some implementations, if the texts are in a TrueType font with a specific font size, each text block may be
rendered based on the corresponding font definition.
<br/><br/> In some implementations, the screen size and resolution of the client device may be taken into consideration when rendering the text blocks.  For example, if the screen of the client device is relatively wide, then more text units may fit into a
single line on the screen, and vice versa.  Thus, given the same sentence in the same font, for some devices, it may fit into a single line on their screens, while for other devices, it may need to be broken into multiple lines.  Consequently, the
position of each text block, when it is displayed on the screen of a client device, may vary between different devices.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the user of the client device may be a member of a social-networking system and may register his client device with his user account with the social-networking system.  In this case, when a server associated with the
social-networking system needs to render texts for the specific client device associated with the user, the server may access information about the client device stored in the user's account (e.g., the device's screen size and resolution) in order to
determine how best to represent and display the texts on the screen of the specific client device (e.g., text layouts and placements on the device's screen).  In addition, the user may specify a preferred language for communication in his user account. 
In this case, when compiling texts to be displayed on this user's device, the server may translate the texts into the language preferred by the user, if necessary, before rendering the texts.
<br/><br/> Suppose that a set of text blocks have been rendered to be displayed on the screen of a specific device.  Each rendered text block, when displayed on the device's screen, should be placed at a specific position and occupies a specific number of
pixels.  Consequently, given a set of text blocks together representing a text unit, when these text blocks are displayed at their respective positions on the device's screen, they together should illustrate the corresponding text unit.  Similarly, given
multiple sets of text blocks, each set representing a different text unit in, for example, a sentence, when all the text blocks are displayed at their respective positions on the device's screen, they together should illustrate the corresponding
sentence.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a number (e.g., one or more) of reference coordinates may be determined for the device's screen.  In some implementations, an X-Y coordinate system may be employed.  For example, a device's screen, which is usually a
rectangle, may be incorporated into an X-Y coordinate system.  Each pixel on the screen may be considered a single unit along either the X-axis or the Y-axis.  The (0, 0) coordinate may be the lower-left pixel or the center pixel of the screen.  Each
reference coordinate may reference a specific pixel on the screen, and thus has a specific X-Y coordinate.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, for each rendered text block, a placement instruction is determined (as illustrated in STEP 240).  In some implementation, the placement instruction of a rendered text block may be represented as an offset in relation
to one of the reference coordinates.  Consider the example X-Y coordinate system illustrated in FIG. 5, which may be applied to a device's screen.  In this case, the origin of the coordinate system is the lower-left pixel of the screen.  There is a
reference position (e.g., a specific pixel) 510 on the screen, which has a reference coordinate (e.g., (14, 10)).  There are a number of text blocks 520, and each has an offset in relation to reference coordinate 510.  For example, for each text block
520, its offset may be represented as a vector starting from reference coordinate 510 and ending at the lower-left corner (or alternatively, the center or one of the other corners) of text block 520.  Each offset vector has a direction and a magnitude.
<br/><br/> The reference coordinates may be selected based on different criteria.  For example, in some implementations, the reference coordinates may correspond to the current cursor positions, respectively.  As an example, for some Latin-based languages,
as each alphabet is displayed sequentially, the current cursor position advances to the starting position of the next alphabet to be displayed, from left to right and top to bottom on the screen.  Each new cursor position may correspond to a different
reference coordinate.  In some implementations, the reference coordinates may be selected in an effort to decrease or minimize the amount of data used to represent the offset vectors of the individual text blocks.  For example, all the text blocks may be
divided into a number of groups based on their respective positions on the device's screen, where text blocks that are positioned near each other are grouped together.  For each group of text blocks, a reference coordinate is selected (e.g., at or near
the centroid point of the text blocks in the group).  The offset vector of each text block is determined in relation to the reference coordinate that is closest to that text block.  As a result, each offset vector's direction and magnitude values may be
sufficiently small that they may be represented using a small number of bits (e.g., 4 bits).
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, given a set of texts (e.g., a word, a phrase, a sentence, or a paragraph), the texts may thus be represented as a sequence of rendered text blocks, each associated with a placement instruction (e.g., an offset in
relation to a specific reference coordinate).  FIG. 6 illustrates such an example sequence of text blocks 520, each associated with an offset vector 620 in relation to a specific reference coordinate.  In some implementations, there may be multiple
reference coordinates for a set of texts.  Some text blocks may have offsets in relation to one reference coordinate, while other text blocks may have offsets in relation to another reference coordinate.  Thus, the sequence may include a number of
special tokens 610, each positioned at an appropriate place in the sequence, that indicate that the current reference coordinate should advance to the next appropriate reference coordinate.  For example, in FIG. 6, text blocks 520A all have offsets in
relation to one reference coordinate, while text blocks 520B all have offsets in relation to another reference coordinate.  Thus, after all the text blocks 520A, there is a special token 610A indicating that the current reference coordinate should
advance to the next reference coordinate, which is associated with text blocks 520B.  Similarly, after all the text blocks 520B, there is another special token 610B indicating that the current reference coordinate should again advance to the next
reference coordinate.  In some implementations, the reference coordinates may also be included in the sequence itself.  For example, in FIG. 6, at the position in the sequence corresponding to special token 610A, the reference coordinate associated with
text blocks 520B may be included.  Similarly, at the position in the sequence corresponding to special token 610B, another reference coordinate associated with the next group of text blocks (not shown) may be included.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, each rendered text block (e.g., a bitmap or raster image) may be compressed in an attempt to decrease the amount of data needed to represent the text blocks using a suitable compression algorithm (as illustrated in
STEP 250).  The sequence of rendered text blocks, optionally compressed, and their associated offsets may be sent to the client device for display on the device's screen (as illustrated in STEP 260).  In addition, the reference coordinates used by the
rendered text blocks may also be sent to the client device, either together with the rendered text blocks or separately.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the rendered text blocks are compressed in such a way that the client device can display the rendered text blocks without having to uncompressed them first.  In particular embodiments, the client device may cache some
of the rendered text blocks received from the server (e.g., groups of text blocks covering frequently used alphabets or characters in a specific language).  As an example, with English, the letter "e" appears frequently in various words.  Thus, the
client device may cache the set of rendered text blocks that represents the letter "e".  As another example, with some languages, there may be specific glyphs that are frequently and repeatedly used in different alphabets or characters.  Thus, the client
device may cache the rendered text blocks corresponding to these frequently-used glyphs.  If the client device has more resources (e.g., more memory), it can cache a relatively large number of text blocks.  As a result, the server only needs to send
rendered text blocks not already available with the client device.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, given a set of texts, it may first be divided into text blocks, and then each text block is rendered for display on a client device, as described in connection with FIG. 2.  Alternatively, in other embodiments, the texts may
first be rendered for display on a client device and then divided into individual text blocks.  In either case, each rendered text block is associated with an offset (e.g., a vector) in relation to a specific reference coordinate.
<br/><br/> With FIG. 2, in particular embodiments, the texts to be displayed on the client device originate from a server.  The process may similarly be applied to display texts inputted to a client device by its user.  FIG. 7 illustrates an example method
for displaying input texts entered by users on electronic devices.
<br/><br/> Suppose that a user of a client device wishes to input texts to the device (as illustrated in STEP 710).  The client device may display a text input field on its screen (as illustrated in STEP 720).  The user may type texts in the input field
using a keypad or an on-screen character map, and the client device may receive the user input (as illustrated in STEP 730).  In particular embodiments, the client device may send the user's text input to a server to be rendered using the process
illustrated in FIG. 2 (as illustrated in STEP 740).  In some implementations, the user's text input may be represented as a sequence of keystrokes.  As described above, the server may divide the text input into text blocks, render each text block,
compress each text block, and determine an offset for each text block.  The server may then send a sequence of rendered text blocks together with their associated offsets, which represent the user's text input, back to the client device (as illustrated
in STEP 750).  The client device, upon receiving the rendered text blocks together with their associated offsets, may display the texts on its screen (as illustrated in STEP 760).
<br/><br/> By using the process illustrated in FIG. 7, a client device no longer needs to implement special functionalities to support and handle user input in various languages.  For example, the same version of a mobile telephone may be distributed and
sold in many different countries speaking different languages.  The mobile telephones rely on the servers to process and render texts in different languages and fonts.  The mobile telephones only need to display already rendered text blocks based on the
information (e.g., reference coordinates, offsets) provided by the servers.
<br/><br/> For some languages, rendered text blocks may be cached and reused by client devices.  For example, with Korean, there is a relatively small set of "character parts" (or Korean alphabets) that may be combined differently to form different words. 
Each character part may be represented as a text block.  A client device may, for example, cache some or all of the rendered text blocks representing these character parts.  Then, to form different words, the server only needs to send the client device
the appropriate placement instructions (e.g., offsets in relation to reference coordinates) for the specific rendered text blocks representing the specific character parts.  The client device may reuse the rendered text blocks by positioning and
displaying them at multiple positions on the screen based on the placement instructions received from the server.  For example, if a specific character part is used to form three different words (e.g., combined with other character parts), the server may
send three different placement instructions indicating three appropriate positions on the client device's screen where that character part should be placed.  The client device may then display the rendered text block representing that character part at
these three positions.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, when displaying some texts, if a client device needs a rendered text block that is already available on the client device (e.g., the client device has a cached copy of the rendered text block), the server only needs to
send the placement instructions for that rendered text block to the client.  On the other hand, if the client device needs a rendered text block that is not yet available to the client device (e.g., the client device has not cached this particular
rendered text block or has never received this rendered text block from the server), the server needs to send the rendered text block (e.g., in compressed form) as well as its associated placement instructions to the client.  As described above, in some
implementations, the placement instructions are represented in such a away that it does not take too many bits to encode the information.  On the other hand, the rendered text blocks (e.g., as bitmap or raster images), even in compressed form, may
require a relatively large number of bytes to encode.  While sending both rendered text blocks and their associated placement instructions may slightly increase the amount of data initially sent from a server to a client device, since the client device
can cache the rendered text blocks for reuse, subsequently, only new placement instructions need to be sent.  In the long term, this decreases the total amount of data the sever needs to send to the client.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, the entire language-specific logic is maintained and managed by the servers.  The clients are kept language neutral and do not need to worry about processing texts in different languages.  In fact, the clients may not
have any concept of the languages being rendered.  They receive rendered text blocks (e.g., as images) from the servers and follow the placement instructions (e.g., offsets) provided by the servers in order to place the rendered text blocks at the
correct positions on the screens.  Because all the language and font processing is done on the server side, if there is any problem or improvement after a client has been installed, the user does not need to reinstall a new client.  The server can send
the updated rendered text blocks and placement instructions to the client when needed.
<br/><br/> Particular embodiments may be implemented on one or more computer systems.  FIG. 8 illustrates an example computer system 800, which may implement servers 111, 113, or 115 illustrated in FIG. 1.  In particular embodiments, one or more computer

<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, memory 804 includes main memory for storing instructions for processor 802 to execute or data for processor 802 to operate on.  As an example and not by way of limitation, computer system 800 may load instructions from
storage 806 or another source (such as, for example, another computer system 800) to memory 804.  Processor 802 may then load the instructions from memory 804 to an internal register or internal cache.  To execute the instructions, processor 802 may
retrieve the instructions from the internal register or internal cache and decode them.  During or after execution of the instructions, processor 802 may write one or more results (which may be intermediate or final results) to the internal register or

806 or elsewhere) and operates only on data in one or more internal registers or internal caches or in memory 804 (as opposed to storage 806 or elsewhere).  One or more memory buses (which may each include an address bus and a data bus) may couple
processor 802 to memory 804.  Bus 812 may include one or more memory buses, as described below.  In particular embodiments, one or more memory management units (MMUs) reside between processor 802 and memory 804 and facilitate accesses to memory 804
requested by processor 802.  In particular embodiments, memory 804 includes random access memory (RAM).  This RAM may be volatile memory, where appropriate.  Where appropriate, this RAM may be dynamic RAM (DRAM) or static RAM (SRAM).  Moreover, where
appropriate, this RAM may be single-ported or multi-ported RAM.  This disclosure contemplates any suitable RAM.  Memory 804 may include one or more memories 804, where appropriate.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular memory,
