       <p> A system is described for improving decision making for individuals,
     groups and organizations. The system enables participants to
     collaboratively provide informational statements as well as supporting
     and opposing arguments and share them and then rate them. The system
     visually facilitates participants prioritizing arguments, and allows
     participants to rate arguments on clarity, agreement, and relevance. The
     system includes multiple levels of authority, both inherent and
     topic-assignable, which enable posts to be made visible/invisible based
     on authority level and/or "need to know". The system allows decision
     makers to increase the reach of participants in decisions while keeping
     the input and process manageable yielding better decisions. All posts,
     ratings, and edits of posts and ratings within the system are archived
     along with any reasons given, and archives are reviewable by users.

<br/><br/> The field of the invention relates to software-assisted decision making, public debate, structured arguments, and more specifically to multi-user software for engaging in debate and evaluation of assertions.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> Individuals, groups and organizations make decisions on a daily basis.  Good decisions require an evaluation of pros and cons supporting and opposing a decision.  The implementation of decisions is typically more successful when parties
responsible for implementation are involved in the decision-making process early and can raise pros and cons as well.  Unfortunately, it can be difficult to coordinate groups of people, truly understand their positions on issues and come to an optimal
decision.
<br/><br/> There are many tools which can provide information for decision making, such as search engines and wikis, and there are many tools for getting feedback, such as surveys or blogs, and there are even decision making analysis tools which help with
a number of these issues.  However, human beings do not always make decisions based on logic and these tools often do not help identify and distinguish emotional from logical reasoning.
<br/><br/> There is a need for technologies which assist individuals to better understand their own positions on issues, and technologies that help them better explain those positions to others.  There is also a need for innovative tools that help group or
organization decision makers to better understand their constituents' preferences and reasons for those preferences.
<br/><br/> Within any debate or topic analysis, people may attempt to bias decision-making by hiding information, presenting information in a biased way, etc. There is a need for innovative technologies which allow participants to have more confidence in
decision-making processes by structuring how arguments are presented and vetted, and by openly showing changes which occur over time to neutral, supporting, and opposing arguments.  All overarching assertions are considered by definition to be neutral
arguments, because they are not sub-assertions below other assertions.  Another example of a neutral argument would be a restatement of an overarching assertion or sub-assertion, placed as a sub-assertion below the assertion it is restating.  Such a
restatement might be done, for instance, to suggest a more clear way of stating the assertion.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> It is an object of the present invention to provide a technology which assists individuals to better understand their own positions, explain them to others, and for group or organization decision makers to better understand participants'
preferences and reasons for those preferences.  It is a further object of the present invention to provide a debate and decision-making framework which allows participants to have more confidence in decision-making processes by structuring how arguments
are presented and vetted, and by openly showing changes to context and neutral, supporting, and opposing arguments.
<br/><br/> The present invention provides a framework for assisting individuals in decision making and managing decision making for groups and organizations.  In one aspect, the present invention aggregates neutral and informational statements as well as
supporting and opposing arguments relating to an assertion into an electronic archive accessible through a network, such that all submitted arguments may be reviewed by the public or appropriate members of the group or organization.  In a preferred
embodiment, one aspect of the present invention allows those reading an argument (assertion) to rate it for clarity.  In a preferred embodiment, once an assertion has been sufficiently rated as clear, users may rate the assertion on an
agreement/disagreement scale and on a scale of how relevant/irrelevant they perceive the assertion to be to an overarching topic or assertion, and users may add neutral, supporting or opposing arguments.  Within this document, the terms "argument" and
"assertion" are used interchangeably.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, arguments are by default sorted to visually help participants prioritize and more accurately rate each argument relative to others.  One aspect of the present invention allows participants to enter a reason for each
rating they make, so they can be easily reminded of their thinking later, and so people can make their reasoning visible to others.  In one embodiment, users may check a checkbox to keep their reasons private if they prefer, or may elect to make their
reasoning visible to group decision makers but not visible to other participants.  Since group decision makers benefit from knowing participants' reasoning, one aspect of the present invention allows for the requirement that participants include the
reason (which will be visible to group decision makers) for their chosen ratings for each argument.
<br/><br/> After participants have rated an assertion using the present invention, a project manager or group decision maker can see the relative preferences of participants as a whole and individually, but most importantly, can also understand why
participants chose the ratings values they did.  By collecting information from all participants, decision makers can learn whether particular participants have information that may not be commonly known to the rest of the group.  Decision makers can
also learn which participants may have misinformation.  Such knowledge facilitates better management of the decision-making process, and enables better decisions.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, each user is assigned one of seven global levels of authority, and different levels of authority grant access to different features.  Features available to a user at a given authority level include enabling or
disabling different ratings features and sub-argument creation features for those of lesser authority, and limiting access to content for those of lesser authority.  In a preferred embodiment, the authority structure of the present invention is a tree
structure.  This facilitates for example a manager at a given level having authority over system features available to his or her direct reports, but not having such authority over features available to the direct reports of another manager at the same
given level.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, users at a given level of authority over a specific topic may assign that level of authority over that topic to someone who has a lesser level of authority over that topic.  Such assigned authority is conditional on
the continued approval of the person who assigned it, and the person who assigned it may remove that assigned level of authority at any time, even if that assigned level of authority is equivalent to their own level of authority.  A preferred embodiment
also allows someone at a given level of authority to make a topic or arguments pertaining to that topic (or reasons for arguments) visible or invisible to others of lesser authority, for instance based on "need to know".  In a preferred embodiment, users

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF SOME PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> The hardware of a preferred embodiment of the present invention is depicted in FIG. 17.  A computer 1700 reads and executes instructions from a computer-readable media 1701 (such as a hard disk, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory
(ROM), CD-ROM, FLASH memory, or the like).  The instructions are executed on processor 1702.  A user of the present invention may control aspects of the invention using keyboard 1705 and/or pointing device 1704, in conjunction with display screen 1703.
<br/><br/> In a web-hosted preferred embodiment, host computer 1700 is connected to a network (such as the Internet 1706), and a remote computer 1707 with remote display 1709, remote keyboard 1708, and remote pointing device 1710 may be used to access the
features of the present invention.  Remote computer 1707 may be a smart phone, tablet, laptop PC, desktop PC, or any other computing device as may become available, and pointing device 1710 may be a mouse, track ball, touch screen, or any other pointing
device as may become available.
<br/><br/> Several aspects of the present invention take the form of a tree structure.  FIG. 14 depicts the organization of arguments (also herein referred to as assertions) within a preferred embodiment of the present invention.  The root 1400 of this
tree may be considered to be the database which contains all the data.  The next level of the tree in a preferred embodiment is a set of topics.  For instance, topic 1402 might be "the environment", and topic 1401 might be "politics".
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, the next level of the argument tree is a set of overarching assertions.  In this example, overarching assertions (arguments) 1403 and 1404 each concern the environment.  For instance, overarching assertion 1404 may be
an assertion about global warming, and overarching assertion 1403 may be about the environmental effects of mercury released into the atmosphere through the burning of coal.
<br/><br/> The next level of this tree in a preferred embodiment of the present invention is a set of sub-arguments (sub-assertions) below each overarching assertion.  A sub-assertion directly below any given assertion may herein be referred to as a child
assertion of that given assertion.  Likewise, a sub-assertion two levels below a given assertion may herein be referred to as a grandchild assertion of that given assertion.  Likewise, an assertion which has a sub-assertion directly beneath it may herein
be referred to as a parent assertion of the assertion which is directly beneath it, and an assertion one level above a parent assertion may herein be referred to as a grandparent assertion.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, some of these sub-assertions may support the overarching assertion and some may oppose the overarching assertion.  For instance, if overarching assertion 1404 is that global warming is predominantly man-made,
sub-argument 1405 may be a supporting sub-argument that shows that average atmospheric temperatures have been rising as atmospheric carbon dioxide has been rising, and opposing sub-argument 1406 might be an assertion that glacial ice records show such
rise and fall of global temperatures in the past before mankind existed.  In a preferred embodiment, each sub-assertion such as sub-assertion 1405 may become its own overarching assertion, and have supporting and opposing sub-assertions (also herein
referred to as "child" arguments) such as child arguments 1407 and 1408, that may support or oppose it.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, levels of authority within the present invention are also organized in a tree structure.  FIG. 15 depicts levels of authority in a preferred embodiment of the present invention.  The root level of authority 1500 is
originally held by the system administrator who configures the system, though in a preferred embodiment of the present invention the types of authority that such a person holds will be limited after the system is configured.  Let us suppose that the
present invention is used to facilitate decision making in a corporation, and the CEO holds the highest level of authority 1501 in that corporation.  Vice presidents in the corporation hold levels of authority 1502, 1503, and 1504 that are parallel but
distinct, in the sense that they each have people who report to them directly and indirectly over whom they have authority, but one VP does not have authority over another VP's direct and indirect subordinates.
<br/><br/> Within this document, any first person to whom a second person does not report directly or indirectly, and who does not report to that second person directly or indirectly, is said to hold a parallel level of authority.  Thus persons 1502, 1505,
1507, and 1508 all hold parallel levels of authority with respect to person 1503.  In a preferred embodiment, when a user has authority over an assertion or topic within the present invention, he or she may revocably assign that level of authority over
that topic or assertion to anyone of subordinate or parallel authority.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, any person at a given level of authority in the authority tree of FIG. 15 may control whether various features of the present invention are available to persons who report either directly or indirectly to them.  In a
preferred embodiment, such persons have subordinate levels of authority.  For example, VP2 who is at authority level 1502 may control what features of the present invention are available to persons at levels of authority 1505, 1507, 1508, and 1509
(unless overridden by the CEO who is at a higher authority level), but cannot control features of the present invention available to persons at levels of authority 1504, 1506, 1503, or 1510.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, persons of parallel authority (for instance persons at authority levels 1502 and 1503) do not have authority over topics created by each other.  In a preferred embodiment, when an overarching topic is created within
the present invention by a person at authority level 1502, that person may confer a subordinate level of authority over that topic to a person of parallel authority (for instance the person at authority level 1503).  Such a conferred subordinate
authority level is topic-specific or assertion-specific.  This aspect of the present invention enables peers to each have authority over topics and/or overarching assertions they create, and the arguments that are entered by others under those topics.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, a person at (for example) authority level 1503 may set parameters regarding topics and overarching assertions he/she creates within the system (for instance a parameter requiring others to rate an overarching assertion
for clarity prior to any sub-arguments being presented), and for persons of lesser authority such limitation is binding, while for persons of higher authority the limitation appears as a request that can be overridden.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, anyone at a given level of authority may confer that level of authority to someone who is not his superior if he so desires, and may later revoke that authority.  In a preferred embodiment, all aspects of a person's
authority may be conferred, or only some aspects may be conferred.  For instance, if a vice president at level of authority 1502 is charged with making global-warming-related recommendations to the CEO, and is utilizing the present invention within his
division of the company to derive and vet a global warming policy, but will be in the hospital for the next two weeks undergoing heart surgery, he might choose to confer his authority over only that one topic to the person at authority level 1504, while
he might choose to confer authority over another topic within the present invention to his subordinate at level of authority 1505.
<br/><br/> A preferred embodiment of the present invention allows someone at a given level of authority to make topics, overarching assertions, and any sub-arguments at levels below an overarching assertion visible or invisible to persons lower on the
authority tree.  This aspect of the present invention facilitates involving people in a project based on their "need to know".  For instance, the CEO (at level of authority 1501) may conceive a strategic decision-making project in which he wants only
eight other people in the corporation to participate.  He may set up the "need to know" tree depicted in FIG. 16, where the only people able to see the topics and arguments related to the project are two vice presidents (at levels of authority 1502 and
1504), two division heads (at levels of authority 1505 and 1506), one first-level manager (at level of authority 1507), and three non-managers (at levels of authority 1508, 1509, and 1510.  FIG. 6 depicts topics and illustrates how a person with
sufficient authority can set and change visibility permissions by clicking on button 600 or 601.
<br/><br/> Now that we have described the levels of authority within a preferred embodiment of the present invention, we will describe how the argument-vetting features of a preferred embodiment of the present invention are used.  FIG. 1 is a screen shot
depicting an aspect of the present invention which aids in vetting arguments.  Overarching assertion 100 is displayed in a banner across the top of the page, and may correspond, for example, to overarching assertion 1404 within topic 1402 in FIG. 14.
<br/><br/> Sub-assertions 106, 108, etc. are shown below overarching assertion 100 in order of user-rated relevance.  The user assigns agreement ratings 110, 111, etc. after reading sub-assertions 106, 108, etc. (and perhaps explanations/detailed
descriptions 107, 109).  In the embodiment shown, a higher agreement number indicates "more agreement", and a lower agreement rating indicates "less agreement".  In a preferred embodiment, when list 114 of sub-arguments cannot be displayed on one screen,
list 114 automatically becomes a scrolling list, and a vertical scrolling bar appears to the right of list 114.  In a preferred embodiment, list 114 takes up at least 50% of the width of the display on which the interface of FIG. 1 is displayed.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, assertions are displayed sorted such that first appear assertions that have not yet been rated, and next appear rated assertions in descending order from highest rated to lowest rated.  This naturally leads a user to
first rate all assertions, and subsequently by default to first have visible the assertions that were felt to be the most useful in evaluating an overarching assertion or sub-assertion.
<br/><br/> Button 101 selects the "Full" display mode shown in FIG. 1, where both sub-assertions 106, 108, etc., and descriptions 107, 109, etc. are displayed.  Button 102 selects a display mode (shown in FIG. 19) where only sub-assertion summaries 106,
108, etc. are displayed.  In a preferred embodiment, button 103 selects a display mode (which may be referred to as "Summary With Subs" mode, depicted in FIG. 20) where sub-assertion summaries 106, 108, etc., and summaries of sub-sub assertions 2000,
2001 below those assertions are also displayed.
<br/><br/> Mode button 104 selects the display mode shown in FIG. 1 where assertions and sub-assertions are shown.  Mode button 105 selects a display mode where context is displayed, including assertions that are similar but not part of the supporting or
opposing assertions, assumptions and questions, implied narrative to the assertion, and big picture or background information.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, more than one column of user-assigned ratings (such as ratings column 115) may be visible in the user interface depicted in FIG. 1.  For instance.  In a preferred embodiment, the different ratings columns that can be
shown in the interface of FIG. 1 include: relevance/irrelevance, agreement/disagreement, and clarity/unclarity.  In a preferred embodiment, an aspect of which is depicted in FIG. 7, a user of sufficient authority may enable, or disable or require each
type of rating separately for all persons or individual persons of lesser authority by selecting from options 700.  A user of sufficient authority may determine what is displayed to the left of the sub-assertions, such as in 110 or 111, by selecting from
701 which rating(s) or calculations of ratings are to be displayed.
<br/><br/> Requiring ratings of different types at different times may serve different purposes.  When an overarching assertion is first posted, for instance, it may be desirable to make sure the assertion appears clear and unambiguous to everyone who will
be involved in a decision-making process concerning that assertion, before debate about the assertion begins, so it may be desirable for a person of sufficient authority to require that everyone rate the clarity of the assertion (for instance on a scale
from 1 (not clear at all) to 10 (perfectly unambiguously clear)), before any agreement/disagreement ratings or supporting or opposing arguments may be posted.  For instance, if a manager posted the overarching assertion "customers who have bought product
X extremely often on Tuesday afternoons call our call center with complaints", a user might rate that assertion very unclear, because someone who 70% agrees might be agreeing totally with the "extremely often", disagreeing with the "Tuesday afternoons",
and partly agreeing with the "with complaints".  It might also be pointed out that it is unclear whether the "extremely often" refers to how often the customer has bought the product or whether it refers to how often the customer calls.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 depicts an aspect of a preferred embodiment enabling a user with sufficient authority, once an assertion has been rated by a sufficient number of participants as sufficiently clear, to open an assertion for users to post one or more
supporting and/or opposing sub-assertions before anyone is allowed to rate the overarching assertion on a scale of agreement/disagreement.  FIG. 13 depicts an aspect of a preferred embodiment which enables a user of sufficient authority to define the
number of ratings and their descriptors to users.
<br/><br/> In a preferred embodiment, a user of sufficient authority may open an interface similar to that shown in FIG. 4 to enable agreement/disagreement ratings and require a reason to be typed for each rating entered.  In a preferred embodiment, any
attribute (such as "open for ratings" attribute 400 or "require rating reasons" attribute 401) can be set automatically for the entire tree of users of subordinate or parallel authority, or an associated "tree" button (such as tree button 403 associated
with "open for ratings" parameter 400 can be clicked by the user to open up the portion of the authority tree of FIG. 15 that is below the authority of the user setting the parameter, and the user may set the parameter down to the level of individual
users if desired.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 depicts the interface of FIG. 1 with an added overlaid sub-window text box 200 that appears when the user hovers his or her graphical pointer over rating argument rating 201.  A graphical pointer in a preferred embodiment of the present
invention may be controlled by a mouse, a track ball, a tablet pen, a touch-screen, or any other pointing device as may become available.  In a preferred embodiment, rating 201 is a clickable link allowing a user to change his or her rating, and also
includes the ability to edit a typed reason for such rating.  The overlaid sub-window text box displays a text summary of why the user assigned the numerical rating he or she assigned.  In a preferred embodiment, the rating number and the reason for the
rating may both be edited within text 300 by the user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 depicts an aspect of the present invention which enables users with sufficient authority to review the history of when edits were made to an argument's summary and description, as well as which assertion it supported or opposed.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 depicts an aspect of the present invention enabling users with sufficient authority to review and compare different past versions of an argument, and read comments on changes that were made over time.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 depicts an aspect of the present invention which enables users of sufficient authority to review the history of edits made to arguments, wherein the history includes a listing of which sub-assertions historically supported and opposed an
overarching assertion or sub-assertion.  Sub-assertions that have been changed are indicated by a triangle such as 1103.  Record 1100 indicates that an opposing (indicated by red letters and a minus sign preceding it) sub-assertion was reworded from `Not
a US concern.` to `Iran having nuclear weapons is not a US concern.` The red highlighting and strikethrough shows the letter `N` that was removed and the green background and underlining shows how `Iran having nuclear weapons is n` was added.  Similarly,
record 1101 indicates the whole supporting (indicated by green letters and by a + sign) sub-assertion `Iranian bomb would upset regional power balance.` was added because it has the green background and underlined.  Record 1102 indicates the last
sub-assertion was removed because it has a red background and strikethrough.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 depicts an aspect of a preferred embodiment of the present invention enabling a user to enter two ratings for a chosen argument, and reasons for those ratings.  In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, rating window 300 appears
in response to the user clicking on rating 309.  Within rating window 300, the user may select an agreement/disagreement rating number from a menu accessible through agreement rating menu button 307, and may select a relevance rating from relevance
rating menu 308.  The user may also type in a reason 304 for his or her chosen agreement rating, and a reason 303 for his or her chosen relevance rating.  The user may also hide the reasons for the ratings from other users by checking checkbox 310.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 depicts an aspect of the graphical user interface of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, where someone with appropriate authority can choose whether a topic is visible to users or hidden.  Topics may, for example, be hidden
early in development.  Check box 500 may be checked to make the topic invisible to all users of subordinate authority, or "need to know" tree button 501 may be clicked to open a window which allows the user to select which users of subordinate authority
will be able to see the topic and which will not.
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 depicts an aspect of a preferred embodiment of the present invention where two ratings, for example one for Agreement and the other for Relevance, are combined using a mathematical formula.  In a preferred embodiment of the present
invention, Agreement rating 1801 is multiplied by Relevance rating 1800 to generate the `My Rating` 1802 associated with that sub-assertion.
<br/><br/> Within this document, the term "hover-over event" describes a condition where a user has positioned a graphical pointer within a defined space for longer than some pre-determined amount of time.  Such an event may indicate curiosity about a
graphical construct over which the user has hovered the graphical pointer.  Such events are commonly detected in HTML2 web interfaces, and used to pop-up information boxes or dialog boxes.
<br/><br/> The foregoing discussion should be understood as illustrative and should not be considered to be limiting in any sense.  While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be
understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims.
