<br/><br/>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<br/><br/> Provided are compositions and methods for preparing foods and beverages that contain additives, such as nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals and supplements.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Non-polar compounds are not easily dissolved in aqueous solutions, such as water or other polar solvents.  A number of non-polar compounds are used in compositions for human ingestion, for example, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and/or dietary
supplements.  Exemplary non-polar compounds used in such compositions are vitamins and minerals, fatty acids, and other non-polar compounds, non-polar active agents, and non-polar active ingredients.
<br/><br/> Because of poor water solubility, inclusion of non-polar compounds in products for human consumption, for example, supplements, foods and beverages, often is challenging.  Available compositions containing non-polar compounds, particularly
aqueous compositions containing non-polar compounds, and methods for formulating such compositions, are limited.  Thus, there remains a need to develop compositions containing non-polar compounds and methods for making the compositions.  Accordingly, it
is among the objects herein to provide compositions, including aqueous compositions, containing non-polar compounds, and methods for making the compositions.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Provided are first compositions (concentrates) that contain non-polar compounds, including liquid nanoemulsion concentrates.  Also provided are methods that use such first compositions to prepare other compositions, such as beverages and other
aqueous liquids, into which the first compositions are diluted to form liquid dilution compositions.  Also provided are liquid dilution compositions containing the beverage or other aqueous liquid and the diluted concentrate.  The concentrates contain
dispersions, and/or can be used to prepare dispersions, of effective amounts of additives, such as non-polar compounds, including non-polar active ingredients, such as nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and supplements, such as essential fatty acids,
including polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, conjugated fatty acids, and other fatty acids; phytochemicals, including phytosterols; other oils; coenzymes, including Coenzyme Q10; vitamins, including vitamin D3;
and other oil-based additives.  The amounts in the resulting diluted compositions are effective to supplement the diet.  The compositions provided herein are stable dispersions without phase separation or other changes.
<br/><br/> For example, the provided compositions include concentrates containing non-polar active ingredients, surfactants, and polar solvents, at amounts whereby dilution of the concentrate in an aqueous medium, such as a beverage, at a particular amount
(e.g., any of the specified amounts, concentrations, and dilutions of the concentrates and any of the amounts of the non-polar active ingredients described herein below), yields a liquid dilution composition containing effective amounts of the non-polar
active ingredient and having one or more desired properties.  The provided compositions further include liquid dilution compositions, including the liquid dilution compositions made from the concentrates, containing aqueous media, non-polar active
ingredients at effective amounts and polar solvents that have the desired properties.  The amount of the concentrate and/or amount of the non-polar active ingredient can be specified.  The desired properties include clarity of the liquid dilution
compositions, such as compositions that are clear or about as clear as the aqueous medium in the absence of the concentrate and/or in the absence of the non-polar active ingredient; particle size, such as particle size of less than 200 nm or less than
about 200 nm, less than 100 nm or less than about 100 nm, less than 50 nm or less than about 50 nm, or less than 25 nm or less than about 25 nm, at most or on average; turbidity, such as a Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) value of less than 200 or
about 200, less than 100 or about 100, less than 50 or about 50, less than 30 or about 30, less than 25 or about 25, or less than 10 or about 10; and the lack of visible particles, visible crystals, phase separation, and/or ringing.
<br/><br/> The provided concentrates typically are liquid nanoemulsion concentrates, which contain surfactants (typically a surfactant that is a sugar fatty acid ester or mixture of sugar fatty acids esters, such as, for example a sucrose fatty acid ester
or a mixture of sucrose fatty acids esters or a mixture of the sucrose fatty acid esters and a PEG-derivative of Vitamin E), non-polar compound(s) (which typically is/are a non-polar active ingredient which differs from the surfactant) and a polar
solvent (e.g., water or other edible aqueous liquid, such as a polar protic solvent such as a dihydric or trihydric alcohol, e.g., propylene glycol and glycerin (glycerol)).
<br/><br/> The amount of non-polar compound in the concentrate typically is between 5% or about 5% and 10% or about 10%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate, e.g., at or about 5, 5.2, 5.25, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10%, by weight, of the concentrate.
<br/><br/> The surfactants in the provided concentrates typically have a Hydrophilic Lipophilic Balance (HLB) value of between 14 or about 14 and 20 or about 20, such as between 15 or about 15 and 18 or about 18, e.g., at or about 15, 16, 17, or 18. 
Exemplary surfactants for use in the compositions provided include non-ionic surfactants, such as sugar ester surfactants, such as sugar fatty acid ester surfactants, typically, sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants, which typically contain sucrose fatty
acid monoesters (e.g., sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants).
<br/><br/> The amount of surfactant(s) in the concentrate typically is between 16% or about 16% and 30% or about 30%, by weight, of the concentrate, e.g., at or about 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30%, by weight (w/w), of the
concentrate.  When the concentrate contains a mixture of sucrose fatty acid esters and a PEG-derivative of Vitamin E as surfactants, the compositions typically contain at least 1% or at least about 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% or 10% sucrose fatty
esters.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the amount of the surfactant(s) in the concentrate is between 17% or about 17% and 26% or about 26%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate, for example, between 18% or about 18% and 26% or about 26%, or between 16% or about 16%
and 18% or about 18%.  In some examples, the amount of the surfactant(s) in the concentrate is at or about 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, or 26%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate, such as, for example, 17.75%, 20.25%, 20.5%, 22.7%, or 25.2%
(w/w) of the concentrate.
<br/><br/> The amount of polar solvent in the concentrate typically is between 60% or about 60% and 79% or about 79%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate, for example, at or about 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78,
or 79%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate.
<br/><br/> In one example, the amount of polar solvent in the concentrate is between 65% or about 65% and 79% or about 79%, between 65% or about 65% and 75% or about 75%, between 65% or about 65% and 76% or about 76%, between 68% or about 68% and 76% or
about 76%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate.  For example, the amount of polar solvent in the concentrate can be at or about 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, or 80%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate, such as at or about
74.25%, at or about 75.8%, at or about 68.9%, at or about 71.74%, at or about 63.94%, at or about 68.79%, at or about 68.29%, at or about 69.02%, or at or about 71.49%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate.
<br/><br/> Among the sugar ester surfactants are sugar fatty acid ester surfactants, typically sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants.  The sugar fatty acid ester surfactants can be blends of different esters, such as sugar fatty acid monoesters, diesters,
triesters, and polyesters.  The sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants typically contain sucrose fatty acid monoesters.  The sucrose fatty acid esters containing monoesters further can contain one or more of sucrose fatty acid diesters, triesters, and/or
polyesters.  In one example, the sucrose fatty acid ester contains one or more of sucrose stearate, sucrose laurate, sucrose palmitate, sucrose oleate, sucrose caprylate, sucrose decanoate, sucrose myristate, sucrose pelargonate, sucrose undecanoate,
sucrose tridecanoate, sucrose pentadeconoate, sucrose heptadecanoate, and homologs thereof, including mono-, di-, tri-, and poly-ester forms of these sucrose fatty acid esters.
<br/><br/> The sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants include surfactants that are blends of sucrose fatty acid esters, containing a plurality of different sucrose fatty acid esters.  The different sucrose fatty acid esters in the blend can vary in the
length and/or saturation of the carbon chain of the fatty acid portion of the ester, or in the degree of esterification (e.g., whether the ester is a monoester, diester, triester, or polyester).  Typically, the sucrose fatty acid ester surfactant

dilution composition, yields a liquid dilution composition having a Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) value of less than 200 or about 200, less than 100 or about 100, less than 50 or about 50, less than 30 or about 30, less than 25 or about 25, or less
than 10 or about 10, or yields a liquid dilution composition that is at least as clear or at least about as clear as, the aqueous medium in the absence of the concentrate (i.e., compared to the clarity of the aqueous medium prior to addition of the
concentrate).
<br/><br/> In another example, the concentrate is formulated such that, upon dilution, it yields a stable liquid dilution composition, for example a composition that does not contain visible particles, does not contain visible crystals, does not exhibit
ringing, or a combination thereof.  The stability can be for a specified period of time, and/or when the concentrate or liquid dilution composition is kept at a particular temperature.  For example, the concentrate can be formulated such that dilution of
at least 0.5 g or about 0.5 g, at least 1 g or about 1 g, at least 2 g or about 2 g, at least 5 g or about 5 g, or at least 10 g or about 10 g of the concentrate into 8 fluid ounces (0.236588 liters), or about 8 fluid ounces, of an aqueous medium;
dilution of the concentrate in an aqueous medium, at a dilution of not more than 1:10 or about 1:10, not more than 1:25 or about 1:25, not more than 1:50 or about 1:50, not more than 1:100 or about 1:100, not more than 1:250 or about 1:250, or, at most,
not more than 1:500 or about 1:500; and/or dilution of the concentrate into an aqueous medium to form a liquid dilution composition containing at least 25 mg or about 25 mg, at least 35 mg or about 35 mg, at least 50 mg or about 50 mg, at least 100 mg or
about 100 mg, at least 250 mg or about 250 mg, or at least 500 mg or about 500 mg of the non-polar active ingredient per 8 fluid ounces of the liquid dilution composition, yields a liquid dilution composition that does not contain visible particles, does
not contain visible crystals, does not exhibit phase separation, and/or does not exhibit ringing, and/or is pleasant tasting and/or smelling.  The concentrate can be formulated such that the liquid dilution composition remains free from visible
particles, remains free from visible crystals, remains free from phase separation, remains free from ringing and/or is pleasant tasting and smelling, when the concentrate and/or the liquid dilution composition is stored at room temperature, or at a
refrigerated temperature, or at a frozen temperature.  The storage can be, for example, for at least one day, at least one week, at least thirty days, or at least one year.
<br/><br/> The aqueous medium can be a beverage, such as, for example, water, juice, soda, tea, coffee, sports drinks, nutritional beverages, energy drinks, milk, and other beverages, including those described herein.
<br/><br/> Also provided are the liquid dilution compositions, which contain the concentrates diluted in an aqueous medium, e.g., a beverage.  The liquid dilution compositions can contain any of the provided concentrates.  Thus, the liquid dilution
compositions contain the non-polar active ingredients in aqueous medium, such as beverages, that are desirable for human consumption.  The liquid dilution compositions include those made by diluting the concentrates, such as those having the properties
as described above, such as the desired particle size, clarity, NTU value and/or stability, for example, lack of ringing, visible crystals, phase separation, and/or pleasant taste/smell, for example, according to the specifications described above.
<br/><br/> In one example, the aqueous medium contained in the liquid dilution composition is a beverage, such as, for example, water, soda, milk, tea, coffee, juice, energy drink or a sports or nutrition beverage.  In one aspect, the liquid dilution
composition is as clear or about as clear as the aqueous medium, such as the beverage, prior to addition of the concentrate (e.g., compared to the absence of the concentrate), and/or remains as clear or about as clear as the beverage when stored at room
temperature (e.g., 25.degree.  C. or about 25.degree.  C.), or at a refrigerated temperature (e.g., 0-10.degree.  C. or about 0-10.degree.  C., e.g., at or about 4.degree.  C.), or at a frozen temperature (e.g., -20.degree.  C. or about -20.degree.  C.),
wherein the storage is for at least one day, at least one week, at least thirty days, or at least one year.
<br/><br/> The amount of the concentrate in the liquid dilution composition can be specified.  For example, the liquid dilution compositions include those containing at least 0.5 grams (g) or about 0.5 g, at least 1 g or about 1 g, at least 2 g or about 2
g, at least 5 g or about 5 g, or at least 10 g or about 10 g of the concentrate, per 8 fluid ounces (0.236588 liters) of the aqueous medium; or containing the concentrate at a dilution of not more than 1:10 or about 1:10, not more than 1:25 or about
1:25, not more than 1:50 or about 1:50, not more than 1:100 or about 1:100, not more than 1:250 or about 1:250 or, at most, not more than 1:500 or about 1:500; or containing at least 25 mg or about 25 mg, at least 35 mg or about 35 mg, at least 50 mg or
about 50 mg, at least 100 mg or about 100 mg, at least 250 mg or about 250 mg, or at least 500 mg or about 500 mg of the non-polar active ingredient per 8 fluid ounces of the aqueous medium.  The liquid dilution compositions typically have one or more
desired property, such as particle size, clarity, NTU value, stability, e.g., free from crystals, phase separation, ringing or unpleasant taste/smell, such as for at least a specified amount of time when stored under specified storage conditions.
<br/><br/> For example, the compositions include liquid dilution compositions having a particle size less than 500 or about 500, less than 300 or about 300, less than 200 or about 200 nm, less than 100 or about 100 nm, less than 50 or about 50 nm or less
than 25 or about 25 nm on the average or at the most; those having an NTU value less than 500 or about 500, less than 300 or about 300, less than 200 or about 200, less than 100 or about 100, less than 50 or about 50, less than 25 or about 25, or less
than 10 or about 10; those containing visible particles, does not contain visible crystals, not exhibiting ringing and/or phase separation; and/or remaining free from (or does not exhibit) visible particles, visible crystals, ringing and/or phase
separation, and/or unpleasant taste/smell when stored at room temperature (e.g., 25.degree.  C. or about 25.degree.  C.), or at a refrigerated temperature (e.g., 0-10.degree.  C. or about 0-10.degree.  C., e.g., at or about 4.degree.  C.), or at a frozen
temperature (e.g., -20.degree.  C. or about -20.degree.  C.), when the storage is for at least one day, at least one week, at least thirty days, or at least one year.
<br/><br/> Also provided are methods for making the concentrates and methods for making the liquid dilution compositions.  Generally, the methods for making the concentrates are carried out by generating, separately, an oil phase and a water phase, and
mixing the two phases, typically by emulsification, to form the concentrate, which is a liquid nanoemulsion concentrate.  Oil phase ingredients are added to form the oil phase and water phase ingredients are added to form the water phase.  The
ingredients are selected from ingredients of the concentrates, as described herein, which typically include a non-polar compound, a surfactant and a polar solvent, as described herein.  Typically, the oil phase ingredients include the non-polar
compound(s), typically a non-polar active ingredient(s), of the concentrate, and the water phase ingredients include the polar solvent.  The ingredients are added at amounts within the appropriate concentration range for the provided concentrates as
described herein.  In one example, the water phase ingredients include the surfactant.  In another example, the oil phase ingredients contain the surfactant.  In one example, the water phase ingredients and the oil phase ingredients contain the
surfactant.
<br/><br/> The amounts of the surfactant(s), non-polar active ingredient(s) and polar solvent are selected based on the appropriate concentration ranges of these ingredients in the resulting concentrate.  For example, the non-polar active ingredient is
included at an amount that is between 5% or about 5% and 10% or about 10%, by weight (w/w), of the final concentrate; the surfactant is included at an amount that is between 16% or about 16% and 30% or about 30%, by weight (w/w), of the final
concentrate; and the polar solvent is included at an amount that is between 60% or about 60% and 79% or about 79%, by weight (w/w), of the final concentrate, as described above.
<br/><br/> In one example, the oil phase ingredients further include the non-polar solvent(s).  In one example, the concentrate is made with first and second oil phase ingredients and the first oil phase ingredients include the non-polar active ingredient
and the solvent.  In one example, the solvent contains an oil, other than the non-polar active ingredient, such as, for example, Vitamin E, flaxseed oil and/or safflower oil.
<br/><br/> In one example, the oil phase ingredients and/or the water phase ingredients contain the co-surfactant, at an amount sufficient to stabilize the concentrate, such as a phospholipid, e.g., phosphatidylcholine.  In one example, the amount of
phospholipid is between 0.1% or about 0.1% and 1% or about 1%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate.  In another example, the oil phase ingredients and/or the water phase ingredients further contain the at least one preservative in amount sufficient to
preserve the concentrate, such as, for example, a preservative containing benzyl alcohol.  In one example, the amount of preservative and/or the benzyl alcohol is between 0.1% or about 0.1% and 1% or about 1%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate.
<br/><br/> In another example, the oil phase ingredients and/or the water phase ingredients further contain an emulsion stabilizer, at an amount sufficient to stabilize the concentrate, such as an emulsion stabilizer containing a blend of gums, such as any
one or more of guar gum, xanthan gum and sodium alginate.
<br/><br/> In an exemplary provided method for making the concentrate, an oil phase is generated by mixing the oil phase ingredients in a first vessel and heating the oil phase ingredients; a water phase is generated by mixing one or more water phase
ingredients in a second vessel and heating the water phase ingredients; and the oil and water phases are emulsified to generate the concentrate.
<br/><br/> In another exemplary provided method, an oil phase is generated by mixing one or more first oil phase ingredients in a first vessel and heating the first oil phase ingredients at least until the first oil phase ingredients dissolve; then adding
one or more additional oil phase ingredients to the first vessel; and mixing and heating the first and the additional oil phase ingredients; a water phase is generated by mixing one or more water phase ingredients in a second vessel and heating the water
phase ingredient(s); and the water and oil phases are emulsified, to generate the concentrate.
<br/><br/> The heating and mixing of the water and oil phases can be carried out simultaneously or sequentially, in any order.
<br/><br/> In any of the provided methods for making the concentrates, the mixing steps (e.g., mixing the oil and/or water phases) can be carried out with a standard mixer, such as any of the standard mixers listed herein, or with any of the other mixers
described herein, such as with a homogenizer.  In any of the provided methods, the heating can be carried out using one or more heating apparatuses, such as, for example, a hot plate, a water jacket, or any of the heating apparatuses listed herein.  In
one example, the oil phase ingredients are heated with a first heating apparatus and the water phase ingredients are heated with a second heating apparatus.  In one example, heating involves heating the ingredients to 60.degree.  C. or about 60.degree. 
C., or to at or about 70.degree.  C. or at or about 71.degree.  C. In one example, the oil phase and/or water phase ingredients are heated to between about between 45.degree.  C. or about 45.degree.  C. and 85.degree.  C. or about 85.degree.  C., for
example, at or about 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84 or 85.degree.  C.
<br/><br/> In any of the provided methods, the emulsifying can be carried out using a homogenizer, such as any homogenizer described herein.  In one example, the emulsifying is performed at between 850 rpm or about 850 rpm and 1200 rpm or about 1200 rpm. 
In another example, the emulsifying is performed at a speed lower then 850 rpm, such as, for example, between 25 or about 25 rpm and 50 rpm or about 50 rpm, for example at or about 30 rpm.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the methods further include rapidly cooling the forming emulsion during the emulsifying step.  In some examples, rapid cooling results in cooling of the forming emulsion to between 25.degree.  C. or about 25.degree.  C. and
43.degree.  C. or about 43.degree.  C., such as 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 or 43.degree.  C., e.g., between at or about 25.degree.  C. and at or about 35.degree.  C., or between at or about 35.degree.  C. and
at or about 43.degree.  C. In one example, the cooling of the emulsion results in less than at or about 60 minutes, in less than at or about 30 minutes, or between at or about 30 and at or about 60 minutes.  Exemplary of the means for performing the
rapid cooling include repeatedly passing the phases through a cooling apparatus attached to a vessel.
<br/><br/> The provided methods further can include adding one or more flavors (e.g., lemon oil, D-limonene) and/or one or more pH adjusters (e.g., citric acid, phosphoric acid) to the concentrate, for example, after emulsifying the oil and water phases. 
The pH typically is measured simultaneously with, before and/or after addition of the pH adjuster, and the amount of pH adjuster is determined by the pH of the concentrate.  Typically, the pH adjuster comprises an acid or a base at an amount sufficient
to affect the pH of the concentrate.
<br/><br/> In one example of the methods, the ingredients are added to the vessel(s) simultaneously or sequentially, in any order.  In another example, the ingredients (e.g., the oil phase and/or water phase ingredients) are added to the vessels in a
particular order, such as a specific order provided herein, for example, in the individual examples provided.  In one example, where the water phase ingredients contain a polar solvent (e.g., water, propylene glycol, glycerin or other diol such as
another sugar alcohol) and an emulsion stabilizer, the water phase ingredients are added sequentially, in the following order: 1) polar solvent (e.g., water, propylene glycol or glycerin); 2) emulsion stabilizer.  In another example, where the oil phase
ingredients contain the surfactant, the non-polar compound and a preservative, the oil phase ingredients are added sequentially, in the following order: 1) surfactant, 2) preservative; 3) non-polar compound (i.e., non-polar active ingredient).  In
another example, where the oil phase ingredients contain the surfactant, the non-polar compound, a preservative and an emulsion stabilizer, the oil phase ingredients are added to the oil phase vessel sequentially, in the following order: 1) surfactant;
2) preservative; 3) non-polar compound; and 4) emulsion stabilizer.  In another example, where the oil phase ingredients contain the surfactant, the non-polar compound, a preservative, a solvent and an emulsion stabilizer, the oil phase ingredients are
added to the oil phase vessel sequentially, in the following order: 1) surfactant; 2) preservative; 3) non-polar solvent; 4) non-polar compound; and 5) emulsion stabilizer.  In another example, where the oil phase ingredients contain the surfactant, the
non-polar compound, a preservative, a non-polar solvent, a co-surfactant and an emulsion stabilizer, the oil phase ingredients are added to the oil phase vessel sequentially, in the following order: 1) surfactant; 2) preservative; 3) non-polar solvent;
4) co-surfactant; 5) non-polar compound; and 6) emulsion stabilizer.  In another example, where the water phase contains a polar solvent and a surfactant, the polar solvent and the surfactant are added sequentially, in that order.  In another example,
where the oil phase contains a non-polar solvent, a preservative, a co-surfactant, a surfactant and a non-polar compound, the non-polar solvent, the preservative and the co-surfactant are added and mixed until the co-surfactant dissolves; the surfactant
is added until dissolved; and the non-polar active ingredient is added, in that order.
<br/><br/> In one example, the methods for producing the concentrates are performed using bench-top process, as provided herein.  In another example, particularly when large batches of the concentrates, the methods are performed with a scaled-up process,
as described herein below, such as the exemplary scaled-up process illustrated in FIG. 1.
<br/><br/> In one example, where the polar solvent is water, the water is first purified by passage through purifiers.  In one example, the water purification is carried out by passage through purifiers, sequentially, in the following order: a carbon
filter, ion exchange equipment, reverse osmosis equipment, a 100 micron end-point filter, and a 50 micron point-of-use filter.  In this example, after purification, the water is added, with the other water phase ingredients, to a water phase tank.  The
water phase ingredient(s) then are mixed using a standard mixer attached to the tank, for example, mounted on the top of the tank.  A heating apparatus (typically the water jacket on the water phase tank) is used to heat the water phase ingredients
during water phase generation, typically to low heat (e.g., 60.degree.  C.).  To generate the oil phase, the oil phase ingredient(s) are weighed/measured and added to an oil phase tank.  The oil phase ingredients are mixed using a standard mixer attached
to the oil phase tank, for example, mounted on the tank.  A heating apparatus (typically the water jacket on the oil phase tank) is used to heat the oil phase ingredients during water phase generation, typically to low heat (e.g., 60.degree.  C.).  Once
the oil and water phases reach 60.degree.  C., and after oil phase components have dissolved, the oil and water phases are combined by transferring the oil phase to the water phase vessel, via transfer means.  For this process, a homogenizer mounted on
the water phase tank, is turned on, for example, at 850-1200 rpm.  The ball valves then are opened and the transfer pump turned on, thereby effecting transfer of the oil phase liquid to the water phase tank via the transfer hose(s).  As the phases are
combined, the mixture is homogenized by continued mixing with the homogenizer.  The homogenizer can be adjusted, for example, by adjusting the baffle plate on the homogenizer to achieve and maintain an emulsion, for example, by moving the baffle plate
further into the forming emulsion and/or further out of the forming emulsion.  During the emulsifying step, the forming emulsion is cooled, typically rapidly cooled, by repeatedly passing the forming emulsion through a recirculating cooler, which is
attached to the water phase tank.  The emulsion is transferred, via transfer means to a holding/packaging tank, where additional ingredients can be added and/or the mixture can be evaluated.  The additional ingredients are mixed into the concentrate
using a standard mixer.  An end-product filter is used to filter the concentrate before use.
<br/><br/> Any of the provided methods for producing the concentrates can be used to make any of the provided concentrates, as described herein.
<br/><br/> Also provided are methods for producing the provided liquid dilution compositions containing the concentrates, such as beverages containing the concentrates.  These methods include methods for providing oil-based additives, for example, in a
food or beverage.  These methods include adding any of the provided concentrates, e.g., liquid nanoemulsion concentrates, to an aqueous medium, such as a beverage.  Typically, the concentrate is added to the medium, e.g., beverage, such that the medium
contains an effective amount of the additive (e.g., the non-polar active ingredient).
<br/><br/> The effective amount of the additive, such as the non-polar active ingredient is the quantity and/or concentration of the additive necessary for preventing, curing, ameliorating, arresting or partially arresting a symptom of a disease or
disorder, or the quantity and/or concentration desired by an individual for intake, such as daily intake, and/or nutritional supplementation, for example, an amount sufficient to enhance the nutritional, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, health or energy
property of a food, beverage, or other consumable.  In some examples, the concentrate is added to the aqueous medium such that the resulting liquid dilution composition contains an effective amount of a particular non-polar compound, for example, a
particular amount per volume or weight of the composition, such as, for example, at least 25 mg or about 25 mg, at least 35 mg or about 35 mg, at least 50 mg or about 50 mg, at least 100 mg or about 100 mg, at least 250 mg or about 250 mg, or at least
500 mg or about 500 mg of the non-polar active ingredient per 8 fluid ounces of the liquid dilution composition.
<br/><br/> In one example, an effective amount is a concentration or amount of the liquid nanoemulsion where at least 25 mg or about 25 mg, typically at least 35 mg, for example, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140,
150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, 475, 500, 550, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1500, 2000 mg, or more, of the non-polar active ingredient, is contained in at least 8 fluid ounces of
the aqueous medium.
<br/><br/> U.S.  Provisional Application Ser.  No. 61/070,381, filed Mar.  20, 2008, entitled "COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING NON-POLAR COMPOUNDS;" and U.S.  Provisional Application Ser.  No. 61/132,424, filed Jun.  16, 2008, entitled "COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING
NON-POLAR COMPOUNDS," each to Philip Bromley, for example, provide compositions containing non-polar compounds and surfactants such as PEG-derivatives of Vitamin E, such as Tocopherol Polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS).  Any of the compositions
disclosed in the above-noted applications can be adapted to make the provided compositions, for example, by replacing all or some of the PEG-derivatives of Vitamin E in the compositions with another surfactant(s), such as sugar esters, e.g., sucrose
fatty acid esters, and other surfactants having similar HLB values, to make the provided compositions.
<br/><br/> The nanoemulsion concentrates are used to provide, by dilution, non-polar active ingredients to a beverage, such that a typical serving (i.e. between 4-10 ounces, for example, between 6-10 ounces, particularly about or 8 ounces) delivers a
single dosage of such ingredient.  The active ingredients of interest include, but are not limited to, Omega-6 (CLA), Omega-3 (DHA/EPA), Vitamin D3, CoQ10 and Phytosterols.  Typical single dosages of each can vary, but include for example: Omega-6 (CLA)
1.5-3.0 grams per serving per day in, for example, an 8 ounce beverage; Omega-3 DHA/EPA (DHA) 30-250 mg, such as 32 or 50 mg, 100, 150, 200, 220 mg, Vitamin D3 200-1200 IU, 300-1000 IU, 400-800 IU, such as 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1200, 1500,
2000 IU; CoQ10, 10-250 mg, 50-100 mg, 50-150 mg, 100-200 mg, such as 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 50-100 mg, 100-250 mg; and Phytosterols 100-1000 mg, such 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 up to 1,000 mg per. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 sets forth an exemplary scaled-up process 100 of the provided methods for making the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates.  This process is exemplary and variations can be used.  In this example, water 101 is used as the polar solvent and the
water first is purified by passage through the following purifiers, sequentially, in the following order: a carbon filter 105, ion exchange equipment 106, reverse osmosis equipment 107, a 100 micron end-point filter 108, and a 50 micron point-of-use
filter 109.  After purification, the water is added, with the other water phase ingredients, to a water phase tank 103.  In other examples, the polar solvent is another polar solvent, such as glycerin or propylene glycol.  In the illustrated example, the
water phase ingredient(s) then are mixed using a standard mixer 111 attached to the tank, for example, mounted on the top of the tank.  A heating apparatus (typically the water jacket on the water phase tank) is used to heat the water phase ingredients
during water phase generation, typically to low heat (e.g., 60.degree.  C.).  To generate the oil phase, the oil phase ingredient(s) are weighed/measured and added to an oil phase tank 102.  The oil phase ingredients are mixed using a standard mixer 111
attached to the oil phase tank, for example, mounted on the tank.  A heating apparatus (typically the water jacket on the oil phase tank) is used to heat the oil phase ingredients during water phase generation, typically to low heat (e.g., 60.degree. 
C.).  Once the oil and water phases reach 60.degree.  C., and after oil phase components have dissolved, the oil and water phases are combined by transferring the oil phase to the water phase vessel, via transfer means 112.  For this process, a
homogenizer 110 mounted on the water phase tank, is turned on, for example, at 850-1200 rpm.  The ball valves then are opened and the transfer pump turned on, thereby effecting transfer of the oil phase liquid to the water phase tank via the transfer
hose(s).  As the phases are combined, the mixture is homogenized by continued mixing with the homogenizer 110.  The homogenizer can be adjusted, for example, by adjusting the baffle plate on the homogenizer to achieve and maintain an emulsion, for
example, by moving the baffle plate further into the forming emulsion and/or further out of the forming emulsion.  During the emulsifying step, the forming emulsion is cooled, typically rapidly cooled, by repeatedly passing the forming emulsion through a
recirculating cooler 115 (e.g., Model No. OC-1000 RO, sold by Turmoil, West Swanzey, N.H.), which is attached to the water phase tank.  The emulsion is transferred, via transfer means 112 to a holding/packaging tank 104, where additional ingredients can
be added and/or the mixture can be evaluated.  The additional ingredients are mixed into the concentrate using a standard mixer 111.  An end-product filter 113 is used to filter the concentrate before use.

<br/><br/> A. Definitions
<br/><br/> Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which the invention(s) belong.  All patents, patent applications, published applications and
publications, GENBANK sequences, websites and other published materials referred to throughout the entire disclosure herein, unless noted otherwise, are incorporated by reference in their entirety.  In the event that there is a plurality of definitions
for terms herein, those in this section prevail.  Where reference is made to a URL or other such identifier or address, it is understood that such identifiers can change and particular information on the internet can come and go, but equivalent
information is known and can be readily accessed, such as by searching the internet and/or appropriate databases.  Reference thereto evidences the availability and public dissemination of such information.
<br/><br/> As used herein, colloid refers to a mixture containing two phases, a dispersed phase and a continuous phase, the dispersed phase containing particles (droplets) distributed throughout the continuous phase.  Colloidal mixtures include aerosols,
foams and dispersions, for example, emulsions, for example, nanoemulsions.  A liquid colloid, for example, a nanoemulsion, can have a similar appearance, for example, clarity, to a solution, in which there is no dispersed phase.
<br/><br/> As used herein, emulsion refers to a colloidal dispersion of two immiscible liquids, for example, an oil and water (or other aqueous liquid, e.g., a polar solvent), one of which is part of a continuous phase and the other of which is part of a
dispersed phase.  The provided compositions include emulsions, typically oil-in-water nanoemulsions (which include any oil soluble phase dispersed in any aqueous phase, also called the water phase), in which the oil phase is the dispersed phase and the
water phase is the continuous phase.  Emulsions typically are stabilized by one or more surfactants and/or co-surfactants and/or emulsion stabilizers.  Surfactants form an interfacial film between the oil and water phase of the emulsion, providing
stability.  Typically, the nanoemulsions of the provided compositions contain micelles, containing one or more surfactant surrounding a non-polar active ingredient, which are dispersed in the water phase.  Exemplary of the provided emulsions are the
provided liquid nanoemulsion concentrates and liquid dilution compositions made by diluting the concentrates, typically in an aqueous medium.
<br/><br/> As used herein, a nanoemulsion is an emulsion in which the dispersed droplets, for example, the micelles, have a diameter (particle size) less than 1000 nm or less than about 1000 nm, typically, less than 500 nm or less than about 500 nm,
typically less than 300 nm or about 300 nm, for example, less than 250 nm or about 250 nm, for example, less than 200 nm or less than about 200 nm, for example, less than or less than about 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or 200 nm.  Exemplary of nanoemulsions are the provided liquid nanoemulsion
concentrates and the liquid dilution compositions, for example, the aqueous liquid dilution compositions containing the diluted concentrates.
<br/><br/> As used herein, "surfactant" and "surface active agent" refer synonymously to synthetic and naturally occurring amphiphilic molecules that have hydrophobic portion(s) and hydrophilic portion(s).  Due to their amphiphilic (amphipathic) nature,
surfactants and co-surfactants typically can reduce the surface tension between two immiscible liquids, for example, the oil and water phases in an emulsion, stabilizing the emulsion.  Different surfactants can be characterized based on their relative
hydrophobicity and/or hydrophilicity.  For example, relatively lipophilic surfactants are more soluble in fats, oils and waxes, typically having HLB values less than 10 or about 10, while relatively hydrophilic surfactants are more soluble in aqueous
compositions, for example, water, and typically have HLB values greater than 10 or about 10.  Relatively amphiphilic surfactants are soluble in oil and water based liquids and typically have HLB values close to 10 or about 10.
<br/><br/> Surfactants include, for example, soaps, detergents, lipids, emulsifiers, dispersing agents and wetting agents, molecules that emulsify liquids, for example, by forming an emulsion in an aqueous medium or aqueous liquid dilution composition, for
example, forming a colloidal dispersion of two immiscible liquids in the form of droplets, for example, an emulsion such as a microemulsion; and compounds that form various macromolecular structures, for example, aggregates, in liquids, for example,
micelles, lipid bilayer structures, including liposomes, and inverse micelles.
<br/><br/> Typically, the surfactants used in the provided compositions have an HLB value between 14 or about 14 and 20 or about 20, for example, at or about 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20, and typically between at of about 15 and at or about 18.  Exemplary
of the surfactants include, but are not limited to, non-ionic surfactants, such as sugar ester surfactants, such as sucrose fatty acid ester (SFAE) surfactants, which typically include sucrose fatty acid monoesters, such as sucrose monolaurate, sucrose
monopalmitate, sucrose monostearate, and sucrose monooleate, and all mixtures of a SFAE(s) and a PEG-derivative of vitamin E, such as TPGS or an analog thereof.  Typically, the surfactant is a natural surfactant, for example, a surfactant that is
G.R.A.S.  (generally recognized as safe) by the FDA and/or Kosher certified.
<br/><br/> As used herein, analog refers to a chemical compound that is structurally similar to another compound (referred to as a parent compound), but differs slightly in composition, for example, by the variation, addition or removal of an atom, one or
more units (e.g., methylene unit(s), --(CH.sub.2).sub.n--) or one or more functional groups.  The analog can have different chemical or physical properties compared with the original compound and/or can have improved biological and/or chemical activity. 
Alternatively, the analog can have similar or identical chemical or physical properties compared with the original compound and/or can have similar or identical biological and/or chemical activity.  For example, the analog can be more hydrophilic or it
can have altered reactivity as compared to the parent compound.  The analog can mimic the chemical and/or biologically activity of the parent compound (i.e., it can have similar or identical activity), or, in some cases, can have increased or decreased
activity.  The analog can be a naturally or non-naturally occurring (e.g., synthetic) variant of the original compound.  Other types of analogs include isomers (e.g., enantiomers, diastereomers) and other types of chiral variants of a compound, as well
as structural isomers.  The analog can be a branched or cyclic variant of a linear compound.  For example, a linear compound can have an analog that is branched or otherwise substituted to impart certain desirable properties (e.g., improve hydrophobicity
or bioavailability).  Exemplary of the analogs used in the provided compositions and methods are sucrose fatty acid ester analogs, which can be used as surfactants in place of the sucrose fatty acid ester parent compound surfactants in the provided
compositions.
<br/><br/> As used herein, homolog refers to an analog that differs from the parent compound only by the presence or absence of a simple unit, such as a methylene unit, or some multiple of such units, e.g., --(CH.sub.2).sub.n--.  Typically, a homolog has
similar chemical and physical properties as the parent compound.  Exemplary of the homologs used in the provided compositions and methods are sucrose fatty acid ester homologs.
<br/><br/> As used herein, a PEG derivative of Vitamin E is a compound containing one or more Vitamin E moiety (e.g., a tocopherol or tocotrienol) joined, for example by an ester, ether amide or thioester bond, with one or more polyethylene glycol (PEG)
moieties, via a linker, for example a dicarboxylic or tricarboxylic acid.  Exemplary of PEG derivatives of Vitamin E are tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS), TPGS analogs, TPGS homologs and TPGS derivatives.
<br/><br/> As used herein, a tocopherol polyethylene glycol diester (TPGD) is a PEG-derivative of tocopherol where the linker is a dicarboxylic acid (a carboxylic acid having two carboxy groups, e.g., succinic acid), such as succinic acid.  Exemplary of
dicarboxylic acids that can be used as linkers in these tocopherol and tocotrienol PEG diester surfactants are succinic acid, sebacic acid, dodecanedioic acid, suberic acid, or azelaic acid, citraconic acid, methylcitraconic acid, itaconic acid, maleic
acid, glutaric acid, glutaconic acid, fumaric acids and phthalic acids.  Exemplary of TPGDs are tocopherol succinate polyethylene glycol (TPGS), tocopherol sebacate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol dodecanodioate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol suberate
polyethylene glycol, tocopherol azelaate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol citraconate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol methylcitraconate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol itaconate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol maleate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol
glutarate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol glutaconate polyethylene glycol, and tocopherol phthalate polyethylene glycol, among others.
<br/><br/> As used herein, "tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate" "TPGS," "tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate surfactant" and "TPGS surfactant" refer to tocopherol polyethylene glycol (PEG) diesters, that are formed by joining, via
esterification, tocopherol succinate, which itself is an ester made by esterification of tocopherol and succinic acid.  The term tocopherol refers to any naturally occurring or synthetic form of vitamin E, and can refer to a single compound or a mixture. Examples of tocopherols include, for example, .alpha.-tocopherol, D-.alpha.-tocopherol, .beta.-tocopherol, .gamma.-tocopherol, and .delta.-tocopherol.  The PEG moiety of the TPGS surfactant can be any PEG moiety, for example, PEG moieties between 200 kDa
or about 200 kDa and 20,000 kDa or about 20,000 kDa, typically between 200 kDa or about 200 kDa and 6000 kDa or about 6000 kDa, for example, between 600 kDa or about 600 kDa and 6000 kDa or about 6000 kDa, typically between 200 kDa or about 200 kDa and
2000 kDa or about 2000 kDa, between 600 kDa or about 600 kDa and 1500 kDa or about 1500 kDa, or between 600 kDa or about 600 kDa and 1000 kDa or about 1000 kDa, for example, 200 kDa or about 200 kDa, 300 kDa or about 300 kDa, 400 kDa or about 400 kDa,
500 kDa or about 500 kDa, 600 kDa or about 600 kDa, 800 kDa or about 800 kDa, and 1000 kDa or about 1000 kDa; and PEG moieties that are modified, for example, methylated PEG (m-PEG)) and/or PEG moieties including other PEG analogs, e.g., PEG-NHS,
PEG-aldehyde, PEG-SH, PEG-NH.sub.2, PEG-CO.sub.2H, and branched PEGs.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the TPGS surfactants is TPGS-1000, which has a PEG moiety of 1000 kDa.  The TPGS can be any natural, water-soluble, tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate, for example, the food grade TPGS sold under the name Eastman Vitamin E
TPGS.RTM., food grade, by Eastman Chemical Company, Kingsport, Tenn.  This TPGS is water-soluble form of natural-source vitamin E, which is prepared by esterifying the carboxyl group of crystalline d-alpha-tocopheryl acid succinate with polyethylene
glycol 1000 (PEG 1000), and contains between 260 and 300 mg/g total tocopherol.  A similar compound can be made by esterifying the carboxyl group of the d,1 form of synthetic Vitamin E with PEG 1000.  It forms a clear liquid when dissolved 20% in water. 
This tocopheryl polyethylene glycol is a water-soluble preparation of a fat-soluble vitamin (vitamin E), for example, as disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  3,102,078, 2,680,749 and U.S.  Published Application Nos.  2007/0184117 and 2007/0141203.  Also
exemplary of the TPGS surfactant that can be used in the provided compositions is the Water Soluble Natural Vitamin E (TPGS), sold by ZMC-USA, The Woodlands, Tex.  Any known source of TPGS can be used.  Typically, the TPGS surfactant is GRAS and Kosher
certified.  TPGS typically has an HLB value of between 16 or about 16 and 18 or about 18.
<br/><br/> As used herein, analog refers to a chemical compound that is structurally similar to another compound (referred to as a parent compound), but differs slightly in composition, for example, by the variation, addition or removal of an atom, one or
more units (e.g., methylene unit(s), --(CH.sub.2).sub.n--) or one or more functional groups.  The analog can have different chemical or physical properties compared with the original compound and/or can have improved biological and/or chemical activity. 
Alternatively, the analog can have similar or identical chemical or physical properties compared with the original compound and/or can have similar or identical biological and/or chemical activity.  For example, the analog can be more hydrophilic or it
can have altered reactivity as compared to the parent compound.  The analog can mimic the chemical and/or biologically activity of the parent compound (i.e., it can have similar or identical activity), or, in some cases, can have increased or decreased
activity.  The analog can be a naturally or non-naturally occurring (e.g., synthetic) variant of the original compound.  Other types of analogs include isomers (e.g., enantiomers, diastereomers) and other types of chiral variants of a compound, as well
as structural isomers.  The analog can be a branched or cyclic variant of a linear compound.  For example, a linear compound can have an analog that is branched or otherwise substituted to impart certain desirable properties (e.g., improve hydrophobicity
or bioavailability).  Exemplary of the analogs used in the provided compositions and methods are TPGS analogs, which can be used as surfactants in place of the TPGS in the provided compositions.
<br/><br/> As used herein, homolog refers to an analog that differs from the parent compound only by the presence or absence of a simple unit, such as a methylene unit, or some multiple of such units, e.g., --(CH.sub.2).sub.n--.  Typically, a homolog has
similar chemical and physical properties as the parent compound.  Exemplary of the homologs used in the provided compositions and methods are TPGS homologs.
<br/><br/> As used herein, "tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate analog", "TPGS analog", and "TPGS analog surfactant" refer to compounds, other than TPGS, that are similar to a parent TPGS compound, but differ slightly in composition, for example, by
the variation, addition or removal of an atom, one or more units (e.g., methylene unit(s)--(CH.sub.2).sub.n) or one or more functional groups.  TPGS analogs include Vitamin E derived surfactants, including PEG derivatives of Vitamin E, including vitamin
E PEG diesters, such as, but not limited to, tocopherol polyethylene glycol sebacate (PTS), tocopherol polyethylene glycol dodecanodioate (PTD), tocopherol polyethylene glycol suberate (PTSr), tocopherol polyethylene glycol azelaate (PTAz), and
polyoxyethanyl tocotrienyl sebacate (PTrienS) as well as other PEG derivatives of Vitamin E. In one example, the surfactant in the provided compositions is a TPGS analog.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of TPGS analogs are compounds, other than TPGS compounds, having the formula shown in Scheme I:
<br/><br/> ##STR00001## where R.sup.1, R.sup.2, R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 each independently is hydrogen (H) or methyl (CH.sub.2); each dashed line is, independently, a single or double bond; n is an integer from 1 to 5000; m and q each independently are 0 or 1;
and p is an integer from 1 to 20.
<br/><br/> For example, TPGS analogs include, but are not limited to, compounds having the formula in Scheme I, where, when the bonds represented by the dashed lines marked by "A" and "B" are single bonds, and each of m and q equals 0, p is any integer
from 2-20.  TPGS analogs also include compounds where the dashed line at B or the dashed line at A, or both the dashed lines, represents at least one double bond.  For example, TPGS analogs include a compound as in Scheme I, where when the dashed line in
A represents only single bonds, the dashed line in "B" represents one or more double bond, e.g., tocotrienol PEG diesters.  TPGS analogs also include compounds as in Scheme I, where when the dashed line marked "B" represents only single bonds, the dashed
line marked "A" represents one or more double bonds; or when the dashed line labeled "A" does not represent double bonds, and each of m and q is zero, p is greater than 1.  For example, TPGS analogs include compounds where one or more of the dashed lines
represents a double bond, for example, PEG derivatives of tocotrienol esters (e.g., PTrienS).
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of TPGS analogs are compounds, other than TPGS compounds, having the formula shown in Scheme II:
<br/><br/> ##STR00002## where R.sup.1, R.sup.2, R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 each independently is hydrogen (H) or methyl (CH.sub.2); the bond represented by the dashed line is either a single or double bond; and m is a integer from 1 to 20, and n is an integer
from 1 to 5000.
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of TPGS analogs include compounds other than TPGS, having PEG moieties that vary in chain length, according to the formula shown in Scheme III:
<br/><br/> ##STR00003## where R.sup.1, R.sup.2, R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 each independently is hydrogen (H) or methyl (CH.sub.2), and n is an integer from 1 to 5000.
<br/><br/> As used herein, TPGS-1000 analogs are compounds other than TPGS-1000 that are similar to a parent TPGS-1000 compound, but differ slightly in composition, for example, by the variation, addition or removal of an atom, one or more units (e.g.,
methylene unit(s)--(CH.sub.2).sub.n) or one or more functional groups.  In one example, the surfactant in the compositions provided herein is a TPGS-1000 analog.  Suitable TPGS-1000 analogs include, but are not limited to, other TPGS compounds, having
PEG moiety(ies) that vary in chain length and molecular weight compared to TPGS-1000, including, for example, TPGS compounds having PEG moieties between 200 or about 200 kDa and 20,000 kDa or about 20,000 kDa, typically between 200 kDa or about 200 kDa
and 6000 kDa or about 6000 kDa, for example, between 600 kDa or about 600 kDa and 6000 kDa or about 6000 kDa, typically between 200 kDa or about 200 kDa and 2,000 kDa or about 2,000 kDa, between 600 kDa or about 600 kDa and 1500 kDa or about 1500 kDa,
such as, but not limited to, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, and 1000 kDa.  Also exemplary of TPGS-1000 analogs are TPGS compounds having PEG moieties that are modified, for example, methylated PEG (m-PEG) and/or PEG moieties including other PEG analogs,
e.g., PEG-NHS, PEG-aldehyde, PEG-SH, PEG-NH.sub.2, PEG-CO.sub.2H, and branched PEGs.  Also exemplary of TPGS-1000 analogs are any TPGS analogs, e.g., Vitamin E derived surfactants, including PEG derivatives of Vitamin E, including vitamin E PEG diesters,
such as, but not limited to, tocopherol polyethylene glycol sebacate (PTS), tocopherol polyethylene glycol dodecanodioate (PTD), tocopherol polyethylene glycol suberate (PTSr), tocopherol polyethylene glycol azelaate (PTAz) and polyoxyethanyl tocotrienyl
sebacate (PTrienS) as well as other PEG derivatives of Vitamin E.
<br/><br/> As used herein, TPGS homologs are analogs of TPGS that differ from a TPGS parent compound only by the presence or absence of a simple unit, such as a methylene unit, or some multiple of such units, e.g., --(CH.sub.2).sub.n--.  In one aspect,
TPGS homologs are used as surfactants in the provided compositions.  Typically, suitable TPGS homologs have similar surfactant properties compared to the parent compound (TPGS), for example, similar HLB values, for example, HLB values between 14 or about
14 and 20 or about 20.  Exemplary of TPGS homologs are tocopherol polyethylene glycol sebacate (PTS), tocopherol polyethylene glycol dodecanodioate (PTD), tocopherol polyethylene glycol suberate (PTSr), tocopherol polyethylene glycol azelaate (PTAz). 
Exemplary of TPGS homologs are compounds having the formula in Scheme I (above), where neither the A or B dashed line represents a double bond and where, when each of m and q is 0, p is greater than 1.
<br/><br/> As used herein, TPGS-1000 homologs are analogs of TPGS-1000 that differ from a TPGS-1000 parent compound only by the presence or absence of a simple unit, such as a methylene unit, or some multiple of such units, e.g., --(CH.sub.2).sub.n--. 
Suitable TPGS-1000 homologs have similar surfactant properties compared to the parent compound (TPGS-1000), for example, similar HLB values, for example, HLB values between 14 or about 14 and 20 or about 20.  Suitable TPGS-1000 homologs include TPGS-1000
homologs with slight variations in the length of the PEG chain moiety, and me-TPGS-1000, which is a TPGS-1000 having a methyl cap on the PEG moiety.
<br/><br/> As used herein, HLB refers to a value that is used to index and describe a surfactant according to its relative hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, relative to other surfactants.  A surfactant's HLB value is an indication of the molecular balance of
the hydrophobic and lipophilic portions of the surfactant, which is an amphipathic molecule.  Each surfactant and mixture of surfactants (and/or co-surfactants) has an HLB value that is a numerical representation of the relative weight percent of
hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions of the surfactant molecule(s).  HLB values are derived from a semi-empirical formula.  The relative weight percentages of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups are indicative of surfactant properties, including the
molecular structure, for example, the types of aggregates the surfactant will form and the solubility of the surfactant.  See, for example, Griffin, W. C. J. Soc.  Cos.  Chem. 1:311 (1949).
<br/><br/> Surfactant HLB values range from 1-45, while the range for non-ionic surfactants typically is from 1-20.  The more lipophilic a surfactant is, the lower its HLB value.  Conversely, the more hydrophilic a surfactant is, the higher its HLB value. 
Lipophilic surfactants have greater solubility in oil and lipophilic substances, while hydrophilic surfactants dissolve more easily in aqueous media.  In general, surfactants with HLB values greater than 10 or greater than about 10 are called
"hydrophilic surfactants," while surfactants having HLB values less than 10 or less than about 10 are referred to as "hydrophobic surfactants." HLB values have been determined and are available for a plurality of surfactants (e.g., see U.S.  Pat.  No.
6,267,985).  It should be appreciated that HLB values for a given surfactant or co-surfactant can vary, depending upon the empirical method used to determine the value.  Thus, HLB values of surfactants and co-surfactants provide a rough guide for
formulating compositions based on relative hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity.  For example, a surfactant typically is selected from among surfactants having HLB values within a particular range of the surfactant or co-surfactant that can be used to guide
formulations.  Table 1A lists HLB values of exemplary surfactants and co-surfactants.  Table 1B (see section B(1)(c) for exemplary sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants and their HLB values).

<br/><br/> The surfactants and HLB values set forth in Table 1A and Table 1B (below, see section B(1)(c)) are exemplary.  Any known surfactant or co-surfactant can be used with the provided compositions (see, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,267,985).  The
surfactant(s) contained in the provided compositions typically have an HLB value between 14 or about 14 and 20 or about 20, for example, 14 or about 14, 15 or about 15, 16 or about 16, 17 or about 17, 18 or about 18, 19 or about 19, and 20 or about 20.
<br/><br/> As used herein, micelle refers to aggregates formed by surfactants that typically form when the surfactant is present in an aqueous composition, typically when the surfactant is used at a concentration above the critical micelle concentration
(CMC).  In micelles, the hydrophilic portions of the surfactant molecules contact the aqueous or the water phase, while the hydrophobic portions form the core of the micelle, which can encapsulate non-polar ingredient(s), for example, the non-polar
compounds in the provided compositions.  Typically, the surfactants in the provided compositions form micelles containing the non-polar ingredient at their center in aqueous liquid dilution compositions.  Typically, the micelles in the provided
compositions have a particle size of about 1000 nm, typically, less than 500 nm or less than about 500 nm, typically less than 300 or about 300 nm, for example, less than 250 nm or about 250 nm, for example, less than 200 nm or less than about 200 nm,
for example, less than or less than about 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150,
160, 170, 180, 190, or 200 nm.
<br/><br/> As used herein, inverse micelles are surfactant aggregates that typically form in lipophilic solution, with the hydrophilic portions forming the core.  When the cross sectional area of the hydrophobic region of the surfactant molecule is greater
than that of the hydrophilic part of the molecule, the formation of micelles, which can be hexagonal phase structures, is favored.
<br/><br/> As used herein, liposomes are surfactant aggregates composed of lipid bilayers, typically having an aqueous core.  Liposomes typically are formed by lipid surfactants, typically, phospholipids, which are amphipathic, phosphate-containing lipids,
for example, molecules containing one phosphate, a glycerol and one or more fatty acids, and similar surfactants.  Alternatively, phospholipid surfactants can be used as co-surfactants, which can be incorporated into aggregates of other surfactant(s),
for example, micelles.  Lipid bilayers are two dimensional sheets in which all of the hydrophobic portions, e.g., acyl side chains, are shielded from interaction with aqueous liquid, except those at the ends of the sheet.  An energetically unfavorable
interaction of the acyl chains with water results in the folding of the bilayers to form liposomes, three-dimensional lipid bilayer vesicles.  In one example, the liposome is formed as a single bilayer enclosing a single aqueous space (small unilamellar
vesicles; SUVS).  In another example, the liposome is composed of concentric bilayers with many aqueous spaces alternating with the bilayers (multilamellar vesicles; MLVS).  Liposomes can be used to encapsulate hydrophobic and hydrophilic active
ingredients.  In liposomes, non-polar active ingredients typically are partitioned within the bilayers whereas hydrophilic active ingredients typically are trapped within the aqueous compartments.  In one example, liposomes can be advantages as a
carrier/encapsulation system because they are stable and can protect the active ingredients from degradation, e.g., by oxygen and digestive enzymes.
<br/><br/> As used herein, "co-surfactant" is used to refer to a surfactant, typically a phospholipid, that is used, in the provided compositions, in combination with a surfactant (e.g., a primary surfactant), for example, to improve the emulsification of
the provided compositions and/or compounds, for example, to emulsify the ingredients.  In one example, the provided compositions contain at least one surfactant and at least one co-surfactant.  Typically, the co-surfactant is a lipid, for example, a
phospholipid, for example, phosphatidylcholine.  In one example, the co-surfactant has an HLB value of between 7 or about 7 and 8 or about 8.  Typically, the co-surfactant represents a lower percent, by weight (w/w), of the provided compositions,
compared to the surfactant.  Thus, the provided compositions typically have a lower concentration of the co-surfactant(s) than of the surfactant.
<br/><br/> As used herein, a phospholipid is an amphipathic, phosphate-containing lipid, for example, a molecule containing one phosphate, a glycerol and one or more fatty acids.  In one example, one or more phospholipids is used as a co-surfactant in the
provided compositions.  Exemplary of the phospholipids used in the provided compositions are lecithin, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol
(PG), phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylinositol (PI), sphingomyelin (SPM) or a combination thereof.  Typically, the phospholipid is phosphatidylcholine (PC), which sometimes is referred to by the general name "lecithin." Exemplary of the phospholipids
that can be used as co-surfactants in the provided compositions are the phospholipids sold by Lipoid, LLC, Newark, N.J., for example, Purified Egg Lecithins, Purified Soybean Lecithins, Hydrogenated Egg and Soybean Lecithins, Egg Phospholipids, Soybean
Phospholipids, Hydrogenated Egg and Soybean Phospholipids.  Synthetic Phospholipids, PEG-ylated Phospholipids and phospholipid blends sold by Lipoid, LLC.  Exemplary of the phosphatidylcholine that can be used as a co-surfactant in the provided
compositions is the phosphatidylcholine composition sold by Lipoid, LLC, under the name Lipoid S100, which is derived from soy extract and contains greater than 95% or greater than about 95% phosphatidylcholine.
<br/><br/> Typically, for micelle formation, surfactant(s) are used in which the cross sectional area of the hydrophilic portion of the surfactant molecule is greater than that of the hydrophobic portion of the molecule.  For example, sucrose fatty acid
ester surfactants having an HLB within the range of between at or about 14 and at or about 20, typically between at or about 15 and at or about 18, are surfactants for stabilizing oil-in-water emulsions containing the non-polar active ingredients, for
example, in nanometer-sized droplets suspended or dispersed in an aqueous phase or aqueous liquid, for example, aqueous medium, as spherical micelles, containing the hydrophilic portions of the molecule(s) facing the aqueous phase and the hydrophobic
portions at the center of the spherical micelles, for example, surrounding the non-polar active ingredient.  Typically, the surfactants and/or co-surfactants in the provided compositions aggregate in the nanoemulsions and the aqueous liquids to form
micelles, which contain the non-polar compound(s).  The hydrophilic portion(s) of the surfactant molecules are oriented toward the outside of the micelle, in contact with the aqueous medium, while the hydrophobic portion(s) of the surfactant molecules
are oriented toward the center of the micelle, in contact with the non-polar compound(s), which is contained in the center of the micelle.  The micelles can contain more than one surfactant.
<br/><br/> As used herein, "particle size" and "average particle size" refer synonymously to the average diameter of particles in a provided liquid, for example, the droplet diameter or micelle diameter in an emulsion.  Typically, the provided nanoemulsion
concentrates, and the liquids made from the concentrates, have a particle size of less than about 1000 nm, typically, less than 500 nm or less than about 500 nm, typically less than 300 nm or about 300 nm, for example, less than 250 nm or about 250 nm,
for example, less than 200 nm or less than about 200 nm, for example, less than or less than about 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47,
48, 49, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or 200 nm.  In one example, the dilution compositions yielded by diluting the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates have a particle size between 10 nm or about 10 nm and 1000 nm or
about 1000 nm, for example, between 15 nm or about 15 nm and 500 nm or about 500 nm, for example, between 15 nm or about 15 nm and 300 nm or about 300 nm, for example, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200 nm or more.  Typically, the provided liquid nanoemulsion concentrates are formulated such that, dilution of the liquid
nanoemulsion concentrates in an aqueous medium yields a liquid dilution composition having an appropriate particle size, for example, between 15 nm or about 15 nm and 500 nm or about 500 nm.  Information about particles in the liquid dilution
compositions, alternatively, can be expressed in terms of particle density, for example, ppm (parts per million) or percent solids, in the liquids.
<br/><br/> As used herein, visible particles are particles, for example, in a liquid, for example, an emulsion, that are visible when viewing the liquid with the naked eye (e.g., without magnification).  In one example, the visible particles are particles
that are observed by the artisan formulating the compositions, for example, the concentrates or the aqueous liquid dilution compositions containing the diluted concentrates.  In one example, the provided compositions contain no visible particles.  In
another example, the compositions contain few visible particles, for example, no more visible particles than another liquid, for example, a beverage.  The presence of visible particles and the number of visible particles is determined by empirical
observation.
<br/><br/> As used herein, visible crystals are crystals that are visible when viewing a liquid with the naked eye (e.g., without magnification).  The presence or absence of visible crystals typically is determined by empirical observation and can be
observed by the artisan formulating the compositions, for example, the concentrates or the aqueous liquid dilution compositions containing the diluted concentrates.  In one example, the provided compositions contain no visible crystals.  In another
example, the compositions contain few visible crystals, for example, no more visible crystals than are contained in another liquid, for example, a beverage.
<br/><br/> As used herein, "turbidity" is a measure of the cloudiness or haziness of a liquid, caused by particles in suspension in the liquid.  Turbidity can measured optically, for example, using a nephelometer, an instrument with a light and a detector. The nephelometer measures turbidity by detecting scattered light resulting from exposure of the liquid to an incident light.  The amount of scattered light correlates to the amount of particulate matter in the liquid.  For example, a beam of light will
pass through a sample with low turbidity with little disturbance.  Other methods for measuring turbidity are well known and can be used with the provided methods and compositions.  The units of a turbidity value measured with a nephelometer are
Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU).  In one example, the provided compositions, e.g., the aqueous liquid dilution compositions containing the diluted liquid nanoemulsion concentrates, have low turbidity, for example, a turbidity value (NTU) of 30 or
about 30; or an NTU value of less than 30 or about 30, for example, less than 29 or about 29, less than 28 or about 28, less than 27 or about 27, less than 26 or about 26, less than 25 or about 25, less than 24 or about 24, less than 23 or about 23, less
than 22 or about 22, less than 21 or about 21, less than 20 or about 20, less than 19 or about 19, less than 18 or about 18, less than 17 or about 17, less than 16 or about 16, less than 15 or about 15, less than 14 or about 14, less than 13 or about 13,
less than 12 or about 12, less than 11 or about 11, less than 10 or about 10, less than 9 or about 9, less than 8 or about 8, less than 7 or about 7, less than 6 or about 6, less than 5 or about 5, less than 4 or about 4, less than 3 or about 3, less
than 2 or about 2, less than 1 or about 1; or 29 or about 29, 28 or about 28, 27 or about 27, 26 or about 26, 25 or about 25, 24 or about 24, 23 or about 23, 22 or about 22, 21 or about 21, 20 or about 20, 19 or about 19, 18 or about 18, 17 or about 17,
16 or about 16, 15 or about 15, 14 or about 14, 13 or about 13, 12 or about 12, 11 or about 11, 10 or about 10, 9 or about 9, 8 or about 8, 7 or about 7, 6 or about 6, 5 or about 5, 4 or about 4, 3 or about 3, 2 or about 2, 1 or about 1, or 0 or about 0. In another example, the turbidity value of the aqueous liquid dilution composition is less than 1000 or less than about 1000, less than 500 or less than about 500, less than 300 or less than about 300, less than 250 or less than about 250, 200 or less
than about 200, for example, 200, 175, 150, 100, 50, 25 or less.
<br/><br/> As used herein, a turbid liquid is one that is thick or opaque with visible particles in suspension, for example, a liquid that is cloudy or muddy in appearance.
<br/><br/> As used herein, "clear" can be used to describe a composition as provided herein, for example, the aqueous liquid dilution compositions containing the diluted nanoemulsion concentrates and/or the nanoemulsion concentrates themselves.  In one
example, a clear liquid is one that does not appear cloudy by empirical observation (e.g., to the naked eye) and/or does not contain particles or crystals that are visible to the naked eye, or that does not exhibit "ringing." In another example, a clear
liquid is one that has a low or relatively low turbidity value, for example an NTU value, that is less than or equal to a desired NTU value.  In one example, a clear liquid has an NTU value of less than 300 or less than about 300, typically less than 250
or less than about 250, typically less than 200 or less than about 200, for example, 200, 175, 150, 100, 50, 25 or less.  In another example, a liquid is clear if it has a turbidity value (NTU) of 30 or about 30; or an NTU value of less than 30 or about
30, for example, less than 29 or about 29, less than 28 or about 28, less than 27 or about 27, less than 26 or about 26, less than 25 or about 25, less than 24 or about 24, less than 23 or about 23, less than 22 or about 22, less than 21 or about 21,
less than 20 or about 20, less than 19 or about 19, less than 18 or about 18, less than 17 or about 17, less than 16 or about 16, less than 15 or about 15, less than 14 or about 14, less than 13 or about 13, less than 12 or about 12, less than 11 or
about 11, less than 10 or about 10, less than 9 or about 9, less than 8 or about 8, less than 7 or about 7, less than 6 or about 6, less than 5 or about 5, less than 4 or about 4, less than 3 or about 3, less than 2 or about 2, less than 1 or about 1; or
29 or about 29, 28 or about 28, 27 or about 27, 26 or about 26, 25 or about 25, 24 or about 24, 23 or about 23, 22 or about 22, 21 or about 21, 20 or about 20, 19 or about 19, 18 or about 18, 17 or about 17, 16 or about 16, 15 or about 15, 14 or about
14, 13 or about 13, 12 or about 12, 11 or about 11, 10 or about 10, 9 or about 9, 8 or about 8, 7 or about 7, 6 or about 6, 5 or about 5, 4 or about 4, 3 or about 3, 2 or about 2, 1 or about 1, or 0 or about 0.  In another example, a clear liquid is one
that has a small or relatively small average particle size (e.g., less than 1000 nm or about 1000 nm, typically less than 500 nm or less than about 500 nm, typically less than 300 nm or about 300 nm, typically less than 250 nm or about 250 nm, typically
less than 200 nm or about 200 nm, for example, less than 150 or about 150 nm, less than 100 nm or about 100 nm, less than 75 nm or about 75 nm, less than 50 nm or about 50 nm, less than 25 nm or about 25 nm or less than 10 nm or about 10 nm), for
example, less than or less than about 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150,
160, 170, 180, 190, or 200 nm.
<br/><br/> In another example, clarity is expressed relatively.  For example, it can be desired that a particular composition is equally as clear, about as clear, or more clear than another liquid (as measured empirically, or by measuring turbidity value
or particle size).  For example, clarity can be assessed relative to another aqueous liquid dilution composition, for example, a beverage.  For example, In one example, a liquid is clear if it is similar in appearance to another clear liquid, for
example, a beverage, for example, water.  For example, it can be desired that a composition has a particle size that is less than or equal to another liquid, for example, a beverage.  In another example, it can be desired that a composition has a
turbidity value that is less than or equal to another liquid, for example, a beverage.  Thus, when the nanoemulsion concentrates provided herein are diluted into an aqueous medium, the resulting compositions is about as clear or is as clear or is within
about 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 NTU of the aqueous medium prior to addition of the concentrate.
<br/><br/> As used herein, "hydrophilic" and "polar" refer synonymously to ingredients and/or compounds having greater solubility in aqueous liquids, for example, water, than in fats, oils and/or organic solvents (e.g., methanol ethanol, ethyl ether,
acetone and benzene).
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the polar ingredients in the provided compositions are polar solvents, which are solvents more readily miscible with water and other polar ingredients.  Thus, polar ingredients are more readily dissolved in polar solvents than
non-polar solvents.  Polar solvents are well-known.  The polarity of a solvent can be assessed by measuring a number of different parameters according to well known methods as described herein (see, e.g., Prizbytek, "High Purity Solvent Guide," Burdick
and Jackson Laboratories, Inc., 1980).  Polar solvents generally have high dielectric constants, typically dielectric constants greater than at or about 15, such as at or about 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33,
34, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80 85, 90, or greater than 90, and generally have high polarity indices, typically greater than at or about 3, such as at or about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 or greater than 9.  Polar solvents generally have large
dipole moments, typically greater than at or about 1.4 Debye, such as at or about, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.0, 3.5, 4 or greater than 4 Debye.  Polar solvents include polar protic solvents and polar aprotic
solvents.
<br/><br/> As used herein, a polar protic solvent is a polar solvent containing a hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom, such that the hydrogen has a proton-like character and/or the bond between the hydrogen and electronegative atom is
polarized.  Exemplary polar protic solvents include, but are not limited to water, alcohols, including monohydric, dihydric and trihydric alcohols, including, but not limited to, methanol, ethanol, glycerin, propylene glycol.
<br/><br/> Dihydric alcohols are alcohols containing two hydroxyl groups.  Exemplary dihydric alcohols include, but are not limited to, glycols, e.g., propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol.
<br/><br/> Trihydric alcohols are alcohols containing three hydroxyl groups.  Exemplary trihydric alcohols include, but are not limited to glycerin, butane-1,2,3-triol, pentane -1,3,5-triol, 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol.
<br/><br/> Monohydric alcohols are alcohols containing a single hydroxyl group, including but not limited to, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol and t-butanol.  In one example, the polar solvent in the provided compositions is not a
monohydric alcohol.
<br/><br/> As used herein, "non-polar", "lipophilic", and "lipid-soluble" synonymously refer to compounds (e.g., non-polar compounds) and/or ingredients, for example, non-polar active ingredients, which have greater solubility in organic solvents (e.g.,
ethanol, methanol, ethyl ether, acetone, and benzene) and in fats and oils, than in aqueous liquids, for example, water.  Non-polar compounds include drugs, hormones, vitamins, nutrients and other lipophilic compounds.  Typically, the non-polar compounds
used in the provided compositions are poorly water soluble, for example, water insoluble or compounds having low water solubility.  Exemplary non-polar compounds include non-polar active ingredients, for example, lipid-soluble drugs, hormones, essential
fatty acids, for example, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), for example, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, vitamins, nutrients, nutraceuticals, minerals and other compounds.  Additional exemplary non-polar compounds are described herein.  The provided
compositions can be formulated with any non-polar compound, for example, non-polar active ingredient.
<br/><br/> As used herein, non-polar active ingredient refers to a non-polar compound that, when administered to a subject, for example, a human, induces or is proposed to induce a desired response, such as altering body function at the cellular, tissue,
organ or other level, and/or altering cosmetic appearance or other property, or a non-polar compound that is ingested in order to achieve a desired effect.  Non-polar active ingredients can be any synthetic or natural non-polar ingredient or compound,
including a pharmaceutical, drug, therapeutic, nutritional supplement, herb, hormone or other ingredient.  Non-polar active ingredients can include the non-polar active ingredients listed herein, as well as other pharmaceutically acceptable or food-grade
active derivatives of the active ingredients, for example, salts, esters, amides, prodrugs, active metabolites, isomers, fragments and analogs.  Active ingredients can include compounds proven to have a desired effect and also compounds thought to
produce such effects, for example, compounds typically ingested for nutritional supplementation purposes.
<br/><br/> As used herein, a subject includes an animal, typically a mammal, typically a human.
<br/><br/> As used herein, an additive includes anything that one can add to a food, beverage, or other human consumable, to enhance one or more of its nutritional, pharmaceutical, dietary, health, nutraceutical, health benefit, energy-providing, treating,
holistic, or other properties.  For example, provided herein are compositions and methods for preparing foods, beverages and other aqueous human consumables, that include one or more additives, typically oil based additives (e.g., non-polar compounds),
such as nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, vitamins, typically oil soluble vitamins, for example, Vitamin D, particularly D3, Vitamin E, and Vitamin A, minerals, fatty acids, such as essential fatty acids, e.g., polyunsaturated fatty acids, for example,
omega-3 fatty acids, and omega-6 fatty acids, for example, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), gamma-linolenic acid GLA, CLA, saw palmetto extract, flaxseed oil, fish oil, algae oil, phytosterols, and
Coenzymes, for example, Coenzyme Q10 and other additives.
<br/><br/> As used herein, an effective amount of an additive, such as a non-polar compound, such as a non-polar active ingredient, refers to the quantity and/or concentration of the additive necessary for preventing, curing, ameliorating, arresting or
partially arresting a symptom of a disease or disorder, or the quantity and/or concentration desired by an individual for intake, such as daily intake, and/or nutritional supplementation, for example, an amount sufficient to enhance the nutritional,
pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, health or energy property of a food, beverage, or other consumable.  In some examples, it is desired that the provided compositions, for example, the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates and/or the liquid dilution compositions,
contain an effective amount of a particular non-polar compound, for example, a particular amount per volume or weight of the composition.
<br/><br/> In one example, an effective amount is a concentration or amount of a liquid nanoemulsion composition where at least 25 mg or about 25 mg, typically at least 35 mg, for example, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120,
130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, 475, 500, 550, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1500, 2000 mg, or more, of the non-polar active ingredient, is contained in at least 8 fluid
ounces of an aqueous medium, e.g., a beverage.
<br/><br/> As used herein, unit dose form refers to physically discrete units suitable for human and animal subjects and packaged individually as is known in the art.
<br/><br/> As used herein, "water insoluble" refers to a property of a compound, none of which dissolves when the compound is mixed with water, for example, when mixed with water at room temperature, for example, between 25 and 50.degree.  C. or between
about 25 and 50.degree.  C. In one example, the non-polar compounds are water insoluble.  In another example, the non-polar compounds in the provided compositions are slightly soluble in water, for example, having low water solubility.

68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84 or 85.degree.  C., for example, not more than 85.degree.  C. or about 85.degree.  C., typically not more than 60.degree.  C. or about 60.degree.  C., typically, 60.degree.  C. or
60.degree.  C. In the provided methods for making the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates, the oil phase and water phase ingredients typically are heated, using low heat, in order to preserve the ingredients, for example, in order to prevent oxidation of
the ingredients, for example, the non-polar active ingredients, for example, the omega-3 containing compounds, for example, the DHA.
<br/><br/> As used herein, "consisting essentially of," means containing the following list of ingredient(s), and not including any additional active ingredient, for example, not including any additional active drug or pharmaceutical.  For example, a
composition, for example, a liquid nanoemulsion, consisting essentially of a listed plurality of ingredients contains those particular ingredients and does not contain any additional active drug or pharmaceutical.
<br/><br/> As used herein, C.sub.1-C.sub.x includes C.sub.1-C.sub.2, C.sub.1-C.sub.3 .  . . C.sub.x.
<br/><br/> As used herein, a sucrose fatty acid ester is a compound having the formula shown in Scheme V, below.
<br/><br/> ##STR00004##
<br/><br/> where each of X.sup.1, X.sup.2, X.sup.3, X.sup.4, X.sup.5, X.sup.6, X.sup.7 and X.sup.8 independently is:
<br/><br/> a hydroxyl (--OH) group, or
<br/><br/> ##STR00005## where:
<br/><br/> each R is an alkyl group having 3-27 carbon atoms; and
<br/><br/> when more than one of X.sup.1, X.sup.2, X.sup.3, X.sup.4, X.sup.5, X.sup.6, X.sup.7 and X.sup.8 is
<br/><br/> ##STR00006##
<br/><br/> each R can be a different alkyl group (e.g., having different number of carbon atoms and/or different saturation), or can be the same alkyl group.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the provided compositions contain sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants that have sucrose fatty acid ester(s) having structures according to Scheme V above, where R typically contains between 7 and 27 carbon atoms.  Typically,
the sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants contain sucrose fatty acid monoesters.  The sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants include mixtures, or blends, of sucrose fatty acid esters, which typically include monoesters, and can also include diesters,
triesters and polyesters.
<br/><br/> A sucrose fatty acid monoester has the structure set forth in Scheme V, where one of X.sup.1, X.sup.2, X.sup.3, X.sup.4, X.sup.5, X.sup.6, X.sup.7 and X.sup.8 (typically X.sup.1) is:
<br/><br/> ##STR00007##
<br/><br/> and the other seven of X.sup.1, X.sup.2, X.sup.3, X.sup.4, X.sup.5, X.sup.6, X.sup.7 and X.sup.8 are each, independently, --OH.
<br/><br/> An exemplary sucrose fatty acid monoester has the following structure:
<br/><br/> ##STR00008##
<br/><br/> where R is an alkyl group having 3-27 carbons.
<br/><br/> Sucrose fatty acid diesters, sucrose fatty acid triesters, and sucrose fatty acid polyesters, respectively, are sucrose fatty acid esters having structures according to Scheme V, above, where two (diesters), three (triesters) or more
(polyesters) of X.sup.1, X.sup.2, X.sup.3, X.sup.4, X.sup.5, X.sup.6, X.sup.7 and X.sup.8, (and typically X.sup.1 and X.sup.8) independently, are
<br/><br/> ##STR00009##
<br/><br/> Thus, the sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants include sucrose monoesters, diesters, triesters and polyesters, and mixtures thereof, and typically contain sucrose monoesters.  The sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants include single fatty acid
esters and also include homogeneous mixtures of sucrose esters, containing two or more sucrose fatty acid esters with different lengths of fatty acid carbon chains and/or members with different degrees of esterification.  For example, the sucrose fatty
acid ester surfactants include mixtures of monoesters, diesters, triesters, and/or polyesters.  The sucrose fatty acid ester mixtures can include one or more sucrose fatty acid esters, such as, but not limited to, sucrose stearate, sucrose laurate,
sucrose palmitate, sucrose oleate, sucrose caprylate, sucrose decanoate, sucrose myristate, sucrose pelargonate, sucrose undecanoate, sucrose tridecanoate, sucrose pentadeconoate and sucrose heptadecanoate, and homologs thereof.
<br/><br/> As used herein, the term "alkyl" and "alkyl group" refer to straight or branched chain substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon groups having any number of carbon atoms; number of carbon atoms can be specified, for example, 1 to 30 carbon atoms,
8 to 28 carbon atoms, 7 to 27 carbon atoms, 8 to 22 carbon atoms, 8 to 20 carbon atoms, 8 to 18 carbon atoms and 12 to 18 carbon atoms.  An alkyl group can be a "saturated alkyl," meaning that it does not contain any alkene or alkyne groups or an
"unsaturated alkyl," meaning that it contains at least one alkene or alkyne group, an optionally can be substituted.  An alkyl group that includes at least one carbon-carbon double bond (C.dbd.C) also is referred to by the term "alkenyl;" alkenyl groups
optionally can be substituted.  An alkyl group that includes at least one carbon-carbon triple bond (C.ident.C) also is referred to by the term "alkynyl;" alkynyl groups optionally can be substituted.
<br/><br/> As used herein, the singular forms "a," "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.  Thus, for example, reference to a compound comprising "an extracellular domain" includes compounds with one or a
plurality of extracellular domains.
<br/><br/> B. Compositions Containing Non-Polar Compounds
<br/><br/> Provided herein are compositions containing non-polar compounds and methods for making the compositions.  Non-polar compounds are poorly water soluble (e.g., having low water solubility or being water-insoluble).  Thus, it generally can be
difficult to formulate non-polar compounds into compositions for human consumption, particularly aqueous compositions, for example, foods and beverages.  Poor water solubility of non-polar compounds also can contribute to their poor bioavailability. 
Improved methods and compositions for formulating non-polar compounds are provided herein.
<br/><br/> In general, emulsions (e.g., oil-in-water emulsions) are colloidal dispersions of two immiscible liquids (e.g., oil and water or other aqueous liquid), containing a continuous and a dispersed phase.  Emulsions can be used to disperse non-polar
compounds in aqueous liquids.  In an oil-in-water emulsion, the dispersed phase is an oil phase and the continuous phase is an aqueous (water) phase.  There is a need for emulsions (e.g., oil-in-water emulsions) containing non-polar compounds in aqueous
liquids and methods and compositions for generating the dilutions compositions, such as beverages, that are clear and stable.  In particular, emulsions are needed that are more suitable and desirable for human consumption of the non-polar compounds, for
example, in foods and beverages.  For example, emulsions having improved clarity (e.g., small particle size, low turbidity), stability (e.g., lack of separation), taste and smell, particularly when diluted into a beverage to provide a desired dosage of
an active ingredient are needed and are provided herein.
<br/><br/> Among the provided compositions are such improved emulsions.  For example, emulsions are provided that contain the non-polar compounds dispersed in aqueous liquid and have desirable properties, including improved clarity, stability, smell and
taste.  The provided compositions (and methods for making the compositions) can be used to formulate any non-polar compound in aqueous compositions, including the non-polar compounds (e.g., non-polar active ingredients) described herein and other known
non-polar compounds.
<br/><br/> Typically, the provided emulsions containing the non-polar compounds are nanoemulsions, which are emulsions having dispersed droplets (particles) with diameters less than 1000 nm or less than about 1000 nm, typically, less than 500 nm or less
than about 500 nm, typically less than 300 nm or about 300 nm, typically less than 250 or less than about 250 nm, typically less than 200 nm or less than about 200 nm, for example, less than or less than about 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or 200 nm.  Typically, the provided nanoemulsion compositions
are oil-in-water nanoemulsions, containing the non-polar compounds dispersed in aqueous liquid.
<br/><br/> The provided emulsion compositions are stabilized by one or more surfactants and/or co-surfactants and/or emulsion stabilizers.  Surfactants form an interfacial film in the emulsion, between the oil and water phase, providing stability. 
Typically, the nanoemulsions of the provided compositions contain micelles, in which one or more surfactant surrounds the non-polar active compound.  The micelles are dispersed in the water phase.
<br/><br/> The provided emulsion compositions include liquid nanoemulsion concentrates containing the non-polar compounds, which can be diluted to provide non-polar compounds in aqueous compositions, such as beverages.  The liquid nanoemulsion concentrates
can be diluted into a medium, for example, an aqueous medium for example, a beverage, to form a liquid dilution composition (e.g., aqueous liquid dilution composition) containing the non-polar compound.  Also exemplary of the provided compositions are
the liquid dilution compositions (e.g., aqueous liquid dilution compositions, which can be clear) made by diluting the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates in the medium.
<br/><br/> The compositions can be made using any non-polar compound.  The non-polar compounds typically are non-polar active ingredients, for example, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, vitamins and minerals.  The non-polar active ingredients include, but
are not limited to, Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA)-containing compounds, for example, omega-3-containing active ingredients, for example, compounds containing ALA, DHA and/or EPA, for example, oils derived from fish and microalgae, krill and/or
flaxseed extract, and omega-6-containing non-polar active ingredients, for example, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA)-containing compounds, for example, borage oil; saw palmetto oil-containing compounds; conjugated fatty acid containing-ingredients, for
example, Conjugated Linoleic acid (CLA)-containing compounds; coenzyme Q-containing active ingredients, for example, Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), typically oxidized CoQ10 (ubidecarenone)-containing compounds; and compounds containing phytosterols (plant
sterols).  Additional exemplary non-polar active ingredients are described herein.  Any non-polar compound can be used in the provided compositions.
<br/><br/> 1.  Liquid Nanoemulsion Concentrates Containing the Non-Polar Compounds
<br/><br/> Provided are liquid nanoemulsion concentrates (also called "concentrates" or "liquid concentrates") containing one or more non-polar compounds.  The concentrates can be diluted into aqueous media to form aqueous liquid dilution compositions
containing the non-polar compounds.  The liquid concentrates are formulated based on one or more desirable properties, for example, clarity; safety; taste; smell; stability, for example, lack of phase separation, "ringing" and/or precipitation over time,
and/or bioavailability of the concentrate and/or the aqueous liquid dilution compositions containing the concentrate.  In one example, the desirable property is the ability of the provided concentrate to yield a clear or partially clear aqueous liquid
dilution composition when it is diluted into aqueous medium, for example, a beverage such as water.  In another example, the desirable property relates to the safety of the concentrates and/or the desirability of the concentrates for human consumption,
for example, in foods and beverages.  In another example, it can be desirable that the concentrate contains less than or equal to a particular concentration of one or more ingredients.  In another example, it can be desirable that the concentrate
contains greater than or equal to a particular concentration of one or more ingredients.
<br/><br/> In addition to the non-polar compounds, the concentrates contain at least one surfactant.  Typically, the surfactant has an HLB value between 14 or about 14 and 20 or about 20, for example, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, about 14, about 15, about
16, about 17, about 18, about 19 or about 20.  Exemplary of suitable surfactants are sugar ester surfactants, such as sucrose fatty acid ester (SFAE) surfactants.  Typically, the surfactant is a natural surfactant, for example, a surfactant that is GRAS
(generally recognized as safe) certified by the FDA and/or Kosher certified.
<br/><br/> The liquid concentrates further contain a polar solvent, such as water (e.g., filtered water), or other edible aqueous liquid (e.g., propylene glycol or glycerin), or combination thereof, typically a high amount of the polar solvent, for
example, between 60% or about 60% and 80% or about 80%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate, typically between at or about 60% and at or about 79%, by weight of the concentrate.
<br/><br/> Typically, the concentrates further contain one or more additional ingredients.  Exemplary of additional ingredients that can be included in the concentrates are preservatives, non-polar solvents, co-surfactants, emulsion stabilizers, pH
adjusters and flavoring agents.
<br/><br/> The non-polar compounds in the concentrates and dilution compositions are contained in micelles.  These micelles, containing the non-polar compound surrounded by the one or more surfactants, allow dispersion of the non-polar compound among polar
solvents, for example, when the concentrates are diluted to form aqueous liquid dilution compositions.  The micelles containing the non-polar compounds typically have a small or relatively small particle size, for example, less than 1000 nm or about 1000
nm, less than 500 nm or about 500 nm, typically less than 300 nm or about 300 nm, typically less than 200 nm or about 200 nm, for example, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,
35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 125, 150 or 200 nm.  Smaller particle size correlates with clarity of the aqueous liquid dilution compositions containing the diluted concentrates.  For example, a liquid with a smaller particle
size is more clear than a liquid with a larger particle size.  Small particle size also can contribute to other desirable properties, for example, stability.
<br/><br/> A number of factors, including ingredients, their relative concentrations, and methods for making the concentrates, affect the particle size of the compositions, and other desirable properties of the compositions, such as clarity.  In
particular, the nature of the surfactant, particularly the HLB of the surfactant, and the relative concentrations of polar solvent (e.g., water), surfactant and the non-polar compound, contribute to small particle size, and the clarity of the aqueous
liquid dilution compositions.  Typically, several of these parameters and properties are related to one another.  For example, several of the parameters contribute to the particle size, typically small particle size, of the compositions.  Particle size
contributes directly to clarity of the aqueous liquid dilution compositions containing the concentrates.  Particle size also can relate to other properties, for example, stability, lack of "ringing" and/or precipitate formation of the aqueous liquid
dilution compositions containing the concentrates.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, properties of the ingredients and their relative concentrations in the concentrates are important for the ability of the concentrate to yield desirable dilution compositions.  Provided are methods for formulating the liquid
nanoemulsion concentrates.  Determining the appropriate ingredients, and relative concentrations thereof, that will yield dilution compositions having desirable properties, is performed using provided methods for formulating the liquid concentrates.
<br/><br/> a. Formulating the Liquid Concentrates
<br/><br/> In the provided formulation methods, the concentrates are formulated by selecting ingredients and concentration ratios of the ingredients that yield compositions having one or more desired properties.  When formulating the concentrates, selected
ingredients and starting concentrations are used to make initial concentrates, which are evaluated and modified, if necessary.
<br/><br/> As a first step in formulating the provided concentrates, one or more initial concentrates are made and evaluated for desired properties.  For this step, ingredients are selected, for example, from among the ingredients described herein.  The
ingredients generally include surfactants, polar solvents, non-polar active ingredients, and other ingredients.  A starting concentration (weight percentage) of each selected ingredient is selected from within the appropriate concentration range for that
ingredient or category of ingredient, for example, the appropriate concentration range for the surfactant.  In some cases, the initial concentrate is formulated based on the ingredients, and concentrations thereof, of an existing concentrate, having one
or more desired properties.
<br/><br/> The initial concentrate(s) then is/are made, using the methods for making the concentrates, provided below, adding each ingredient at its starting concentration at the appropriate step.  In one example, more than one initial concentrate, e.g.,
multiple initial concentrates, each having a different concentration of one or more ingredients, is made, and compared.  In one example, multiple initial concentrates are produced to test various representative concentrations within an appropriate
concentration range for one or more particular ingredient.
<br/><br/> In a typical example, the initial concentrate is made by including at least one surfactant, such as from among the surfactants described herein, that has an HLB value between 14 or about 14 and 20 or about 20, at a starting concentration within
the concentration range of between 16% or about 16% and 30% or about 30%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate; at least one non-polar compound, at a starting concentration within the concentration range of between 5% or about 5% and 10% or about 10%; and
a polar solvent, at a starting concentration of between 60% or about 60% and 80% or about 80%, and typically between at or about 60% and at or about 79%, by weight.  In one example, the initial concentrate further includes other ingredients, for example,
preservative(s), co-surfactant(s), and/or other ingredients as described herein.
<br/><br/> After making the initial concentrate(s), the concentrate(s) is evaluated for one or more desired properties, for example, the ability to form dilution compositions (e.g., clear dilution compositions or dilution compositions having a particular
turbidity value, particle size or other property).  The ability to form dilution compositions having one or more properties is determined by diluting the concentrate in aqueous medium, for example, diluting the concentrate in the aqueous medium at a
dilution factor of between 1:10 or about 1:10 and at most 1:1000 or about 1:1000, typically between 1:10 or about 1:10 and 1:500 or about 1:500, for example, at a dilution between 1:10 or about 1:10 and up to 1:250 or about 1:250, for example, diluted
between 1:10 or about 1:10, 1:20 or about 1:20, 1:25 or about 1:25, 1:50 or about 1:50, 1:100 or about 1:100, 1:200 or about 1:200, 1:250 or about 1:250, or up to 1:500 or about 1:500, for example, 1:10, 1:20, 1:25, 1:30, 1:35, 1:40, 1:50, 1:55, 1:60,
1:65, 1:70, 1:75, 1:80, 1:85, 1:90, 1:95, 1:100, 1:110, 1:120, 1:130, 1:140, 1:150, 1:160, 1:170, 1:180, 1:190, 1:200, 1:210, 1:220, 1:230, 1:240, 1:250, 1:260, 1:270, 1:280, 1:290, 1:300, 1:350, 1:400, 1:500, or according to other dilutions provided
herein, and assessing the clarity, turbidity value, particle size, color, smell, taste, safety, stability, "ringing" or forming of precipitates, presence of crystals or other desired property of the resulting dilution composition.
<br/><br/> After evaluation, the ingredients, and/or concentrations thereof, can be adjusted in order to generate the desired properties in the final concentrate.  Typically, the concentration of the non-polar compound, the surfactant, and/or the polar
solvent is the concentration that is adjusted after evaluating the initial concentrate.  Similarly, when formulating multiple initial concentrates, one or more of the non-polar compound, surfactant and polar solvent concentration is/are varied among the
multiple initial concentrates.  In some cases, following evaluation, it can be determined that additional ingredients (not included in the initial formulation) are needed or desirable for achieving the desired properties of a particular concentrate. 
This process can be repeated until a concentrate having the desired property or properties is generated.
<br/><br/> i. Ingredients and Typical Concentration Ranges
<br/><br/> Each of the provided concentrates contains a non-polar compound, such as, but not limited to, the exemplary non-polar compounds described herein below.  Typically, the non-polar compound is a non-polar active ingredient, for example, an
oil-based active ingredient such as a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), a coenzyme Q or a phytochemical.  For formulating the initial concentrate, the starting concentration of the non-polar compound typically is a concentration chosen from within a
concentration range of between 5% or about 5% and 10% or about 10% (w/w) of the concentrate, such as a starting concentration of 5% or about 5%, 6% or about 6%, 7% or about 7%, 8% or about 8%, 9% or about 9%, or 10% or about 10% (w/w) of the concentrate. The non-polar compound typically is added as part of an oil phase, according to the provided methods for making the concentrate.
<br/><br/> The initial concentrate further contains at least one surfactant, which can be added to the water phase or the oil phase, and typically has an HLB value of between 14 or about 14 and 20 or about 20, for example, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20, or
about 14, about 15, about 16, about 17, about 18, about 19, about 20, typically between at or about 15 and at or about 18, including, but not limited to sugar ester surfactants (which typically are sucrose fatty acid surfactants containing monoesters)
and analogs and derivatives thereof, typically a natural surfactant, which is safe and/or approved for human consumption.  The surfactants include a SFAE or mixtures thereof or the SFAE(s) and a PEG-derivative of Vitamin E or an analog thereof.
<br/><br/> Typically, the starting concentration of the surfactant is chosen from within a concentration range of between 16% or about 16% and 30% or about 30% (w/w), for example, 16% or about 16%, 17% or about 17%, 18% or about 18%, 19% or about 19%, 20%
or about 20%, 21% or about 21%, 22% or about 22%, 23% or about 23%, 24% or about 24%, 25% or about 25%, 26% or about 26%, 27% or about 27%, 28% or about 28%, 29% or about 29%, or 30% or about 30%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate, such as, for
example, 17.75%, 20.25%, 20.5%, 22.7%, or 25.2% (w/w) of the concentrate.  When the concentrate contains a mixture of sucrose fatty acid esters and a PEG-derivative of Vitamin E as surfactants, the compositions typically contain at least 1% or at least
about 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% or 10% sucrose fatty esters.
<br/><br/> In one example, the concentration range of the surfactant is between 16% or about 16% and 26% or about 26%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate, such as, for example, between 17% or about 17% and 25% or about 25% (w/w) of the concentrate;
between 18% or about 18% and 26% or about 26% (w/w) of the concentrate; between 16% or about 16% and 18% or about 18% (w/w) of the concentrate; such as, for example, 18% or about 18% (w/w) of the concentrate, 20% or about 20% (w/w) of the concentrate,
23% or about 23% (w/w) of the concentrate, or 25% or about 25% (w/w) of the concentrate.  In another example, the concentration range of the surfactant is between 17% or about 17% and 26% or about 26% (w/w) of the concentrate.  In another example, the
concentration range of the surfactant is between 18% or about 18% and 25% or about 25% (w/w) of the concentrate.  In another example, the concentration range of the surfactant is between 18% or about 18% and 20% or about 20% (w/w) of the concentrate.  In
another example, the concentration range of the surfactant is between 17% or about 17% and 20% or about 20% (w/w) of the concentrate.  In another example, the concentration range of the surfactant is between 16% or about 16% and 20% or about 20% (w/w) of
the concentrate.
<br/><br/> The concentrates further contain polar solvents (e.g., water, or other edible polar solvent, e.g., propylene glycol and glycerin), typically a high concentration of the polar solvent, which is added to the water phase.  Typically, the starting
concentration of polar solvent is chosen from within a concentration range of between 60% or about 60% and 80% or about 80% (w/w) of the concentrate, for example, 60% or about 60%, 61% or about 61%, 62% or about 62%, 63% or about 63%, 64% or about 64%,
65% or about 65%, 66% or about 66%, 67% or about 67%, 68% or about 68%, 69% or about 69%, 70% or about 70%, 71% or about 71%, 72% or about 72%, 73% or about 73%, 74% or about 74%, 75% or about 75%, 76% or about 76%, 77% or about 77%, 78% or about 78%,
79% or about 79%, 80% or about 80% (w/w) of the concentrate, such as, for example, 68.29%, 68.7865%, 69.02%, 74.25%, 71.49%, 71.74%, or 75.8165% (w/w) of the concentrate.  In one example, the concentration range of the polar solvent is between 65% or
about 65% and 80% or about 80% (w/w) of the concentrate.  In another example, the concentration range of the polar solvent is between 65% or about 65% and 75% or about 75% (w/w) of the concentrate or between 65% or about 65% and 76% or about 76% (w/w) of
the concentrate.
<br/><br/> One or more, typically more than one, additional ingredients can be added to the initial concentrate.  For example, the concentrates typically contain at least one preservative, typically a natural preservative, for example, benzyl alcohol. 
Exemplary of other additional ingredients that can be added to the concentrates, including the initial concentrates, are emulsion stabilizers, for example, a blend of gums; a non-polar solvent for the non-polar compound, for example, an oil other than
the non-polar compound, for example, vitamin E oil or flax seed oil; a pH adjuster, for example, citric acid or phosphoric acid; one or more flavoring agents, for example, D-limonene or lemon oil; a co-surfactant, for example, a phospholipid (e.g.,
phosphatidylcholine).
<br/><br/> The appropriate concentration ranges for the additional ingredients are described in individual sections below.  Typically, the concentration of the additional ingredients depends, in part, on the concentrations of the non-polar active
ingredient, the surfactant and the polar solvent.  Typically, the concentrations of these three ingredients (surfactant, polar solvent and non-polar compound) are the focus of the formulating methods.  For example, when it is determined that
modifications to ingredient concentrations in the initial concentrate should be made, it typically is the concentrations of one or more of these three ingredients that are adjusted.
<br/><br/> In one example, it can be desirable to add one or more of the additional ingredients after evaluation of the initial concentrate, for example, in order to improve the concentrate with respect to one or more desired properties.
<br/><br/> ii.  Evaluation of the Initial Concentrate
<br/><br/> The formulation methods further include analysis of the initial concentrate based on one or more desired properties, for example, properties of an aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the diluted concentrate, for example, clarity,
color, smell, taste, safety, stability, "ringing" or forming of precipitates and/or the presence of crystals.  For example, the methods typically include analyzing the ability of the initial concentrate to form a clear liquid upon dilution in an aqueous
medium, such as by analysis of the clarity/turbidity of the resulting aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the initial concentrate.
<br/><br/> For evaluation of properties of the aqueous liquid dilution composition, the initial concentrate is diluted into an aqueous medium, typically water or another polar solvent, for example, at a dilution factor of between 1:10 or about 1:10 and at
most 1:1000 or about 1:1000, typically between 1:10 or about 1:10 and 1:500 or about 1:500, for example, at a dilution between 1:10 or about 1:10 and up to 1:250 or about 1:250, for example, diluted between 1:10 or about 1:10, 1:20 or about 1:20, 1:25 or
about 1:25, 1:50 or about 1:50, 1:100 or about 1:100, 1:200 or about 1:200, 1:250 or about 1:250, or up to 1:500 or about 1:500, for example, 1:10, 1:20, 1:25, 1:30, 1:35, 1:40, 1:50, 1:55, 1:60, 1:65, 1:70, 1:75, 1:80, 1:85, 1:90, 1:95, 1:100, 1:110,
1:120, 1:130, 1:140, 1:150, 1:160, 1:170, 1:180, 1:190, 1:200, 1:210, 1:220, 1:230, 1:240, 1:250, 1:260, 1:270, 1:280, 1:290, 1:300, 1:350, 1:400, 1:500, or any other dilution, such as others provided herein.  Typically, clarity of the aqueous liquid
dilution composition containing the diluted initial concentrate is evaluated using one or more approaches.  Additionally, other properties can be evaluated, for example, smell and/or taste properties of the liquid, for example, when the non-polar
compound is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), particularly fish oil or algae oil, whether the aqueous liquid dilution composition smells "fishy" can be evaluated empirically.
<br/><br/> (1) Clarity
<br/><br/> In one example, dilution of the provided concentrates in aqueous media yields clear liquids.  The clarity of the aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the initial concentrate can be evaluated by one or more of a plurality of approaches,
such as by empirical observation, by measuring particle size and/or by measuring the turbidity value of the liquid.
<br/><br/> In one example, the concentrates can be diluted to form clear liquids (or liquids that are equal in clarity to known liquids), by adding between 0.05 grams (g) or about 0.05 g and 10 g or about 10 g of the concentrate, typically between 0.05 g
and 5 g, for example, 0.05 g, 0.06 g, 0.07 g, 0.08 g, 0.09 g, 0.1 g, 0.2 g, 0.3 g, 0.4 g, 0.5 g, 0.6 g, 0.7 g, 0.8 g, 0.9 g, 1 g, 2 g, 3 g, 4 g, 5 g, 6 g, 7 g, 8 g, 9 g, or 10 g of the concentrate, to 8 fluid ounces, about 8 fluid ounces, or at least 8
fluid ounces or at least about 8 fluid ounces, for example 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100, 200 or more fluid ounces, of aqueous medium, for example, water, forming a clear aqueous liquid dilution composition
that contains the non-polar compound.  In another example, the concentrates can be diluted to form clear aqueous liquid dilution compositions by adding between 1 mL or about 1 mL and 10 mL or about 10 mL of the concentrate, for example, 1 mL, 2 mL, 3 mL,
4 mL, 5 mL, 6 mL, 7 mL, 8 mL, 9 mL or 10 mL of the concentrate to 8 fluid ounces, about 8 fluid ounces, or at least 8 fluid ounces or at least about 8 fluid ounces, for example 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50,
100, 200 or more fluid ounces, of aqueous medium, for example, water, forming a clear aqueous liquid dilution composition that contains the non-polar compound.
<br/><br/> In another example, the concentrate can be diluted in aqueous medium to form a clear aqueous liquid dilution composition when at least 25 mg or about 25 mg, typically at least 35 mg, for example, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90,
95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, 475, 500, 550, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1500, 2000 mg, or more, of the non-polar active ingredient, is contained
in at least 8 fluid ounces or at least about 8 fluid ounces of aqueous liquid dilution composition, for example, a beverage, for example, water.
<br/><br/> In another example, the concentrate can be diluted in an aqueous medium to form a clear aqueous liquid dilution composition at a dilution factor of between 1:10 or about 1:10 and at most 1:1000 or about 1:1000, typically between 1:10 or about
1:10 and 1:500 or about 1:500, for example, at a dilution between 1:10 or about 1:10 and up to 1:250 or about 1:250, for example, diluted between 1:10 or about 1:10, 1:20 or about 1:20, 1:25 or about 1:25, 1:50 or about 1:50, 1:100 or about 1:100, 1:200
or about 1:200, 1:250 or about 1:250, or up to 1:500 or about 1:500, for example, 1:10, 1:20, 1:25, 1:30, 1:35, 1:40, 1:50, 1:55, 1:60, 1:65, 1:70, 1:75, 1:80, 1:85, 1:90, 1:95, 1:100, 1:110, 1:120, 1:130, 1:140, 1:150, 1:160, 1:170, 1:180, 1:190, 1:200,
1:210, 1:220, 1:230, 1:240, 1:250, 1:260, 1:270, 1:280, 1:290, 1:300, 1:350, 1:400 or at most 1:500.  In another example, the clear liquid is formed at dilutions less dilute than 1:10 of the concentrate.
<br/><br/> The provided liquid nanoemulsion concentrates can be formulated using any non-polar compound for dilution in an aqueous medium.  In one example, the concentrates can be diluted in aqueous medium, for example, over a wide dilution range to form
clear liquids, for example, at a dilution factor of between 1:10 or about 1:10 and at most 1:500 or about 1:500, typically between 1:10 or about 1:10 and at most 1:1000 or about 1:1000, typically between 1:10 or about 1:10 and 1:500 or about 1:500, for
example, at a dilution between 1:10 or about 1:10 and up to 1:250 or about 1:250, for example, diluted between 1:10 or about 1:10, 1:20 or about 1:20, 1:25 or about 1:25, 1:50 or about 1:50, 1:100 or about 1:100, 1:200 or about 1:200, 1:250 or about
1:250, or up to 1:500 or about 1:500, for example, 1:10, 1:20, 1:25, 1:30, 1:35, 1:40, 1:50, 1:55, 1:60, 1:65, 1:70, 1:75, 1:80, 1:85, 1:90, 1:95, 1:100, 1:110, 1:120, 1:130, 1:140, 1:150, 1:160, 1:170, 1:180, 1:190, 1:200, 1:210, 1:220, 1:230, 1:240,
1:250, 1:260, 1:270, 1:280, 1:290, 1:300, 1:350, 1:400 or at most 1:500.
<br/><br/> Clarity of the aqueous liquid dilution composition can be evaluated using one or more of a plurality of approaches, for example, quantitatively, for example, by measuring particle size and/or by measuring the turbidity value of the liquid, or
qualitatively, by empirical evaluation.  In one example, a particular quantitative or qualitative clarity value is desired.  In another example, it is desired that the aqueous liquid dilution composition is as clear as, less clear or more clear than
another liquid, for example, an aqueous liquid dilution composition made according to the provided methods or a beverage, for example, a beverage or other aqueous medium that does not contain the concentrate.  For example, an aqueous liquid dilution
composition, containing the liquid concentrate diluted in a beverage, can be as clear or about as clear as the same beverage, containing no concentrate.  The evaluation can be done qualitatively, for example by empirical observation, or qualitatively,
for example, by calculating particle size and/or turbidity value (NTU) for the liquid(s).
<br/><br/> (2) Empirical Evaluation
<br/><br/> The relative clarity/turbidity of the aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the diluted concentrate (e.g., initial concentrate) can be assessed qualitatively by observation.  In one example, a liquid is considered clear if it does not
have a cloudy appearance and/or if no particles are visible when looking at the liquid with the naked eye.  Clarity can be assessed empirically by comparison to other liquids, for example, water, fruit juice, soda and/or milk.  For example, it can be
desirable that the liquid is as clear or about as clear as water or another liquid, for example a beverage.  For example, it can be desirable that the liquid (containing the liquid concentrate diluted in an aqueous medium, for example, a beverage) is as
clear or about as clear as the aqueous medium not containing the liquid concentrate.  In a related example, it can be desired that there is no substantial difference, for example, no observable difference, between the aqueous liquid dilution composition
containing the concentrate and the aqueous medium without the concentrate.  A clear liquid is not necessarily colorless, for example, a yellow liquid that contains no visible particles or cloudiness can be considered clear.
<br/><br/> (3) Particle Size
<br/><br/> Alternatively, the clarity of the aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the diluted concentrate (e.g., initial concentrate) can be assessed by measuring the particle size of the liquid.  Methods for measuring particle size are known and
any method for measuring particle size that can measure particle sizes in the appropriate ranges as described below, can be used.
<br/><br/> Particle size can be analyzed by commercial services, for example, from Delta Analytical Instruments, Inc, such as using a light-scattering analyzer, for example, a dynamic light scattering analyzer, for example, the Horiba.RTM.  LB-550, which
can measure particle sizes within a range of 0.001 micron to 6 micron and uses a Fourier-Transform/Iterative Deconvolution technique for reporting data and can measure sample concentrations from ppm to 40% solids; the Horiba.RTM.  LA-920, which is a
laser light-scattering instrument having an He--Ne laser and a tungsten lamp and can determine particle sizes from 0.02 micron to 2000 micron using Mie Theory; or other analyzers available from Delta Analytical Instruments, Inc.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, the particle size can be measured microscopically, for example, by viewing the liquid under a microscope, for example, at 640.times.  magnification.  With this method, particle size can be quantified by comparing to a measuring
device, for example, a ruler, which is visible when viewing the liquid under the microscope.  If any particles are observable at this magnification, they are measured by comparison to the measuring device.  At a magnification of 640.times., for example,
any particle that is about 25 nm, 25 nm, or greater than 25 nm are visible, while particle sizes smaller than 25 nm typically are not visible.
<br/><br/> Typically, it is desired that the aqueous liquid dilution compositions have a particle size less than 200 nm or less than about 200 nm, for example, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,
33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or 200 nm.  Typically, it is desired that the aqueous liquid dilution compositions have a particle size less than
100 nm or about 100 nm, less than 50 nm or about 50 nm, or less than 25 nm or about 25 nm.  Typically, the particle size of the aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the concentrate is between 5 nm or about 5 nm and 200 nm or about 200 nm,
typically between 5 nm or about 5 nm and 50 nm or about 50 nm.
<br/><br/> (4) Turbidity Measurement
<br/><br/> Alternatively, clarity of the liquid can be analyzed by taking an optical turbidity measurements, which indicates the level of cloudiness or haziness of a liquid, which correlates to size/number of particles in suspension in the liquid.  The
more clear a particular liquid, the lower its turbidity value.
<br/><br/> Turbidity can measured optically, for example, by using a nephelometer, an instrument with a light and a detector.  The nephelometer measures turbidity by detecting scattered light resulting from exposure of the liquid to an incident light.  The
amount of scattered light correlates to the amount of particulate matter in the liquid.  For example, a beam of light will pass through a sample with low turbidity with little disturbance.  Other methods for measuring turbidity are well known and can be
used with the provided methods and compositions.
<br/><br/> The units of a turbidity value measured with a nephelometer are Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU).  In one example, it is desired that the aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the diluted concentrate has low turbidity, for example, a
turbidity value (NTU) of 30 or about 30; or an NTU value of less than 30 or about 30, for example, less than 29 or about 29, less than 28 or about 28, less than 27 or about 27, less than 26 or about 26, less than 25 or about 25, less than 24 or about 24,
less than 23 or about 23, less than 22 or about 22, less than 21 or about 21, less than 20 or about 20, less than 19 or about 19, less than 18 or about 18, less than 17 or about 17, less than 16 or about 16, less than 15 or about 15, less than 14 or
about 14, less than 13 or about 13, less than 12 or about 12, less than 11 or about 11, less than 10 or about 10, less than 9 or about 9, less than 8 or about 8, less than 7 or about 7, less than 6 or about 6, less than 5 or about 5, less than 4 or about
4, less than 3 or about 3, less than 2 or about 2, less than 1 or about 1; or 29 or about 29, 28 or about 28, 27 or about 27, 26 or about 26, 25 or about 25, 24 or about 24, 23 or about 23, 22 or about 22, 21 or about 21, 20 or about 20, 19 or about 19,
18 or about 18, 17 or about 17, 16 or about 16, 15 or about 15, 14 or about 14, 13 or about 13, 12 or about 12, 11 or about 11, 10 or about 10, 9 or about 9, 8 or about 8, 7 or about 7, 6 or about 6, 5 or about 5, 4 or about 4, 3 or about 3, 2 or about
2, 1 or about 1, or 0 or about 0.  In another example, the turbidity value of the aqueous liquid dilution composition is less than 200 or less than about 200, for example, 200, 175, 150, 100, 50, 25 or less.
<br/><br/> In another example, it is desirable that the aqueous liquid dilution composition contains a turbidity value that is comparable, for example, about the same as, the same as, or less than or greater than, the turbidity value of another liquid, for
example, a beverage not containing the liquid concentrate or an aqueous liquid dilution composition made by the provided methods.
<br/><br/> iii.  Selecting a Formulation and Modifying Formulations
<br/><br/> After evaluation of the initial concentrate(s), either a particular formula is chosen or one or more modifications is made to the initial concentrate formula based on the results of the evaluation.  When an initial concentrate does not display
one or more desired properties, e.g., to the desired extent, based on the evaluation, the concentration of one or more ingredients can be adjusted and another initial concentrate made, in order to repeat the process until a concentrate with the desired
properties is made.  For modification of the initial concentrate, the amount of the polar solvent, surfactant and/or non-polar active ingredient can be adjusted, e.g., to another concentration within the appropriate concentration range.  Alternative
ingredients also can be chosen.  In one example, modification of the initial concentrate involves the addition of one or more additional ingredients.  For example, if evaluation reveals that the oil and water phases of the concentrate or aqueous liquid
dilution composition containing the diluted concentrate are separating, an emulsion stabilizer can be added to the formulation.  In another example, a co-surfactant can be added to help emulsify the components of the concentrate.  In another example, the
phase (oil phase or water phase), to which a particular ingredient is added, is modified.  For example, the formulation can be modified to change whether the surfactant is added to the oil phase or the water phase.
<br/><br/> In one example, when evaluation of the initial concentrate reveals that it has desired properties, no modifications are made.  In this example, the formula of the initial concentrate is used for making the concentrate.  When two or more initial
concentrates are made, for example, with increasing concentrations of an ingredient, the formula of one of the initial concentrates can be chosen.  Which formula is chosen can be based on which formula has the most desirable property.  Alternatively,
desirable properties can be balanced with relative amounts of ingredients.  In one example, it is desirable to choose the formulation that uses the lowest or the highest concentration of a particular ingredient but still provides a concentrate that
yields a clear liquid upon dilution in an aqueous medium.  In one example, the desired formulation is the formulation that has the lowest concentration of the surfactant, while still providing a concentrate that yields a clear liquid upon dilution in an
aqueous medium.  In another example, the desired formulation is the formulation that has the highest concentration of the non-polar active ingredient, while still providing a concentrate that yields a clear liquid upon dilution into an aqueous medium. 
In another example, the formulation that yields the clearest liquid is desired.
<br/><br/> In another example, however, modifications are made to the formula even if the initial concentrate bears desired properties.  For example, upon determining that a particular concentrate formulation results in desired properties, it can be
desirable to modify the concentration of one or more ingredients to determine whether the same desired properties can be achieved if a higher or lower concentration of the ingredient(s) is used.  For example, it can be desirable to determine the lowest
concentration of surfactant that can be used, while still generating a concentrate with a desired property, for example, the ability to form a clear liquid upon dilution in an aqueous medium.  In another example, it can be desirable to determine the
highest concentration of the non-polar ingredient that can be incorporated into a concentrate, while still maintaining the desired property, for example, the ability of the concentrate to form a clear liquid upon dilution in an aqueous medium.  In
another example, one or more additional ingredients can be added after making an initial concentrate with desirable properties, for example, flavoring agents and/or pH adjusting agents.
<br/><br/> The following sections describe ingredients used in the provided liquid nanoemulsion concentrates.
<br/><br/> b. Non-Polar Compounds
<br/><br/> The concentrates contain one or more non-polar compounds.  Non-polar compounds include any lipophilic or lipid soluble compounds, for example, active ingredients, that have greater solubility in organic solvents (e.g., ethanol, methanol, ethyl
ether, acetone, and benzene) and in fats and oils, than in aqueous liquid dilution compositions, for example, water.  Typically, the non-polar compounds are poorly water soluble, for example, water insoluble or compounds having low water solubility.  The
non-polar compounds include, but are not limited to, drugs, hormones, vitamins, nutrients and other lipophilic compounds.  Exemplary non-polar compounds are listed herein below.  The provided methods and compositions can be used to dilute (e.g.,
dissolve/disperse) any non-polar compound in aqueous medium.  In one example, the non-polar compound differs from the surfactant, for example, is not a sucrose fatty acid ester.  In another example, the non-polar compound is not Vitamin E. Exemplary of

<br/><br/> Exemplary of the non-polar compounds contained in the concentrates are compounds containing fatty acids, for example, active ingredients containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).  Fatty acids are straight-chain hydrocarbon molecules with a
carboxyl (COOH) group at one end of the chain.  PUFAs are fatty acids that contain more than one carbon-carbon double bond in the carbon chain of the fatty acid.  PUFAs, particularly essential fatty acids, are useful as dietary supplements.
<br/><br/> Different nomenclatures can be used to describe fatty acid molecules.  Lipid nomenclature, for example, 18:3 .omega.-3, indicates the carbon chain length, number of double bonds and the position along the carbon chain of the first carbon-carbon
double bond in a fatty acid.  Using this nomenclature, each carbon along the chain is labeled according to its position relative to one end of the chain.  For example, the first carbon away from the carboxylate end is named .alpha., the second is named
.beta., and so forth.  The last carbon in the molecule (furthest from the carboxy group) always is labeled .omega.  (or omega, or n).  The number of carbons and the number of double bonds are listed first in the lipid name of a fatty acid, separated by a
colon.  For example, the name "18:3" indicates that the molecule has eighteen (18) carbons and three (3) double bonds.  Following these numbers, the position at which the first double bond appears, relative to the last (.omega.) carbon, is listed.  For
example, the nomenclature, 18:3 .omega.-3 (or 18:3 omega-3; or 18:3 n-3), describes a fatty acid with eighteen (18) carbons and three (3) double bonds, the first of which occurs at the third carbon away from the omega carbon.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, chemical nomenclature can be used.  The chemical name of a fatty acid describes the position of each double bond.  In the chemical naming, the carbons are numbered, beginning with 1, starting with the carbon that is part of the
carboxy (COOH) group.  Thus, with this numbering system, the .alpha.  carbon is labeled "2." The chemical name of the fatty acid lists the first carbon (from the COOH end) to participate in each double bond.
<br/><br/> Certain PUFAs are called essential fatty acids because mammals, including humans, cannot synthesize them using any known chemical pathway, and must obtain them from diet or by supplementation.  (U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,870,077; Covington, American
Family Physician (2004), 70(1): 133-140).  The essential PUFAs are the omega-3 (.omega.3; n-3) fatty acids and the omega-6 (.omega.-6; n-6) fatty acids.  Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are methylene interrupted polyenes, which have two or more cis
double bonds, separated by a single methylene group.  Exemplary of Omega-3 fatty acids are Alpha-Linolenic acid (.alpha.-Linolenic acid; ALA) (18:3.omega.3) (a short-chain fatty acid); Stearidonic acid (18:4.omega.3) (a short-chain fatty acid);
Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (20:5.omega.3); Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6.omega.3); Eicosatetraenoic acid (24:4.omega.3); Docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, Clupanodonic acid) (22:5.omega.3); 16:3 .omega.3; 24:5 .omega.3 and nisinic acid (24:6.omega.3). 
Longer chain Omega-3 fatty acids can be synthesized from ALA (the short-chain omega-3 fatty acid).  Exemplary of Omega-6 fatty acids are Linoleic acid (18:2.omega.6) (a short-chain fatty acid); Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) (18:3.omega.6); Dihomo gamma
linolenic acid (DGLA) (20:3.omega.6); Eicosadienoic acid (20:2.omega.6); Arachidonic acid (AA) (20:4.omega.6); Docosadienoic acid (22:2.omega.6); Adrenic acid (22:4.omega.6); and Docosapentaenoic acid (22:5.omega.6).
<br/><br/> While the longer chain Omega-3 and Omega-6 essential fatty acids can be synthesized from ALA (the short-chain omega-3 fatty acid) and Linolenic acid (LA), respectively, evidence suggests that conversion of these short chain fatty acids in humans
is slow.  Thus, a major source of long chain essential PUFAs is dietary (see e.g., Ross et al. (2007) Lipids in Health and Disease 6:21; Lands (1992) FASEB 6(8): 2530).  Dietary supplements containing PUFAs, particularly essential PUFAs, are desirable
for protection against cardiovascular disease, inflammation and mental illnesses (see e.g., Ross et al. (2007) Lipids in Health and Disease 6:21; Lands (1992) FASEB 6(8): 2530; U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,870,077).  Evidence suggests that essential fatty acids,
particularly EPA and DHA, in the form of food and nutritional supplements, play a role in preventing a number of disease states, including cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, mental health and behavioral diseases and disorders (see e.g., Ross et al.
(2007) Lipids in Health and Disease 6:21; Lands (1992) FASEB 6(8): 2530; U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,870,077; Covington (2004) American Family Physician 70(1): 133-140).
<br/><br/> Omega-9 fatty acids are non-essential PUFAs.  Exemplary of omega-9 fatty acids are Oleic acid (which is monounsaturated) (18:1 .omega.9); Eicosenoic acid (20:1 .omega.9); Mead acid (20:3 .omega.9); Erucic acid (22:1 .omega.9); and Nervonic acid
(24:1 .omega.9).
<br/><br/> Conjugated fatty acids are PUFAs with two or more conjugated double bonds.  Conjugated fatty acids can be used as nutritional supplements.  Exemplary of conjugated fatty acids are Conjugated Linoleic acid (CLA), for example, 18:2 .omega.7, 18:2
.omega.6; Conjugated Linolenic acid, for example, 18:3.omega.6, 18:3.omega.5; and other conjugated fatty acids, for example, 18:3 .omega.3, 18:4 .omega.3, and 20:5 .omega.6.
<br/><br/> (1) Omega-3 Fatty Acid Compounds
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the PUFA-containing active ingredients that can be used in the provided compositions are compounds that contain one or more omega-3 (.omega.3; n-3) fatty acids, for example, compounds containing DHA and/or EPA fatty acids, for
example, marine oils for example, fish oil, krill oil and algae oil; and compounds containing ALA fatty acids, for example, flax seed oil.
<br/><br/> Typically, oils and aqueous compositions containing long-chained polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are susceptible to oxidation, making them unstable and giving them an unpleasant taste.  The ingredients and relative concentrations thereof, as
well as the methods for making the concentrates, contribute to desirable properties of DHA/EPA-containing concentrates.  In one example, ingredients and methods minimize the "fishy" odor and/or taste of DHA/EPA compositions and increase their stability
over time.  In one aspect, the compounds in the concentrates have low oxidation, contributing to these desirable properties.
<br/><br/> (a) DHA/EPA
<br/><br/> Exemplary of non-polar active ingredients that contain one or more omega-3 fatty acids, which can be used in the provided compositions, are compounds containing DHA and/or EPA, for example, marine oil, for example, fish oil, krill oil and algae
oil.  Any oil containing DHA and/or EPA can be used.  In one example, the non-polar active ingredient contains between 20% or about 20% and 40% or about 40% DHA.  In another example, the non-polar active ingredient contains between 25% or about 25% and
35% or about 35% DHA.  In another example, the non-polar active ingredient contains at least 70% or about 70%, by weight (w/w), DHA, for example, at least 75% or about 75%, at least 80% or about 80%, at least 85% or about 85%, or at least 90% or about
90%, by weight (w/w), DHA.  In another example, the non-polar active ingredient contains between 5% or about 5% and 15% or about 15% EPA, for example, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15%, by weight (w/w), EPA.  In another example, the non-polar
active ingredient comprises not more than 10% or about 10% EPA or less than 10% or about 10%, EPA.  In another example, the non-polar active ingredient contains DHA and EPA, for example, DHA representing at least 20% or about 20%, by weight of the
non-polar active ingredient and EPA representing not more than 13% or about 13% of the non-polar active ingredient, for example, not more than 10% or about 10%, by weight of the non-polar active ingredient.  In another example, the non-polar active
ingredient contains DHA, representing at least 35% or about 35% of the non-polar active ingredient and EPA representing not more than 13% or about 13% of the non-polar active ingredient, for example, not more than 10% or about 10% of the non-polar active
ingredient.  In another example, the non-polar active ingredient contains DHA and EPA, for example, DHA representing at least 70% or about 70% of the non-polar active ingredient and EPA representing not more than 13% or about 13% of the non-polar active
ingredient, for example, not more than 10% or about 10% of the non-polar active ingredient.
<br/><br/> (i) Fish Oils
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the PUFA-containing non-polar active ingredients that can be used in the provided compositions are oils derived from fish, which contain DHA, EPA or DHA and EPA.  Particularly, cold water marine fish are a known source of Omega-3
fatty acids (U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,670,285).  Suitable fish oil containing DHA, EPA or DHA and EPA can be obtained from any of a number of commercial sources, for example, fish oils available from Jedwards International, Inc., any of which can be used with
the provided compositions.
<br/><br/> Fish oils typically are extracted from fish tissue, for example, frozen fish tissue.  In one example, the fish oil is a tasteless fish oil, for example, a cod liver oil, which has been isolated from fish, for example, from cod liver, and then
refined and deodorized, or in some other way treated so its taste becomes neutral, for example, as described in International Publication Nos.  WO 00/23545 and WO 2004/098311.  In one example, these fish oils are isolated from frozen fish tissue by a
process that minimizes oxidation.  Exemplary of such a tasteless fish oil is Denomega.TM.  100, Borregaard Ingredients, Sarpsborg, Norway; distributed by Denomega Nutritional Oils AS, Boulder, Colo.  Typically, the tasteless fish oil, for example, cod
liver oil, contains between 25% or about 25% and 35% or about 35% Omega-3 fatty acids, for example, 34% Omega-3 fatty acids.  In one example, the fish oil, for example, the Denomega.TM.  100 oil, contains 13% or about 13% DHA and 13% or about 13% EPA.
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of the fish oils that can be included in the provided compositions are fish oils containing high amounts of Omega-3 fatty acids, for example, high amounts of DHA.  One example of such a fish oil contains at least about 85% DHA,
typically greater than 85 DHA and at least about 90% Omega-3 fatty acids, typically greater than, 90% Omega-3 fatty acids.  In another example, the fish oil can contain 98% PUFA, 89% Omega-3 fatty acids, about 70% DHA, about 10% EPA, 8.9% Omega-6 fatty
acids and 0.7% Omega-9 fatty acids.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of a fish oil containing high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids that can used as the non-polar compound in the provided compositions is an Omega-3 Fish Oil EE (O3C Nutraceuticals, supplied by Jedwards International Inc., Quincy, Mass.),
which contains 89% Omega-3 fatty acids, 8.9% Omega-6 fatty acids, 0.7% Omega-9 fatty acids, 0.1% saturated fatty acids, 1.0% monounsaturated fatty acids, 74.5% Docosahexanoic (DHA) fatty acids, 9.3% Eicosapentaenoic (EPA) fatty acids and 98%

(20:4 .omega.3) arachidonic acid, 0.1% (22:1 .omega.11) erucic acid, 0.6% (21:5 .omega.3) uncosapentaenoic acid, 0.5% (22:4 .omega.6) docosatetraenoic acid, 5.4% (22:5 .omega.6) docosapentaenoic acid, 3.6% (22:5 .omega.3) docosapentaenoic acid and 0.9%
other fatty acids.
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of a fish oil containing high amounts of Omega-3 fatty acids that can be used in the provided compositions is Omega Concentrate 85 DHA TG Ultra (O3C Nutraceuticals AS, Oslo, Norway), which contains greater than 85% DHA (C22:6n-3)
and greater than 90% total omega-3 fatty acids and is isolated from fatty fish species Eugraulidae, Clupeidae and Scombridae families.  This fish oil is produced by purifying and concentrating the oils from these fish with gentle technologies to increase
the concentration of omega-3 fatty acid DHA.  Any fish oil containing DHA and/or EPA can be used as the non-polar compound in the provided compositions.  Also exemplary of the fish oils are other fish oils made by O3C Nutraceuticals, AS and other fish
oils supplied by Jedwards, International, Inc.
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of the fish oils are krill oils, made according to International Publication No. WO 2007/080515.
<br/><br/> (ii) Algae Oil
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of non-polar compounds containing Omega-3 PUFAs, particularly DHA (and optionally EPA), that can be used as the non-polar compound in the provided compositions are oils derived from microorganisms, for example, oils derived from
marine dinoflagellates, for example, microalgae, for example, Crypthecodinium sp, particularly, Crypthecodinium cohnii.  Microalgae oils, like fish oil, are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA (see e.g., U.S.  Patent Nos. 
5,397,591, 5,407,957, 5,492,938 and 5,711,983).  Exemplary of oils derived from microalgae are the oils disclosed in, and oils made according to the methods described in, U.S.  Patent Nos.  5,397,591, 5,407,957, 5,492,938 and 5,711,983 and U.S. 
Publication number 2007/0166411, including DHASCO.RTM.  and DHASCO-S.RTM.  (Martek Biosciences Corporation).
<br/><br/> For example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,397,591 describes, inter alia, single cell edible oils (algae oils) (and methods for making the oils), which contain at least 70% triglycerides, which contain about 20-35% DHA and lack EPA, isolated from
Crypthecodinium cohnii, preferably containing more than 70% triglycerides, having 15-20% myristic acid; 20-25% palmitic acid; 10-15% oleic acid; 30-40% DHA and 0-10% other triglycerides.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,407,957 describes, inter alia, algae oils (and
methods for making the oils) derived from Crypthecodinium cohnii, preferably containing greater than about 90% triglycerides, at least 35 DHA by weight (w/w), in one example, having 15-20% myristic acid, 20-25% palmitic acid, 10-15% oleic acid, 40-45%
DHA, and 0-5% other oils.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,492,938 describes, inter alia, single cell edible oils (and methods for making the oils) containing at least 70% triglycerides, which contain about 20-35% DHA and lack EPA, isolated from Crypthecodinium
cohnii, in one example, containing more than 70% triglycerides, having 15-20% myristic acid; 20-25% palmitic acid; 10-15% oleic acid; 30-40% DHA; 0-10% other triglycerides.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,711,983 describes, inter alia, single cell edible oils (and
methods for making the oils) containing at least 70% triglycerides, which contain about 20-35% DHA and lack EPA, isolated from Crypthecodinium cohnii, in one example, containing more than 70% triglycerides, having 15-20% myristic acid; 20-25% palmitic
acid; 10-15% oleic acid; 30-40% DHA and 0-10% other triglycerides.
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of suitable microalgae oils are those disclosed, for example, in U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,977,166 and U.S.  Publication Number US 2004/0072330.  Any oil derived from dinoflagellate, for example, microalgae, which contains DHA, and
optionally EPA, is suitable as an algae oil for use with the provided compositions, for example, V-Pure algae oil (Water4Life, Switzerland, which contains EPA and DHA.
<br/><br/> (b) Flax Seed Oil--Omega 3 (ALA)
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of the Omega-3 containing non-polar compounds used in the provided compositions is flaxseed oil (flaxseed oil, linseed oil).  Flaxseed oils, which are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid, have
been used as nutritional supplements.  Flaxseed oils are produced by pressing the flax seed and refining the oil from the flax seeds.  Exemplary of flaxseed oil that can be used as the non-polar compound in the provided compositions is flaxseed oil
derived from Linum usitatissimum L., for example, flaxseed oil supplied by Sanmark LLC, Greensboro, N.C.  (Sanmark Limited, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China), which contains not less than (NLT) 50% C18:3 alpha-linolenic acid, and further contains other
fatty acids, for example, 3-8% C16:0 Palmitic acid, 2-8% C18:0 Stearic acid, 11-24% C18:1 Oleic acid, 11-24% C18:2 linoleic acid and 0-3% other fatty acids.  Also exemplary of suitable flaxseed oil is a flaxseed oil containing 6% Palmitic acid, 2.5%
stearic acid, 0.5% arachidic acid, 19% oleic acid, 24.1% linoleic acid, 47.4% linolenic acid, and 0.5% other fatty acids.  The fatty acid composition of flaxseed oil can vary.  Any flaxseed oil can be used as the non-polar compound in the provided
compositions.  In one example, the flaxseed oil contains at least 50% alpha-linolenic acid or at least about 50% alpha-linolenic acid.  In another example, the flaxseed oil contains at least 65% or about 65% or 70% or about 70% alpha-linolenic acid. 
Exemplary of a flaxseed containing greater than 65% linolenic acid content (of total fatty acid content), for example, 70-80% or 70-75%, is the flaxseed described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,870,077.
<br/><br/> (2) Omega-6 Compounds
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of the non-polar compounds used in the provided compositions are compounds containing omega-6 PUFAs, for example, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), for example, borage oil and evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) oil, blackcurrant seed
oil, hemp seed oil, fungal oil and spirulina extract.  Any oil containing omega-6 fatty acids can be used in the provided compositions.
<br/><br/> (a) Borage Oil (Gamma-Linolenic Acid (GLA))
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the omega-6 containing non-polar compounds are compounds containing GLA, for example, borage oil.  GLA is an omega-6 PUFA, which primarily is derived from vegetable oils, for example, evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) oil,
blackcurrant seed oil, hemp seed oil, and spirulina extract.  GLA has been used as a nutritional supplement.  It has been proposed that GLA has a role in treating various chronic diseases and in particular that it has anti-inflammatory effects (Fan and
Chapkin The Journal of Nutrition (1998), 1411-1414).  In one example, the non-polar active ingredient contains at least about 22% or about 22%, by weight (w/w), GLA, for example, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
50, 60%, or more, by weight (w/w), GLA.
<br/><br/> Borage (Borago officinalis), also known as "starflower" is an herb with seeds containing high amounts of GLA.  Exemplary of borage oil that is used as a non-polar active ingredient in the provided compositions is the borage oil supplied by
Sanmark LLC, Greensboro, N.C.  (Sanmark Limited, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China), derived by pressing and isolating oil from the seeds of Borago officinalis L. This oil contains not less than (NLT) 22% C18:3 gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), between 9 and
12% C16:0 Palmitic acid, between 3% and 5% C18:0 Stearic acid, between 15% and 20% C18:1 Oleic acid, between 35% and 42% C18:2 linoleic acid, between 3% and 5% C20:1 Ocosenoic acid, between 1% and 4% C22:1 Docosenoic acid and between 0% and 4% other

<br/><br/> (3) Saw Palmetto Extract
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of the non-polar compounds used in the provided compositions is saw palmetto extract, a lipophilic extract of the ripe berries of the American dwarf palm (also called Serenoa repens or Sabal serrulata), which has been used to
treat genitourinary and other diseases and to enhance sperm production, breast size and libido, as a mild diuretic, a nerve sedative, an expectorant and a digestive tract tonic, and particularly to treat benign prostate hyperplasia (BHP) (Ernst, Academia
and Clinic (2002), 136; 42-53; Gordon and Shaughnessy, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2003), 76(6); 1281-1283).  Saw palmetto extract is commercially available from a number of sources.  Any saw palmetto lipid extract can be used in the provided
compositions.  Exemplary of the saw palmetto extract that can be used in the provided compositions is Saw Palmetto, Lipophilic Extract, commercially available from Natural Medicinals, Inc., Felda, Fla.  This Saw Palmetto Lipophilic Extract is Carbon
Dioxide extracted and, in one example, contains, 85.9% total fatty acids, including 0.8% Caproic acid, 2% Caprylic acid, 2.4% Capric acid, 27.1 Lauric acid, 10.3 Myristic acid, 8.1% Palmitic acid, 0.2% Palmitoleic acid, 2% Stearic acid, 26.7 Oleic acid,

<br/><br/> (4) Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA)
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of the PUFA non-polar compounds that can be used in the provided compositions are non-polar compounds containing conjugated fatty acids.  Conjugated fatty acids are PUFAs with two or more conjugated double bonds.  Conjugated fatty
acids can be used as nutritional supplements.  Exemplary of the active ingredients containing conjugated fatty acids are compounds containing Conjugated Linoleic acid (CLA), for example, 18:2 .omega.7, 18:2 .omega.6; Conjugated Linolenic acid, for
example, 18:3.omega.6, 18:3.omega.5; and other conjugated fatty acids, for example, 18:3 .omega.3, 18:4 .omega.3, and 20:5 .omega.6.  CLA refers to a family of linoleic acid isomers found primarily in meat and dairy products of ruminants.  Typically, the
CLA compounds contain a mixture of different CLA isomers, for example, C18:2 CLA c9,t11, CLA t10, c12 and other CLA isomers.  Exemplary of the CLA that can be used as an active ingredient in the provided compositions is CLA (80%) commercially available
from Sanmark, LTD (Dalian, Liaoning Province, China; product code 01057-A80).  This CLA is clear white to pale yellow oil and has the following fatty acid composition: NMT (not more than) 9.0% C16:0 Palmitic acid, NMT 4.0% Stearic acid, NMT 15.0% C18:1
Oleic acid, NMT 3.0% C18:2 Linoleic acid, NLT (not less than) 80% C18:2 CLA (including the following isomers: NLT 37.5% C18:2 CLA c9,t11, 37.5% C18:2 CLA t10, c12, and NMT 5.0% other CLA isomers); and NMT 5.0% other fatty acids.  Other CLA containing
compounds can be used.
<br/><br/> ii.  Coenzyme Q Active Ingredients
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the non-polar active ingredients are compounds containing Coenzyme Q, for example, Coenzyme Q10 (also called CoQ10, ubiquinone, ubidecarenone, ubiquinol and vitamin Q10).  Coenzyme Q compounds are benzoquinone compounds containing
isoprenyl units.  The number of isoprenyl units in each of the different CoQ species is indicated with a number following CoQ.  For example, CoQ10 contains 10 isoprenyl units.  Coenzyme Q10 is a predominant Coenzyme Q species.
<br/><br/> Coenzyme Q can exist in two different forms: an oxidized form and a reduced form.  When the oxidized form of a Coenzyme Q species is reduced by one equivalent, it becomes a ubisemiquinone, denoted QH, which contains a free radical on one of the
oxygens in the benzene ring of the benzoquinone.  Oxidized and reduced coenzyme Q containing compounds can be used as active ingredients in the provided compositions.
<br/><br/> (1) Coenzyme Q10
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the Coenzyme Q containing non-polar active ingredients that can be used in the provided compositions are active ingredients containing Coenzyme Q10.  Coenzyme Q10 (also called CoQ10, ubiquinone, ubidecarenone, ubiquinol, and vitamin
Q10) is a benzoquinone compound that contains 10 isoprenoid units.  The "Q" in the name refers to Quinone and the 10 refers to the number of isoprenoid units.  CoQ10 typically refers to the oxidized form of CoQ10, which also is referred to as
ubidecarenone, as opposed to the reduced form of CoQ10.  In both, the reduced and oxidized CoQ10 are exemplary of the coenzyme Q species that can be used as active ingredients in the provided compositions.
<br/><br/> CoQ10 has electron-transfer ability and is present in cellular membranes, such as those of the endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, lysosomes, vesicles and the mitochondria.  A decrease in natural CoQ10 synthesis has been observed in sick and
elderly people.  Because of this observation and its potent antioxidant properties, CoQ10 is used as a dietary supplement and a treatment for diseases such as cancer and heart disease.  CoQ10, however, exhibits relatively poor bioavailability.
<br/><br/> CoQ10 containing compounds are available commercially.  Any CoQ10 compound or reduced CoQ10 compound can be used with the provided composition.  Exemplary of the CoQ10 compounds that can be used as active ingredients are coenzyme Q10 compounds
containing greater than 98% or greater than about 98% ubidecarenone, for example, the compound sold under the name Kaneka Q1.TM.  (USP Ubidecarenone) by Kaneka Nutrients, L.P., Pasadena, Tex.  The compound sold under the name Kaneka Q10.TM.  is fermented
entirely from yeast and is identical to the body's own CoQ10 and free from the cis isomer found in some synthetically produced CoQ10 compounds.  Any CoQ10 compound can be used in the provided compositions.
<br/><br/> iii.  Phytosterol-Containing Active Ingredients
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the non-polar compounds used as active ingredients in the provided compositions are phytosterol (plant sterol)-containing compounds.  Plant sterols are structurally similar to cholesterol and have been found to reduce the absorption
of dietary cholesterol, which can affect the levels of serum cholesterol.  According to the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA), two servings per day, each containing 0.4 grams of plant sterols, for a total daily intake of at least 0.8 grams, as
part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease.  Thus, plant sterols are used in nutritional supplements.
<br/><br/> Any phytosterol-containing compound can be used as an active ingredient in the provided compositions.  Exemplary of the phytosterol-containing compounds that can be used as active ingredients in the provided compositions are compounds containing
plant sterols, for example, the compound sold under the name CardioAid.TM., distributed by B&amp;D Nutrition and manufactured by ADM Natural Health and Nutrition, Decatur, Ill.  This compound contains Kosher, Pareve, and Halal plant sterols that are produced
under current food GMPs.  The sterols are PCR negative and the material is derived from genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  This phytosterol compound contains a minimum of 95% plant sterols, which can include up to 5 plant sterols.  The compound can
contain, for example, 40-58% Beta sitosterol, 20-30% Campesterol, 14-22% Stigmasterol, 0-6% Brassicasterol and 0-5% Sitostanol.  The compound further can contain tocopherols, for example, 0-15 mg/g tocopherols.  The compound is tested and is negative for
microorganisms, such as Salmonella, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
<br/><br/> c. Surfactants
<br/><br/> The provided compositions contain surfactants.  For example, in addition to the non-polar compound(s), the liquid concentrates contain one or more surfactants.  In the provided methods for producing the concentrates, the surfactant is added to
the water phase, the oil phase, or to the water and the oil phase.  The compositions further can contain one or more co-surfactants or emulsifiers.  Typically, the surfactants are natural surfactants, for example, a surfactant that is G.R.A.S. 
(generally recognized as safe) by the FDA and/or Kosher certified.
<br/><br/> The surfactants aggregate in aqueous liquids, such as in the provided compositions (e.g., concentrates and aqueous liquid dilution compositions) to form micelles, which contain the non-polar compound(s).  The hydrophilic portion(s) of the
surfactant molecules are oriented toward the outside of the micelle, in contact with the aqueous medium, while the hydrophobic portion(s) of the surfactant molecules are oriented toward the center of the micelle, in contact with the non-polar
compound(s), which is contained in the center of the micelle.  The micelles can contain more than one surfactant and/or co-surfactant.  Properties of the provided compositions, for example, the particle size of the compositions and desirable properties
related to the particle size, are influenced by the choice of surfactant(s) and the relative amount (concentration) of surfactant.  For example, the HLB of the surfactant(s) can affect particle size, clarity, taste, smell, crystal formation and other
properties of the provided compositions.  Similarly, the concentration of the surfactant compared with the concentration(s) of other ingredients, particularly compared with the concentration of the polar solvent(s) and the concentration of the non-polar
compound(s), can affect various desirable properties, for example, the ability to disperse or dissolve in aqueous media, e.g., to form a clear aqueous liquid dilution composition or pleasant taste and/or smell.
<br/><br/> Surfactants (and co-surfactants) are molecules that contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions.  In one example, the hydrophobic portion is a hydrophobic tail and the hydrophilic portion is a hydrophilic head of the surfactant molecule.
<br/><br/> The HLB value of a surfactant is derived from a semi-empirical formula; HLB values are used to index surfactants according to their relative hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity.  An HLB value is a numerical representation of the relative
representation of hydrophilic groups and hydrophobic groups in a surfactant or mixture of surfactants.  The weight percent of these respective groups indicates properties of the molecular structure.  See, for example, Griffin, W. C. Soc.  Cos.  Chem.
1:311 (1949).
<br/><br/> Surfactant HLB values range from 1-45, while the range for non-ionic surfactants typically is from 1-20.  The more lipophilic a surfactant is, the lower its HLB value.  Conversely, the more hydrophilic a surfactant is, the higher its HLB value. 
Lipophilic surfactants have greater solubility in oil and lipophilic substances, while hydrophilic surfactants dissolve more easily in aqueous liquids.  In general, surfactants with HLB values greater than 10 or greater than about 10 are called
"hydrophilic surfactants," while surfactants having HLB values less than 10 or less than about 10 are referred to as "hydrophobic surfactants." HLB values are known for a number of surfactants Tables 1A and 1B list HLB values of exemplary surfactants and
co-surfactants.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of surfactants that can be used in the provided methods and compositions are surfactants having an HLB value of between 14 or about 14 and 20 or about 20, typically between 16 or about 16 and 18 or about 18, for example, 14 or about
14, 15 or about 15, 16 or about 16, 17 or about 17, 18 or about 18, 19 or about 19, or 20 or about 20.
<br/><br/> The surfactants typically are, and typically have an HLB value between at or about 14 and at or about 20.  Particular examples of suitable surfactants for use in the provided compositions include non-ionic surfactants, such as sugar derived
surfactants, including fatty acid esters of sugars and sugar derivatives.  For examples, sugar fatty acid esters include fatty acid esters of sucrose, glucose, maltose and other sugars, esterified to fatty acids of varying lengths (e.g., varying numbers
of carbons).  The fatty acids typically have carbon chains between 8 and 28 carbons in length, and typically between 8 and 20, or between 8 and 18 or between 12 and 18, such as, but not limited to, stearic acid (18 carbons), oleic acid (18 carbons),
palmitic acid (16 carbons), myristic acid (14 carbons) and lauric acid (12 carbons).  Typically, the sugar ester surfactants are sucrose ester surfactants, typically sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants.
<br/><br/> (1) Sucrose Fatty Acid Ester Surfactants
<br/><br/> Sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants contain one or more sucrose fatty acid esters, which are non-ionic surfactants that contain sucrose in the hydrophilic portions and fatty acids in the hydrophobic portions.  The sucrose fatty acid esters can
be made by well-known methods (see, for example, U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  3,480,616, 3,644,333, 3,714,144, 4,710,567, 4,898,935, 4,996,309, 4,995,911, 5,011,922 and 5,017,697 and International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2007/082149), typically in an
esterification reaction as described below.
<br/><br/> Because sucrose contains eight hydroxy (OH) groups, the esterification reaction can join the sucrose molecule to one fatty acid molecule, or can join it to a plurality of, fatty acid molecules, producing different degrees of esterification,
e.g., mono-, di-, tri- and poly- (up to octa-) fatty acid esters, but primarily mono-, di-, and/or tri-esters.  The degree of esterification can depend on conditions of esterification.  The esterification reaction can be carried out with a single type of
fatty acid, or a plurality of fatty acids, such as fatty acids with varying carbon chain lengths, branched and linear fatty acids, and/or saturated or unsaturated fatty acids.  The esterification reaction with a single fatty acid can produce a single
ester, and typically forms more than one ester, such as mono- di-, tri- and/or poly-esters, formed from one reaction.  The relative amounts of mono- di- tri- and/or poly-esters can depend on reaction conditions.
<br/><br/> The fatty acid in the sucrose fatty acid ester can be any fatty acid, and can contain between 4 and 28 carbon atoms, typically between 8 and 28 carbon atoms, and typically between 8 and 25 carbon atoms, such as between 8 and 18 carbon atoms,
such as 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 carbon atoms.  The fatty acid can be synthetic or naturally occurring, and include linear and branched fatty acids.  The fatty acids include, but are not limited to, myristic acid, palmitic acid,
stearic acid, oleic acid, caproic acid, capric acid, myristic acid, decanoic acid and pelargonic acid.
<br/><br/> Thus, the sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants include sucrose monoesters, diesters, triesters and polyesters, and mixtures thereof, and typically contain sucrose monoesters.  The sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants include single fatty acid
esters and also include homogeneous mixtures of sucrose esters, containing members with different lengths of fatty acid carbon chain and/or members with different degrees of esterification.  For example, the sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants include
mixtures of monoesters, diesters, triesters, and/or polyesters.  The sugar ester surfactants further include sucrose fatty acid ester analogs and homologs and mixtures thereof.
<br/><br/> Sucrose fatty acid esters are compounds having the following formula shown in Scheme I below.
<br/><br/> ##STR00010##
<br/><br/> where each of X.sup.1, X.sup.2, X.sup.3, X.sup.4, X.sup.5, X.sup.6, X.sup.7 and X.sup.8 independently is:
<br/><br/> a hydroxyl (--OH) group, or
<br/><br/> ##STR00011## where:
<br/><br/> each R is an alkyl group having 3-27 carbon atoms; and
<br/><br/> when more than one of X.sup.1, X.sup.2, X.sup.3, X.sup.4, X.sup.5, X.sup.6, X.sup.7 and X.sup.8 is
<br/><br/> ##STR00012##
<br/><br/> each R can be a different alkyl group (e.g., having different number of carbon atoms and/or different saturation), or can be the same alkyl group.
<br/><br/> Typically, in the provided sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants, each R has between 7 and 27 carbon atoms, and typically between 7 and 19 atoms, such as 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19 carbon atoms or between 7 and 17 carbon
atoms:
<br/><br/> An alkyl group can be a straight chain or branched alkyl group, can be substituted or unsubstituted, and can be a saturated "saturated alkyl group," meaning that it does not contain any alkene or alkyne groups; or an "unsaturated alkyl group,"
meaning that it contains at least one alkene or alkyne group.  An alkyl group that includes at least one carbon-carbon double bond (C.dbd.C) also is referred to by the term "alkenyl," and alkenyl groups optionally can be substituted.  An alkyl group that
includes at least one carbon-carbon triple bond (C.ident.C) also is referred to by the term "alkynyl," and alkynyl groups optionally can be substituted.
<br/><br/> Typically, the sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants contain sucrose fatty acid monoesters, having the structure set forth in Scheme V, where one of X.sup.1, X.sup.2, X.sup.3, X.sup.4, X.sup.5, X.sup.6, X.sup.7 and X.sup.8 (typically X.sup.1) is
<br/><br/> ##STR00013##
<br/><br/> and the other seven of X.sup.1, X.sup.2, X.sup.3, X.sup.4, X.sup.5, X.sup.6, X.sup.7 and X.sup.8 are each, independently, --OH.  An exemplary monoester has the following structure:
<br/><br/> ##STR00014## where R is an alkyl group having 3-27 carbons, and typically 7-27 carbons.
<br/><br/> The sucrose fatty acid esters include blends of sucrose fatty acid esters, which typically include monoesters, and can also include diesters, triesters and polyesters, which have structures according to Scheme V, above, where two (diesters),
three (triesters) or more (polyesters) of X.sup.1, X.sup.2, X.sup.3, X.sup.4, X.sup.5, X.sup.6, X.sup.7 and X.sup.8, (and typically X.sup.1 and X.sup.8) independently, are
<br/><br/> ##STR00015##
<br/><br/> In general, sucrose fatty acid esters, including mixtures of sucrose fatty acid esters, can have varying HLB values, such as HLB values ranging from at or about 1 to at or about 20.  The HLB value of the sucrose fatty acid ester generally
depends on the degree of esterification (e.g., the average degree of esterification in a mixture of different esters).  Typically, the lower the degree of esterification (e.g., average degree), the higher the HLB value of the sucrose fatty acid ester or
mixture thereof.  Exemplary sucrose esters include sucrose distearate (HLB=3), sucrose distearate/monostearate (HLB 12), sucrose dipalmitate (HLB=7.4); sucrose monostearate (HLB=15), sucrose monopalmitate (HLB&gt;10); Sucrose monolaurate (HLB 15). 
Typically, the sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants in the provided compositions have an HLB value of between at or about 14 and at or about 20, such as at or about 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20, and typically between at or about 14 and at or about 18,
such as, but not limited to, HLB values of at or about 15, 16 and 17, such as, for example, sucrose ester surfactants including sucrose monopalmitate, sucrose monolaurate and sucrose monostearate.
<br/><br/> The sugar ester surfactants include sucrose ester blends, for example, sucrose ester mixtures containing a specified amount (e.g., percent, by weight) of sucrose monoesters.  Exemplary surfactants include sucrose ester mixtures having at least
at or about 50%, by weight (w/w), monoester, such as at or about or at least at or about 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90,
91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100%, by weight (w/w), sucrose monoesters, and typically at least at or about 60%, by weight or at least at or about 70%, by weight (w/w), monoesters.  The surfactants include mixtures of sucrose esters containing at
least at or about 50% sucrose monoesters, mixtures of sucrose esters containing at least at or about 60% sucrose monoesters, mixtures of sucrose esters containing at least at or about 70% sucrose monoesters, mixtures of sucrose esters containing at least
at or about 80% sucrose monoesters, and mixtures of sucrose esters containing at least at or about 90% sucrose monoesters, for example, mixtures containing at or about 72% sucrose monoesters, at or about 61% sucrose monoesters, or at or about 90% sucrose
monoesters.
<br/><br/> The sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants include sucrose fatty acid monoesters, such as sucrose monocaprylate, sucrose monodecanoate, sucrose monolaurate, sucrose monomyristate, sucrose monopalmitate, sucrose monostearate, sucrose
monopelargonate, sucrose monoundecanoate, sucrose monotridecanoate, sucrose monopentadecanoate and sucrose monoheptadecanoate.  The sucrose fatty acid esters further include mixtures containing varying percentages of monoesters, diesters, triesters and
polyesters, such as, but not limited to, a mixture having at or about 72% monoesters, 23% diesters, 5% triesters and 0% polyesters; a mixture having at or about 61% monoesters, 30% diesters, 7% triesters, and 2% polyesters; and a mixtures having at or
about 52% monoesters, 36% diesters, 10% triesters and 2% polyesters.
<br/><br/> The sucrose fatty acid ester surfactants include sucrose fatty acid esters sold under the trade name DK Ester.RTM., produced by Dai-Ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd of Japan (which, in some examples, can be produced according to the methods described
in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  4,898,935, 4,996,309, 4,995,911, 5,011,922 and 5,017,697, and distributed through Montello Inc., Tulsa, Okla., such as the F-160 and F-140 grade esters sold under the trade name DK Ester.RTM., and sucrose esters sold under the trade

<br/><br/> (2) Production of Sucrose Esters
<br/><br/> As noted above, methods for producing sucrose esters are well known (see, for example, U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  3,480,616, 3,644,333, 3,714,144, 4,710,567, 4,898,935, 4,996,309, 4,995,911, 5,011,922 and 5,017,697 and International Patent Application,
Publication No. WO 2007/082149).  The sucrose fatty acid surfactants can be produced by any well known method, and typically in an esterification reaction, for example, by reacting sucrose with a methyl ester of the desired fatty acid, such as a solvent
process, where sucrose is reacted with a methyl ester of a fatty acid in the presence of a catalyst (e.g., potassium carbonate) and an organic solvent (e.g., dimethyl formamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)), followed by purification, or in an
aqueous medium process, where sucrose is mixed in a molten mixture with fatty acid salt using water without an organic solvent and then reacted with a higher fatty acid methyl ester in the presence of a catalyst, followed by purification, and such as by
any of the methods described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2007/082149, whereby a sucrose molecule (which is a disaccharide containing one six-carbon aldo-sugar glucose linked to a five-carbon keto-sugar fructose, having the
formula: C.sub.12H.sub.22O.sub.11) is joined to one or more fatty acids.
<br/><br/> For example, the sucrose fatty acid ester can be produced by esterification using dimethyl formamide (DMF) as a solvent, by producing a methyl ester of the fatty acid and then reacting the methyl ester with sucrose in DMF in the presence of a
catalyst (e.g., potassium carbonate), for example, for 4-6 hours at 83-95.degree.  C., for example, using 30 to 127 parts sucrose to 30 parts methyl ester of the fatty acid (e.g., methyl stearate), 2 parts potassium carbonate and 300 parts solvent; by a
similar method, but using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the solvent, for example, as described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,480,616; or, as described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,644,333, by mixing sucrose with methyl fatty acid and sodium fatty acid and previously
prepared sucrose ester, using potassium carbonate as a catalyst and water as a solvent; or, as described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,714,144, where sodium, potassium or lithium soap of the fatty acid is reacted in a molten sugar solution for two to twenty
minutes under vacuum at 170-190.degree.  C., and purified, for example, as described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,710,567, by adding aqueous salt solution followed by three-phase separation.  In one example, the sucrose fatty acid esters are prepared and
purified as described in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  4,898,935, 4,996,309, 4,995,911, 5,011,922 and 5,017,697, by producing the esters by chemical catalysis, such as with the solvent process, e.g., using a DMSO solvent and potassium carbonate catalyst, or aqueous
solution method, followed by extraction and purification of the sucrose fatty acid esters, e.g., by adjusting pH, precipitation, separation and neutralization and filtration.
<br/><br/> In another example, the sucrose fatty acid esters can be produced, as described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2007/082149, by mixing and reacting sucrose and vinyl esters of the fatty acids which can produce sucrose
fatty acid ester mixtures with a monoester content of at or about 90%, and/or an acid value of less than 1.  Briefly, this process can be carried out by dissolving sucrose in a solvent (e.g., DMSO), at a reaction temperature of between at or about
30.degree.  C. and at or about 60.degree.  C., such as between about 40.degree.  C. and 60.degree.  C. (e.g., at 60.degree.  C.), and a catalyst added and the mixture stirred, such as for 30 minutes, followed by removal of undissolved catalyst by
decanting or filtration, followed by addition of vinyl fatty acid, and reaction, such as for at or about 15 minutes, with monitoring to measure amount of vinyl fatty acid ester, for example, until the amount of vinyl fatty acid ester reaches no more than
at or about 10%, by weight (w/w), of the starting amount.  The amount of sucrose and vinyl ester can vary.  In one example, the ratio of sucrose to vinyl ester is between at or about 2:1 and at or about 8:1.  In one example, the sucrose is added at a
concentration of at or about 400 nm and the vinyl ester added at a concentration of at or about 100 nM.  The catalyst can be catalyzed by a base, such as metal oxides, metal hydroxides and metal carbonates, such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide,
potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate and lithium carbonate, which can be added at a concentration of between at or about 1.5 grams/L and at or about 6 g/L of reaction volume.  In one example, the vinyl ester is vinyl stearate and the catalyst is
potassium carbonate.  The resulting mixture can then purified, such as by vacuum distillation and addition of sodium chloride to effect emulsification and purification methods described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2007/082149.
<br/><br/> (3) PEG-Derivatives of Vitamin E
<br/><br/> The SFAE(s) or mixtures thereof, can be mixed with a PEG-derivative(s) of vitamin E or analogs thereof, such that the total amount is still within the range of the surfactants as described herein.  Among the PEG-derived surfactants are
PEG-derivatives of Vitamin E, such as tocopherol and tocotrienol-derived surfactants, in which the Vitamin E moiety represents the hydrophobic region of the surfactant, and is attached, via a linker, to another moiety, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG)
moiety.  Exemplary of the Vitamin-E derived surfactants include, but are not limited to, tocopherol-derived surfactants, including polyalkylene glycol derivatives of tocopherol, typically polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives of tocopherol, such as
tocopherol polyethylene glycol diesters (TPGD), e.g., tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS), TPGS analogs, TPGS homologs, and TPGS derivatives.  Exemplary surfactants also include other PEG derivatives having similar properties, for example,
PEG derivatives of sterols, e.g., a cholesterol or a sitosterol (including, for example, any of the PEG derivatives disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,632,443) and PEG-derivatives of other fat-soluble vitamins, for example, some forms of Vitamin A (e.g.,
Retinol) or Vitamin D (e.g., Vitamin D1-D5).
<br/><br/> The surfactants include polyethylene glycol (PEG)-derivatives of Vitamin E, for example, a tocopherol polyethylene glycol diester (TPGD).  In one example, the TPGD is selected from among tocopherol sebacate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol
dodecanedioate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol suberate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol azelaate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol citraconate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol methylcitraconate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol itaconate polyethylene glycol,
tocopherol maleate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol glutarate polyethylene glycol, tocopherol glutaconate polyethylene glycol and tocopherol phthalate polyethylene glycol.  In another example, the TPGD surfactant is a tocopherol polyethylene glycol
succinate (TPGS), such as a TPGS-1000 and/or a d-.alpha.  TPGS.  In another example, the surfactant is a TPGS analog.  In one aspect, the surfactant is a TPGS homolog, such as, for example, a TPGS homolog that differs from a TPGS parent compound by the
addition or removal of one or more methylene unit(s), e.g., --(CH.sub.2).sub.n--.
<br/><br/> The PEG moieties in the PEG-derived surfactants, including the PEG moieties in the PEG-derivatives of Vitamin E, include PEG moieties selected from among any one or more of PEG-OH, PEG-NHS, PEG-aldehyde, PEG-SH, PEG-NH.sub.2, PEG -CO.sub.2H,
methylated PEGs (m-PEGs) and branched PEGs, and includes PEG moieties having a molecular weight of between 200 kDa or about 200 kDa to 20,000 kDa or about 20,000 kDa, typically between 200 kDa or about 200 kDa and 6000 kDa or about 6000 kDa, for example,
between 600 kDa or about 600 kDa and 6000 kDa or about 6000 kDa, typically between 200 kDa or about 200 kDa and 2000 kDa or about 2000 kDa, between 600 kDa or about 600 kDa and 1500 kDa or about 1500 kDa, or between 600 kDa or about 600 kDa and 1000 kDa
or about 1000 kDa.
<br/><br/> The Vitamin E-derived surfactants (e.g., tocopherol-derived or a tocotrienol-derived surfactants) include polyalkylene glycol derivatives of Vitamin E, typically polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives of Vitamin E, for example, PEG derivatives of
tocopherol or tocotrienol.  Suitable PEG derivatives of Vitamin E typically contain one or more tocopherols or tocotrienols, joined (for example, by an ester, ether, amide or thioester bond) with one or more PEG moieties, via a linker, for example, a
dicarboxylic acid linker.  An exemplary surfactant is shown schematically below:
<br/><br/> ##STR00016## where the line between the PEG and Linker; and the line between the Linker and Vitamin E each independently represent a covalent bond selected from among an ester, ether, amide or thioester.
<br/><br/> Typically, the Vitamin E PEG derivatives are made by joining the PEG moiety, via esterification, to a vitamin E-linker conjugate (e.g., a tocopherol-linker conjugate).  In one example, the tocopherol-linker conjugate first is formed by
covalently joining (by esterification) the hydroxyl moiety of tocopherol with a dicarboxylic acid to produce an ester bond.  In this example, the tocopherol-linker conjugate is a tocopherol ester (such as tocopherol succinate).  The esterification
reaction can be performed by any of a number of known methods (see, for example, U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  2,680,749, 4,665,204, 3,538,119 and 6,632,443).  To make the tocopherol-PEG surfactant, the resulting tocopherol ester then is joined (via the linker) to
the PEG molecule, in another esterification reaction.  In this example, the resulting surfactant is a tocopherol polyethylene glycol diester (TPGD).
<br/><br/> Alternatively, PEG derivatives of a tocopherol-linker or tocotrienol-linker conjugate can be made by other methods.  Various methods known in the art for producing PEG derivatives can be used to join a PEG molecule to tocopherol-linker or
tocotrienol-linker compounds.  For example, a tocopherol-linker conjugate can be covalently bonded to the PEG molecule via an amide, ether or thioether bond.  For example, a tocopherol-linker conjugate that contains an amine group can be reacted with a
PEG-NHS derivative to form an amide bond between the tocopherol-linker and the PEG molecule.  A tocopherol-linker conjugate that contains an amine group can be reacted with a PEG-aldehyde derivative to form an amide bond between the tocopherol-linker and
the PEG molecule.  In another example, a tocopherol-linker that contains an carboxylic acid can be activated to the corresponding acid halide and reacted with a PEG-SH derivative to form a thioester bond between the tocopherol-linker and the PEG
molecule.
<br/><br/> (a) Tocopherols and Tocotrienols
<br/><br/> The tocopherol(s) used to make the surfactant can be any natural or synthetic Vitamin E tocopherol, including but not limited to alpha-tocopherols, beta-tocopherols, gamma-tocopherols and delta tocopherols, either in pure forms or in
heterogenous mixtures of more than one form.  Exemplary tocopherols are d-.alpha.-tocopherols and d,1-tocopherols.  To make the surfactant, the tocopherol typically is esterified with a linker, for example, a dicarboxylic acid, to form a tocopherol
ester, which then is joined to a PEG moiety.
<br/><br/> The tocotrienol(s) used to make the surfactants can be any natural or synthetic Vitamin E tocotrienol, including but not limited to alpha-tocotrienols, beta-tocotrienols, gamma-tocotrienols and delta tocotrienols, either in pure forms or in
heterogenous mixtures of more than one form.  Mixtures of tocopherols and tocotrienols, are contemplated for use in the provided methods and compositions.  A tocotrienol can be esterified with a linker, such as a dicarboxylic acid, before joining with a
PEG moiety.
<br/><br/> (b) PEG Moieties
<br/><br/> The PEG used in the tocopherol-PEG derivative can be any of a plurality of known PEG moieties.  Exemplary of suitable PEG moieties are PEG moieties having varying chain lengths, and varying molecular weights, for example, PEG 1000, PEG 200, PEG
500, and PEG 20,000.  The numbers following individual PEG moieties indicate the molecular weight (in kilodaltons (kDa) of the PEG moieties.  The PEG moiety of the tocopherol-derived surfactant typically has a molecular weight of between 200 kDa or about
200 kDa and 20,000 kDa or about 20,000 kDa, typically between 200 kDa or about 200 kDa and 6000 kDa or about 6000 kDa, for example, between 600 kDa or about 600 kDa and 6000 kDa or about 6000 kDa, typically between 200 kDa or about 200 kDa and 2000 or
about 2000 kDa, between 600 or about 600 kDa and 1500 kDa or about 1500 kDa, such as but not limited to 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, and 1000 kDa.  Exemplary of a PEG-derivative of tocopherol ester having a PEG moiety with 1000 kDa is TPGS-1000.  Also
exemplary of suitable PEG moieties are PEG moieties that are modified, for example, methylated PEG (m-PEG), which is a PEG chain capped with a methyl group.  Other known PEG analogs also can be used.  The PEG moieties can be selected from among any
reactive PEG, including, but not limited to, PEG-OH, PEG-NHS, PEG-aldehyde, PEG-SH, PEG -NH.sub.2, PEG-CO.sub.2H, and branched PEGs.
<br/><br/> (c) Linkers
<br/><br/> Typically, the PEG derivatives of Vitamin E are diesters or other esters, e.g., triesters.  When the PEG derivative is a diester, the linker joining the Vitamin E to the PEG typically is a carboxylic acid, typically a dicarboxylic acid, as in,
for example, tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS), where the linker is a succinic acid, and the surfactant is made by an esterification reaction joining a PEG moiety and a tocopherol ester of the dicarboxylic acid.  In another example, the
linker is another molecule, for example, an amino acid, such as glycine, alanine, 5-aminopentanoic acid or 8-aminooctanoic acid; or an amino alcohol, such as ethanolamine.
<br/><br/> (d) Tocopherol Polyethylene Glycol and Tocotrienol Polyethylene Glycol Diesters (Dicarboxylic Acid Esters of Vitamin E Linked to PEG)
<br/><br/> Typically, the Vitamin E PEG derivatives are vitamin E polyethylene glycol diesters, which are Vitamin E esters of PEG, made by joining a Vitamin E ester to one or more PEG moieties by esterification.  Exemplary of the Vitamin E diesters are
tocopherol polyethylene glycol diesters (TPGD) and tocotrienol polyethylene glycol diesters.
<br/><br/> When the tocopherol or tocotrienol ester linked with the PEG moiety is a tocopherol ester of a dicarboxylic acid (e.g., tocopherol succinate), the linker is a dicarboxylic acid (a carboxylic acid having two carboxy groups, e.g., succinic acid). 
In this example, the tocopherol or tocotrienol PEG diester is formed by esterification reaction, in which PEG is attached to a tocopherol ester of a dicarboxylic acid.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of dicarboxylic acids that can be used as linkers in these tocopherol and tocotrienol PEG diester surfactants are succinic acid, sebacic acid, dodecanedioic acid, suberic acid, or azelaic acid, citraconic acid, methylcitraconic acid,
itaconic acid, maleic acid, glutaric acid, glutaconic acid, fumaric acids and phthalic acids.  Accordingly, exemplary of the tocopherol esters that can be esterified to form the PEG-derivatives are tocopherol succinate, tocopherol sebacate, tocopherol
dodecanodioate, tocopherol suberate, tocopherol azelaate, tocopherol citraconate, tocopherol methylcitraconate, tocopherol itaconate, tocopherol maleate, tocopherol glutarate, tocopherol glutaconate, and tocopherol phthalate, among others.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the vitamin E polyethylene glycol diesters made with dicarboxylic acids are compounds having the following formula shown in scheme I below (and homologs, analogs and derivatives thereof):
<br/><br/> ##STR00017## where R.sup.1, R.sup.2, R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 each independently is H or Me; each dashed line is independently a single or double bond; n is an integer from 1-5000; m and q each independently are 0 or 1; and p is an integer from 1-20. In one example, the surfactant is a compound where, when each of m and q is 0, p is an integer between 2-20.
<br/><br/> In one example, the surfactant has the following formula shown in Scheme II below (including homologs, analogs and derivatives thereof):
<br/><br/> ##STR00018## where R.sup.1, R.sup.2, R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 each independently is hydrogen (H) or methyl (CH.sub.2); the bond represented by the dashed line is either a single or double bond, m is an integer from 1 to 20, and n is an integer from 1
to 5000.
<br/><br/> In another example, the surfactant is a TPGS analog, such as, but not limited to, compound other than TPGS having the formula shown in SCHEME III:
<br/><br/> ##STR00019## where R.sup.1, R.sup.2, R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 each independently is hydrogen (H) or methyl (CH.sub.2); the bond represented by the dashed line is either a single or double bond, m is an integer from 1 to 20, and n is an integer from 1
to 5000.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of tocopherol and tocotrienol PEG diesters that can be used as surfactants in the provided compositions and methods include, but are not limited to: tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinates (TPGS; including D-.alpha.  TPGS and
d,1-TPGS; see for example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,102,078), tocopherol polyethylene glycol sebacate (PTS; see for example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,632,443), tocopherol polyethylene glycol dodecanodioate (PTD; see for example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,632,443), tocopherol
polyethylene glycol suberate (PTSr; see for example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,632,443) and tocopherol polyethylene glycol azelaate (PTAz; see for example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,632,443), polyoxyethanyl tocotrienyl sebacate (PTrienS, for example, PTrienS-600; see
for example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,632,443), as well as analogs, homologs and derivatives or any of the tocopherol diesters.
<br/><br/> (e) Other Vitamin E PEG Esters
<br/><br/> In another example, the tocopherol ester joined to the PEG to form the tocopherol PEG diester is a tocopherol ester of a tricarboxylic acid, for example, Citric acid, Isocitric acid, Aconitic acid and Propane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid
(tricarballylic acid, carballylic acid) or a carboxylic acid having three or more carboxy groups.
<br/><br/> In another example, the PEG derivatives of tocopherol are tocopherol polyethylene glycol triesters (TPGT), for example, esters containing a tocopherol, a linker, a PEG moiety, and an additional moiety, for example, an additional tocopherol, a
second PEG moiety, or a water-soluble group, such as a quaternary amine.  In one example, when the triester contains two PEG moieties, each PEG moiety has a smaller chain length (and lower molecular weight) than the PEG moiety in a PEG derivative of
tocopherol, having similar properties, that contains only one PEG chain.
<br/><br/> (f) TPGS Surfactants
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the tocopherol polyethylene glycol diester surfactants are TPGS, and analogs, homologs and derivatives thereof.  TPGS is a natural surfactant that is GRAS and Kosher certified and thus, desirable for use in products designated for
human consumptions, for example, beverages, food and nutritional supplements.  TPGS typically has an HLB value of between 16 or about 16 and 18 or about 18.  Exemplary of the TPGS surfactants is TPGS-1000, which has a PEG moiety of 1000 kDa.  Exemplary
of the TPGS surfactants that can be used in the provided compositions is the food grade TPGS surfactant sold under the name Eastman Vitamin E TPGS.RTM., food grade, by Eastman Chemical Company, Kingsport, Tenn.  This surfactant is a water-soluble form of
natural-source vitamin E, which is prepared by esterifying the carboxyl group of crystalline d-alpha-tocopheryl acid succinate with polyethylene glycol 1000 (PEG 1000), and contains between 260 and 300 mg/g total tocopherol.  A similar compound can be
made by esterifying the carboxyl group of the d,1 form of synthetic Vitamin E with PEG 1000.  It forms a clear liquid when dissolved 20% in water.  This tocopheryl polyethylene glycol is a water-soluble preparation of a fat-soluble vitamin (vitamin E),
for example, as disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  3,102,078, 2,680,749 and U.S.  Published Application Nos.  2007/0184117 and 2007/0141203.  The PEG moiety of alternative TPGS surfactants can have a molecular weight range of between about 200 kDa or 200 kDa
to 20,000 kDa or about 20,000 kDa, for example, between 600 kDa or about 600 kDa and 6000 kDa or about 6000 kDa, typically between 600 kDa or about 600 kDa and 1500 kDa or about 1500 kDa.  Also exemplary of the TPGS surfactant that can be used in the
provided compositions is the Water Soluble Natural Vitamin E (TPGS), sold by ZMC-USA, The Woodlands, Tex.  Any known source of TPGS, or any analog, homolog or derivative thereof, can be used.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of TPGS analogs are compounds, other than TPGS, that are similar to a parent TPGS compound, but differ slightly in composition, for example, by the variation, addition or removal of an atom, one or more units (e.g., methylene
unit(s)--(CH.sub.2).sub.n) or one or more functional groups.
<br/><br/> At room temperature, TPGS typically is a waxy low-melting solid.  In one example, the TPGS is heated prior to use, for example, to at least the melting temperature, for example, between 37.degree.  C. or about 37.degree.  C. and 41.degree.  C.
or about 41.degree.  C. and the desired amount is poured out.  In another example, the TPGS can be added as a waxy solid to a vessel and heated with the heating apparatus.
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of the surfactants are TPGS analogs, which include Vitamin E derived surfactants, including PEG derivatives of Vitamin E, including vitamin E PEG diesters, such as, but not limited to, tocopherol polyethylene glycol sebacate
(PTS), tocopherol polyethylene glycol dodecanodioate (PTD), tocopherol polyethylene glycol suberate (PTSr), tocopherol polyethylene glycol azelaate (PTAz) and polyoxyethanyl tocotrienyl sebacate (PTrienS) as well as other PEG derivatives of Vitamin E.
<br/><br/> ii.  Concentration of the Surfactant
<br/><br/> Typically, the concentration of the surfactant(s) (i.e., the SFAE or mixtures thereof or SFAE(s) and PEG-derivatives of vitamin E) in a particular concentrate composition is selected, as described herein, by formulating an initial concentrate
with a surfactant(s) concentration within a starting concentration range, followed by evaluation of the initial concentrate and, optionally, adjusting the surfactant(s) concentration.  Alternatively, the surfactant concentration can be chosen based on
the concentration of surfactant in one or more existing liquid concentrate formulas.
<br/><br/> Liquid nanoemulsion concentrates provided herein contain a relatively large amount of a polar solvent phase compared to the smaller oil phase that contains the non-polar compound(s) and surfactant (SFAE or SFAE/Vitamin E derivative). 
Emulsification (miscibility) of the oil phase and water phase can depend on the viscosity of the oil phase.  Emulsification can be difficult the larger the load of surfactant in the oil phase.  The Vitamin E derivatives have relatively high molecular
weights, and hence emulsification can be difficult.  For example, Vitamin E TPGS, a PEG-derivative of Vitamin E surfactant, has a molecular weight of about 1513 g/mol. It is shown herein that addition of even a relatively small amount, for example, at
least 1% or at least about 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% or 10% of a sucrose fatty acid ester renders the oil phase more readily emulsified into the aqueous phase.  Thus, in the compositions herein, sucrose fatty acid esters are added in place of
the vitamin E derivative, while maintaining the same relative percentage of surfactant.  The resulting compositions are rendered more readily emulsified.  Processing and ease of emulsification of the oil, which the SFAE is encapsulating, into water are
improved.
<br/><br/> Although the SFAE improves the processing ease, a composition containing an SFAE may not be as clear as, for example, a composition containing a concentrate made with Vitamin E TPGS.  Thus, the amount of SFAE is adjusted depending upon the
clarity of the composition that is desired.  For example, the SFAE containing compositions can be added to juices and sports drinks, such as GATORADE sports drink that are cloudy.  The amount of SFAE can be adjusted depending upon the beverage or
composition into which the concentrate is added.
<br/><br/> Typically, the concentration of the surfactant is between 16% or about 16% and 30% or about 30% (w/w), for example, 16% or about 16%, 17% or about 17%, 18% or about 18%, 19% or about 19%, 20% or about 20%, 21% or about 21%, 22% or about 22%, 23%
or about 23%, 24% or about 24%, 25% or about 25%, 26% or about 26%, 27% or about 27%, 28% or about 28%, 29% or about 29%, 30% or about 30%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate.  Exemplary of surfactant concentrations within the appropriate concentration
range are 17.75% and 25.2% (w/w) of the concentrate.  Typically, the concentration of surfactant is less than or equal to 30% or about 30% (w/w) of the concentrate.  When the concentrate contains a mixture of sucrose fatty acid esters and a
PEG-derivative of Vitamin E as surfactants, the compositions typically contain at least 1% or at least about 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% or 10% sucrose fatty esters.
<br/><br/> In one example, the concentration range of the surfactant is between 17% or about 17% and 25% or about 25% (w/w) of the concentrate.  In another example, the concentration range of the surfactant is between 18% or about 18% and 25% or about 25%
(w/w) of the concentrate.  In another example, the concentration range of the surfactant is between 18% or about 18% and 20% or about 20% (w/w) of the concentrate.  In another example, the concentration range of the surfactant is between 17% or about 17%
and 20% or about 20% (w/w) of the concentrate.  In another example, the concentration range of the surfactant is between 16% or about 16% and 20% or about 20% (w/w) of the concentrate.
<br/><br/> iii.  HLB
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the properties of the surfactant(s) that contribute to the desirable properties of the compositions is the HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) of the surfactant(s).  Generally, HLB is a value, derived from a semi-empirical formula,
which is used to index surfactants according to their relative hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity.  An HLB value is a numerical representation of the relative representation of hydrophilic groups and hydrophobic groups in a surfactant or mixture of
surfactants.  The weight percent of these respective groups indicates properties of the molecular structure.  See, for example, Griffin, W. C. J. Soc.  Cos.  Chem. 1:311 (1949).
<br/><br/> Surfactant HLB values range from 1-45, while the range for non-ionic surfactants typically is from 1-20.  The more lipophilic a surfactant is, the lower its HLB value.  Conversely, the more hydrophilic a surfactant is, the higher its HLB value. 
Lipophilic surfactants have greater solubility in oil and lipophilic substances, while hydrophilic surfactants dissolve more easily in aqueous media.  In general, surfactants with HLB values greater than 10 or greater than about 10 are called
"hydrophilic surfactants," while surfactants having HLB values less than 10 or less than about 10 are referred to as "hydrophobic surfactants."
<br/><br/> HLB values have been determined and are available for a plurality of surfactants (e.g., see U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,267,985).  It should be appreciated that HLB values for a given surfactant or co-surfactant can vary, depending upon the empirical
method used to determine the value.  Thus, HLB values of surfactants and co-surfactants provide a rough guide for formulating compositions based on relative hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity.  For example, a surfactant typically is selected from among
surfactants having HLB values within a particular range of the surfactant or co-surfactant that can be used to guide formulations.  Table 1A lists HLB values of exemplary surfactants and co-surfactants.
<br/><br/> The surfactants and HLB values set forth in Table 1A are exemplary.  Any known surfactant or co-surfactant can be used with the provided compositions (e.g., see U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,267,985), provided that it has appropriate HLB value, such as an
HLB value between at or about 14 and at or about 20.  The surfactant(s) used in the provided concentrate typically has an HLB value between 14 or about 14 and 20 or about 20, for example, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, about 14, about 15, about 16, about
17, about 18, about 19 or about 20.  Exemplary of the surfactants include, but are not limited to, non-ionic surfactants, such as sugar esters, such as sucrose fatty acid esters and mixtures thereof, such as sucrose fatty acid ester mixtures including
monoesters, including any of the sucrose fatty acid esters, analogs, homologs and derivatives thereof.  Other known surfactants having HLB values between 14 or about 14 and 20 or about 20, typically between about 15 and 18, also can be suitable. 
Typically, the surfactant is a natural surfactant, for example, a surfactant that is G.R.A.S.  (generally recognized as safe) by the FDA and/or Kosher certified.
<br/><br/> d. Co-Surfactants (Emulsifiers)
<br/><br/> In one example, the liquid concentrate further contains one or more co-surfactants (emulsifiers).  For example, a co-surfactant can be included to improve emulsification of the active ingredient and/or the stability of the composition, for
example, by preventing or slowing oxidation of the non-polar compound.  Exemplary of a co-surfactant used in the provided concentrates is a phospholipid, for example, phosphatidylcholine.
<br/><br/> i. Phospholipids
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the co-surfactants that can be used in the provided compositions are phospholipids.  Phospholipids are amphipathic lipid-like molecules, typically containing a hydrophobic portion at one end of the molecule and a hydrophilic portion
at the other end of the molecule.  A number of phospholipids can be used as ingredients in the provided compositions, for example, lecithin, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC),
phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylinositol (PI), sphingomyelin (SPM) or a combination thereof.  Typically, the phospholipid is phosphatidylcholine (PC), which sometimes is referred to by the general
name "lecithin." Exemplary of the phospholipids that can be used as co-surfactants in the provided compositions are the phospholipids sold by Lipoid, LLC, Newark, N.J., for example, Purified Egg Lecithins, Purified Soybean Lecithins, Hydrogenated Egg and
Soybean Lecithins, Egg Phospholipids, Soybean Phospholipids, Hydrogenated Egg and Soybean Phospholipids.  Synthetic Phospholipids, PEG-ylated Phospholipids and phospholipid blends sold by Lipoid, LLC.  Exemplary of the phosphatidylcholine that can be
used as a co-surfactant in the provided compositions is the phosphatidylcholine composition sold by Lipoid, LLC, under the name Lipoid S100, which is derived from soy extract and contains greater than 95% or greater than about 95% phosphatidylcholine.
<br/><br/> In one example, the phospholipid, for example, PC, represents less than or equal to 1% or about 1%, by weight (w/w) of the concentrate.  In one example, the phosphatidylcholine represents between 0.1% or about 0.1% and 1% or about 1%, for
example, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.6, 0.65, 0.66, 0.6690, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95%, per weight (w/w), of the concentrate.  In one example, the phospholipid represents between 0.15% or about 0.15% and 0.7% or about 0.7%,
by weight (w/w) of the concentrate.
<br/><br/> e. Polar Solvents
<br/><br/> The compositions, including the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates and the liquid dilution compositions, further include polar solvents.  Polar solvents are well known in the art.  The polarity of a solvent generally indicates which compounds are
soluble in the solvent, and with which other solvents/liquids the solvent is miscible.  Generally speaking, polar compounds are more readily solubilized in water and other polar solvents than are non-polar compounds.  Polar solvents are more likely to be
miscible with water and other polar solvents and liquids.
<br/><br/> The polarity of a solvent can be assessed by measuring a number of different parameters according to well known methods (see, e.g., Prizbytek, "High Purity Solvent Guide," Burdick and Jackson Laboratories, Inc., 1980), such as by determining a
property of the solvent such as the dielectric constant, the dipole moment, or the polarity index.  For example, polar solvents generally have high dielectric constants, typically dielectric constants greater than at or about 15 (see, e.g., Lowery et
al., Mechanism and Theory in Organic Chemistry, Harper Collins Publishers, 3.sup.rd ed., 1987, p. 177), such as at or about 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80 85, 90, or
greater than 90.  For example, the dielectric constant of water is at or about 80.10.  Polar solvents generally have high polarity indices, typically greater than at or about 3 (see, e.g., Snyder, "Classification of the solvent properties of common
liquids," J. Chromatography A, 92:223-230, 1974), such as at or about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 or greater than 9.  Polar solvents generally have large dipole moments, typically greater than at or about 1.4 Debye, such as at or about, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7,
1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.0, 3.5, 4 or greater than 4 Debye (see, e.g., "CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics," Lide, ed., 82.sup.nd edition, CRC Press, 2001, p. 15(14)-15(18)).  Other methods of assessing solvent polarity are known
in the art, including, but not limited to, the Kosower Z scale (Kosower, "An introduction to physical organic chemistry," Wiley, 1969, p. 293), the donor number and donor acceptor scale (Gutmann, "Solvent effects on the reactivities of organometallic
compounds," Coord.  Chem. Rev., 18:225-255, 1976), and the Hildebrand solubility parameters (see, e.g., Giddings et al., "High pressure gas chromatography of nonvolatile species.  Compressed gas is used to cause migration of intractable solutes,"
Science, 162:67-73, 1968).
<br/><br/> Polar solvents include polar protic solvents and polar aprotic solvents.  A polar protic solvent (e.g., water, methanol, ethanol) contains a hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom, such that the hydrogen has a proton-like character
and/or the bond between the hydrogen and electronegative atom is polarized.  Polar aprotic solvents, on the other hand, (e.g., acetone, acetonitrile), generally do not contain positively polarized hydrogen atoms.
<br/><br/> The polar solvents in the provided compositions typically are polar protic solvents, including, but not limited to, water; alcohols, including, but not limited to, dihydric alcohols (e.g., glycols, e.g., propylene glycol, ethylene glycol,
tetraethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol), which contain two hydroxyl groups, trihydric alcohols (e.g., glycerin, butane-1,2,3-triol, pentane-1,3,5-triol, 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol), which contain three hydroxyl
groups, monohydric alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol and t-butanol) and other alcohols; and acids, including but not limited to acetic acid and formic acid.  Other polar solvents include, but are not limited to, acetone,
acetonitrile, butyl acetate, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dioxane, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran and hexamethylphosphoric triamide.  Typically, the polar solvent is water, or is an alcohol that typically contains two or more hydroxyl groups,
such as a trihydric or dihydric alcohol, such as, but not limited to, glycerol and propylene glycol.  The polar solvents further include low molecular weight polyethylene glycols (PEGs), such as PEGs having a molecular weight not more than at or about
600 kDa, such as between at or about 200 kDa and at or about 600 kDa, typically not more than at or about 400 kDa, for example, not more than 200 kDa.
<br/><br/> In one example, the polar solvent has a dielectric constant greater than at or about 15, and typically between at or about 20 and at or about 80, such as at or about 80.1, 46.53, or 28.67.  In another example, the polar solvent has a polarity
index between at or about 3 and at or about 9.  In another example, the dipole moment of the polar solvent is between 1.5 and 3, and typically between at or about 1.8 and 2.8, such as 1.9, 2.6, and 2.2 (for dielectric constants of solvents, see, for
example, Landolt-Bornstein, New Series IV/17, Static Dielectric Constants of Pure Liquids and Binary Liquid Mixtures, Springer, 2008; and CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics," Lide, ed., 82.sup.nd edition, CRC Press, 2001; for dipole moment of
solvents, see, for example, CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics," Lide, ed., 82.sup.nd edition, CRC Press, 2001) and for polarity indices of solvents, see, for example, Snyder, "Classification of the solvent properties of common liquids," J.
Chromatography A, 92:223-230, 1974).
<br/><br/> The amount of the polar solvent typically is a high concentration, for example, within a concentration range of between 60% or about 60% and 80% or about 80%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate, for example, 60% or about 60%, 61% or about 61%,
62% or about 62%, 63% or about 63%, 64% or about 64%, 65% or about 65%, 66% or about 66%, 67% or about 67%, 68% or about 68%, 69% or about 69%, 70% or about 70%, 71% or about 71%, 72% or about 72%, 73% or about 73%, 74% or about 74%, 75% or about 75%,
76% or about 76%, 77% or about 77%, 78% or about 78%, 79% or about 79%, or 80% or about 80% (w/w) of the concentrate.  Exemplary of polar solvent concentrations in the provided liquid concentrates are 69.02%, 71.49%, 71.74%, 75.8165%, 74.25%, 68.7865%,
and 68.29% (w/w) of the concentrate.  In one example, the concentration range of the polar solvent is between 65% or about 65% and 80% or about 80% (w/w) of the concentrate.  In one example, the concentration range of the polar solvent is between 65% or
about 65% and 75% or about 75% (w/w) of the concentrate, or between 65% or about 65% and 76% or about 76%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate, or between 68% or about 68% and 75% or about 75%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate.
<br/><br/> In the provided methods for making the concentrates, the polar solvent (e.g., water, propylene glycol or glycerin) is added to the water phase.  In one example, the polar solvent is water, e.g., purified water, such as water that is purified
prior to adding it to the concentrate formula, for example, by charcoal filter, ion exchange, reverse osmosis, UV sterilization and/or filtering using a filter, for example, a 50-100 micron filter.  Typically, when a filter is used, it is an end point of
use filter, which filters the water before it reaches the tank in the provided process.  Alternatively, previously filtered water can be added to the concentrates.
<br/><br/> f. Preservatives and Sterilizers
<br/><br/> In one example, the provided liquid concentrate further comprises one or more preservatives (or preservatives) and/or sterilizers.  The preservative(s) can be included to improve the stability of the concentrate, and the compositions made by
diluting the concentrate, over time.  Preservatives, particularly food and beverage preservatives, are well known.  Any known preservative can be used in the provided compositions.  Exemplary of the preservatives that can be used in the provided
compositions are oil soluble preservatives, for example, benzyl alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate, Methyl Paraben, Propyl Paraben, antioxidants, for example, Vitamin E, Vitamin A Palmitate and Beta Carotene.  Typically, a preservative is selected that is safe for
human consumption, for example, in foods and beverages, for example, a GRAS certified and/or Kosher-certified preservative, for example, benzyl alcohol.
<br/><br/> The preservative typically represents less than 1%, less than about 1%, 1% or about 1%, by weight (w/w), of the liquid nanoemulsion concentrate or between 0.1% or about 0.1% and 1% or about 1%, by weight (w/w), of the concentrate, for example,
0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.725%, 0.75%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 1%, about 0.1%, about 0.2%, about 0.3%, about 0.4%, about 0.5%, about 0.6%, about 0.7%, about 0.8%, about 0.9%, about 1%, by weight (w/w), of the liquid concentrate.
<br/><br/> g. Emulsion Stabilizers (Co-Emulsifier)
<br/><br/> In one example, the provided liquid concentrates further contain one or more emulsion stabilizers (co-emulsifiers), which can be used to stabilize the liquid nanoemulsion concentrate and/or the aqueous compositions containing the diluted
concentrates.  In one example, the emulsion stabilizer increases the viscosity of the liquid concentrate.  In one example, one or more emulsion stabilizers is added, during formulation, after evaluation of an initial concentrate, particularly if the oil
and water phases of the initial concentrate (or the aqueous liquid dilution composition resulting from dilution of the initial concentrate) appear to be separating.  Addition of the emulsion stabilizer can prevent separation of the oil and water phases.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of an emulsion stabilizer that can be used in the provided compositions is a composition containing a blend of gums, for example, gums used as emulsifying agents, for example, a blend containing one or more of xanthan gum, guar gum and
sodium alginate, for example, the emulsion stabilizer sold under the brand name SALADIZER.RTM., available from TIC Gums, Inc.  (Belcamp, Md.).  Other gums can be included in the emulsion stabilizer, for example, gum acacia and sugar beet pectin.  Other
blends of similar gums can also be used as emulsion stabilizers.
<br/><br/> The emulsion stabilizer can be added to the water phase, the oil phase, and typically to the water and the oil phase, during formation of the liquid concentrates.  In one example, the emulsion stabilizer is added to the water phase at a
concentration, such that it represents less than 1% or about 1% w/w of the liquid concentrate.  In one example, the emulsion stabilizer is added to the water phase for a final concentration of between 0.1% or about 0.1% and 1% or about 1%, for example,
0.1%, 0.12%, 0.13%, 0.14%, 0.15%, 0.16%, 0.17%, 0.18%, 0.19%, 0.2%, 0.25%, 0.3%, 0.31%, 0.32%, 0.33%, 0.34%, 0.35%, 0.36%, 0.37%, 0.38%, 0.39%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9% or 1% w/w of the liquid concentrate.  In one example, the emulsion
stabilizer is added to the oil phase such that it represents less than 0.1% or about 0.1%, for example, between 0.01% or about 0.01% and 0.1% or about 0.1%, for example, 0.01%, 0.02%, 0.03%, 0.04%, 0.05%, 0.06%, 0.061%, 0.062%, 0.063%, 0.0635%, 0.07%,
0.08%, 0.09% or 0.1%, by weight (w/w) of the concentrate.  In one example, the emulsion stabilizer is added to the water phase and the oil phase, for example, at a concentration within the oil and water phase concentration ranges listed above.  In one
such example, the emulsion stabilizer represents less than 1%, for example, between 0.01% or about 0.01% and 1% or about 1% (w/w), emulsion stabilizer, for example, 0.01%, 0.02%, 0.03%, 0.04%, 0.05%, 0.06%, 0.061%, 0.062%, 0.063%, 0.0635%, 0.07%, 0.08%,
0.09%, 0.1%, 0.12%, 0.13%, 0.14%, 0.15%, 0.16%, 0.17%, 0.18%, 0.19%, 0.2%, 0.25%, 0.3%, 0.31%, 0.32%, 0.33%, 0.34%, 0.35%, 0.36%, 0.37%, 0.38%, 0.39%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9% or 1%, by weight (w/w), of the liquid concentrate.
<br/><br/> h. Non-Polar Solvents
<br/><br/> In one example, the liquid concentrates further contain a non-polar solvent, for example, an oil.  Typically, the non-polar solvent is included in the composition in addition to the non-polar active ingredient, and is used to dissolve the
non-polar active ingredient.  In one example, the solvent is an oil that is not contained in the non-polar active ingredient.  When a non-polar solvent is included in the concentrate, it typically is used to dissolve the non-polar compound before mixing
with the other ingredients, for example, before mixing with the other oil phase ingredients.  In one example, use of a non-polar solvent reduces the crystal size and/or increase the clarity of the aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the
diluted concentrate.  Exemplary of non-polar solvents that can be used in the provided concentrates are oils (in addition to the non-polar active ingredient), for example, Vitamin E oil, flaxseed oil, CLA, Borage Oil, D-limonene, Canola oil, corn oil,
MCT oil and oat oil.  Other oils also can be used.  Exemplary of the Vitamin E oil, used as a non-polar solvent in the provided compositions, is the oil sold by ADM Natural Health and Nutrition, Decatur, Ill., under the name Novatol.TM.  5-67 Vitamin E
(D-alpha-Tocopherol; ADM product code 410217).  This Vitamin E oil contains at least 67.2% Tocopherol and approximately 32.8% soybean oil.
<br/><br/> In one example, the concentration of the non-polar solvent is within a concentration range of between 1% or about 1% and 10% or about 10%, for example, 1%, 2%, 3%, 3.25%, 3.5%, 3.75%, 4%, 5%, 5.25%, 5.5% or 5.75%, w/w, of the concentrate.  In
another example, the concentration is within the concentration range of between 3% or about 3% and 6% or about 6%, w/w, of the liquid concentrate.  In another example, it is between 3.75% and 5.25% w/w, of the liquid concentrate.
<br/><br/> i. Flavors
<br/><br/> In one example, the concentrate further contains one or more flavors or flavoring agents, for example, any compound to add flavor to the concentrate and/or to the aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the diluted concentrate, for
example, the food or beverage containing the concentrate.  Several flavors are well known.  Any flavor can be added to the concentrates, for example, any flavor sold by Mission Flavors, Foothill Ranch, Calif.  Exemplary of flavors that can be used are
fruit flavors, such as guava, kiwi, peach, mango, papaya, pineapple, banana, strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, orange, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, lime and lemon-lime; cola flavors, tea flavors, coffee flavors, chocolate flavors, dairy flavors, root
beer and birch beer flavors, methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil, sweet birch oil), citrus oils and other flavors.  Typically, the flavors are safe and/or desirable for human consumption, for example, GRAS or Kosher-certified flavors.  Exemplary of
flavoring agents that can be used in the compositions are lemon oil, for example lemon oil sold by Mission Flavors, Foothill Ranch, Calif.; and D-limonene, for example, 99% GRAS certified D-Limonene, sold by Florida Chemical, Winter Haven, Fla. 
Typically, the flavor is added, using the provided methods, to the nanoemulsion concentrates after combining the oil and water phases.  Alternatively, flavor(s) can be added to the water and/or oil phase directly.
<br/><br/> Typically, the concentration of flavoring agent added to the provided concentrates is less than 5% or about 5%, typically less than 1% or about 1%, for example, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 0.37% or 0.525%.
<br/><br/> j. pH Adjusters
<br/><br/> In one example, one or more pH adjusters is added to the provided concentrates, typically to the emulsion that is formed after combining the water and oil phases according to the provided methods.  In particular, the pH adjuster is used in
compositions containing water.  Alternatively, the pH adjuster can be added, at an appropriate concentration to achieve a desired pH, to the oil phase and/or the water phase.  Typically, the pH adjuster is added to adjust the pH of the concentrate to
within a range of 2.0 or about 2.0 to 4.0 or about 4.0.  One or more of a plurality of pH adjusting agents can be used.  Typically, the pH adjusting agent is safe for human consumption, for example, GRAS certified.  Exemplary of a pH adjuster is citric
acid, for example, the citric acid sold by Mitsubishi Chemical, Dublin, Ohio.
<br/><br/> Typically, the concentration of pH adjuster added to the provided concentrates is less than 5% or about 5%, typically less than 1% or about 1%, for example, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 0.28% or 0.19%.
<br/><br/> 2.  Powder Forms of the Compositions
<br/><br/> The compositions also can be provided in powder form, i.e., powder that is made by converting the provided nanoemulsion concentrates into a powder, using one of several well-known methods (e.g., spray-drying and/or milling).  The powder
compositions include, but are not limited to, coated or uncoated swallowable or chewable tablets, dry powders in hard or soft gelatin capsules, and dry powders in individual or multiple use packages for reconstituted suspensions or sprinkles.  Preferable
solid dosage forms are coated or uncoated swallowable or chewable tablets.  Suitable methods for manufacturing the powder compositions are well known in the art.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the powder composition can further comprise at least one excipient.  Excipients include, but are not limited to, diluents (sometimes referred to as fillers) including, for example, microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, lactose,
calcium phosphate, dextrates, maltodextrin, starch, sucrose, and pregelatinized starch; disintegrants including, for example, crospovidone, sodium starch glycolate, croscarmellose sodium, starch, pregelatinized starch, and carboxymethylcellulose sodium;
binders including, for example, starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, pregelatinized starch, guar gum, alginic acid, acacia, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone; glidants including, for example, colloidal
silicon dioxide and talc; and lubricants/antiadherents including, for example, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, stearic acid, sodium stearyl fumarate, glyceryl monostearate, hydrogenated vegetable oil, and talc.  In one particular example, the
excipients are selected from any one or more of maltodextrin and gum acacia.
<br/><br/> The powder forms can be used for any convenient dosage amount of the non-polar compound.  Generally, the level of non-polar compound can be increased or decreased according to the judgment of the physician, pharmacist, pharmaceutical scientist,
or other person of skill in the art.  The amount of the remaining non-active ingredients can be adjusted as needed.
<br/><br/> Typically, the concentration of the excipients is within a concentration range of between 50% or about 50% and 85% or about 85%, for example, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75,
76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85 or more, %, by weight, of the free flowing powder.
<br/><br/> In one example, the powder form is a free-flowing powder.  Free-flowing powders can be obtained using techniques well known in the art, such as, but not limited to, spray drying, freeze drying or absorption plating.  In one example, in order to
achieve a free flowing powder, the protein derivative is formulated with an excipient such as lactose or starch.  For example, the formulation can be a spray-dried lactose formulation (see e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,916,163).
<br/><br/> The methods for forming the powders include spray drying.  Spray-drying processes and spray-drying equipment are described generally in Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, pages 20-54 to 20-57 (Sixth Edition 1984).  More details on
spray-drying processes and equipment are reviewed by Marshall, "Atomization and Spray-Drying," 50 Chem. Eng.  Prog.  Monogr.  Series 2 (1954), and Masters, Spray Drying Handbook (Fourth Edition 1985).  Methods for spray drying are well known (see, e.g.
U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,430,021 and 6,534,085 and U.S.  Application Publication No. US 2007/0184117).  In general, spray drying is used to dry a heated liquid by passing it through hot gas.  One or more spray nozzles is used to atomize the liquid in a
cooling tower or chamber.  As the material is atomized (sprayed), the surface tension causes a uniform spherical particle to form, which is passed through the cooling chamber and hardens into a solid intact sphere.  The spray dried particles can be
between at or about 0.5 microns and at or about 100 microns, and typically are less than at or about 10 microns, typically less than at or about 5 microns, and typically less than at or about, or at or about, 1 micron.
<br/><br/> Provided are methods for spray drying the liquid nanoemulsion compositions to form powder compositions.  In the spray drying methods, the liquid nanoemulsion compositions can be heated, e.g. to a temperature between at or about 100 and at or
about 150.degree.  F., typically between 110.degree.  F. and 140.degree.  F., e.g. at or about 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135 or 140.degree.  F. The compositions can be mixed while heating, such as with any of the mixers described herein, for example,
homogenizers (e.g. reversible homogenizers and piston-driven homogenization).
<br/><br/> For spray-drying, one or more excipients are mixed with a polar solvent, typically water, and heated, e.g. to a temperature between at or about 100.degree.  F. and at or about 150.degree.  F., typically between 110.degree.  F. and 140.degree. 
F., e.g. at or about 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135 or 140.degree.  F. In one example, the excipient is mixed with water in an amount of one part excipient (by weight) to two parts water (by weight).  The excipient-solvent (e.g. water) mixture can be mixed
while heating, e.g. using any of the mixers described herein, for example, homogenizers (e.g. reversible homogenizers and piston-driven homogenization) with heating during the mixing.  The heated liquid nanoemulsion composition and the heated
water-excipient mixture then are mixed together, such as by transferring one mixture to the other, e.g. by any of the transfer means provided herein.  Typically, the two mixtures are homogenized, e.g. with a reversible homogenizer or piston-driven
homogenizer or any other homogenizer.  The homogenized mixture then is subject to spray drying using a spray dryer.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the spray dryers are cyclone spray dryers.  During spray drying with cyclone spray dryers, the homogenized mixture is pumped into an atomizing device where it is broken into small droplets.  Upon contact with a stream of hot air,
the moisture is removed very rapidly from the droplets while still suspended in the drying air.  The dry powder is separated from the moist air in cyclones by centrifugal action.  The centrifugal action is caused by the great increase in air speed when
the mixture of particles and air enters the cyclone system.  The dense powder particles are forced toward the cyclone walls while the lighter, moist air is directed away through the exhaust pipes.  The powder settles to the bottom of the cyclone where it
is removed through a discharging device.  Sometimes the air-conveying ducts for the dry powder are connected with cooling systems which admit cold air for transport of the product through conveying pipes.  Cyclone dryers have been designed for large
production schedules capable of drying ton-lots of powder per hour.
<br/><br/> As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the inlet temperature and the outlet temperature of the spray drier are not critical but will be of such a level to provide the desired particle size, of less than at or about 1 micron, and to
result in a powder that has a desired property.  Typically, the ability of the free flowing powder to yield a clear (or relatively clear) liquid dilution composition upon dilution in an aqueous medium is the desired property that is evaluated.  In this
regard, the inlet and outlet temperatures are adjusted depending on the melting characteristics of the liquid nanoemulsion components and the composition of the homogenized liquid nanoemulsion concentrate/excipient mixture.  The inlet temperature is
between at or about 60.degree.  C. and at or about 170.degree.  C. with outlet temperatures between at or about 40.degree.  C. to at or about 120.degree.  C. Preferably inlet temperatures are from at or about 90.degree.  C. to at or about 120.degree.  C.
and outlet temperatures are from at or about 60.degree.  C. to at or about 90.degree.  C. The flow rate which is used in the spray drying equipment will generally be at or about 3 mL per minute to at or about 15 mL per minute.  The atomizer air flow rate
will very between values of at or about 25 L per minute to at or about 50 L per minute.  Commercially available spray dryers are well known to those of skill in the art, and suitable settings for any particular dispersion can be readily determined by one
of skill in the art without undue experimentation.  Operating conditions such as inlet temperature and outlet temperature, feed rate, atomization pressure, flow rate of the drying air, and nozzle configuration can be adjusted in accordance with the
manufacturer's guidelines.
<br/><br/> In some examples, the dry powder is stored into a capsule form or is pressed into a tablet.  For use as tablets, the compositions typically contain multiple other excipients.  These excipients include tablet disintegrants, such as the corn
starch, glidants, such as the silicon dioxide, and lubricants such as the magnesium stearate.  Ordinarily these compositions contain minor amounts by weight of glidants and lubricants, e.g., each two percent (2%) or less by weight.  Tablet disintegrants
are optionally present, and, if present, are included in sufficient amounts to assure that the tablet disintegrates upon ingestion.  According materials, such as corn starch are employed at concentrations of from about zero to about 30 percent by weight
of the composition.
<br/><br/> Free flowing powders also can be used to administer the active agent by inhalation using a dry powder inhaler.  Such dry powder inhalers typically administer the active agent as a free-flowing powder that is dispersed in a patient's air-stream
during inspiration.  In order to achieve a free flowing powder, the active agent is typically formulated with a suitable excipient such as lactose or starch.  For example, such a dry powder formulation can be made, for example, by combining the lactose
with the active agent and then dry blending the components.  Alternatively, if desired, the active agent can be formulated without an excipient.  The pharmaceutical composition is then typically loaded into a dry powder dispenser, or into inhalation
cartridges or capsules for use with a dry powder delivery device.  Examples of dry powder inhaler delivery devices include Diskhaler (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, N.C.) (see, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,035,237); Diskus (GlaxoSmithKline) (see,
e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,378,519; Turbuhaler (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Del.) (see, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,524,769); Rotahaler (GlaxoSmithKline) (see, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,353,365) and Handihaler (Boehringer Ingelheim).  Further examples of suitable
DPI devices are described in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,415,162, 5,239,993, and 5,715,810 and references cited therein.
<br/><br/> 3.  Liquid Dilution Compositions Containing the Diluted Concentrates
<br/><br/> Among the compositions provided herein are liquid dilution compositions, typically aqueous liquid dilution compositions, containing the non-polar compounds.  The aqueous liquid dilution compositions are made by diluting the provided liquid
nanoemulsion concentrates into aqueous media, for example, beverages, for example, water, flavored water, soda, milk, juices, including fruit juices, sauces, syrups, soups, sports drinks, nutritional beverages, energy drinks, vitamin-fortified beverages,
or any beverage.
<br/><br/> In one example, the aqueous liquid dilution compositions contains between 0.05 grams (g) or about 0.05 g and 10 g or about 10 g, typically between 0.05 g and 5 g, of the liquid concentrate per 8 fluid ounces or about 8 fluid ounces, at least 8
fluid ounces or at least about 8 fluid ounces, or less than 8 fluid ounces or less than about 8 fluid ounces, or per serving size, of the aqueous medium, for example, 0.05 g, 0.06 g, 0.07 g, 0.08 g, 0.09 g, 0.1 g, 0.2 g, 0.3 g, 0.4 g, 0.5 g, 0.6 g, 0.7
g, 0.8 g, 0.9 g, 1 g, 2 g, 3 g, 4 g, 5 g, 6 g, 7 g, 8 g, 9 g, or 10 g of the concentrate per 8 fluid ounces, about 8 fluid ounces, or at least 8 fluid ounces or at least about 8 fluid ounces of the aqueous medium, for example 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100, 200 or more fluid ounces, of aqueous medium.
<br/><br/> In another example, the aqueous liquid dilution composition contains between 1 mL or about 1 mL and 10 mL or about 10 mL of the liquid concentrate, for example, 1 mL, 2 mL, 3 mL, 4 mL, 5 mL, 6 mL, 7 mL, 8 mL, 9 mL or 10 mL of the concentrate,
per 8 fluid ounces, about 8 fluid ounces, at least 8 fluid ounces or at least about 8 fluid ounces, or less than 8 fluid ounces or less than about 8 fluid ounces, or per serving size, of the aqueous medium, for example 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100, 200 or more fluid ounces, of aqueous medium.
<br/><br/> In another example, the aqueous liquid dilution composition contains at least 10 mg or about 10 mg, typically at least 25 mg or about 25 mg, typically at least 35 mg, of the non-polar compound, for example, the non-polar active ingredient, per 8
fluid ounces or about 8 fluid ounces, at least 8 fluid ounces or at least about 8 fluid ounces of the aqueous medium, or less than 8 ounces or less than about 8 ounces, or per serving size, of the aqueous medium; for example, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425,
450, 475, 500, 550, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1500, 2000 mg, or more, of the non-polar compound per at least 8 fluid ounces or at least about 8 fluid ounces of aqueous medium.
<br/><br/> In another example, the aqueous liquid dilution composition contains the concentrate diluted at a dilution factor of between 1:10 or about 1:10 and at most 1:1000 or about 1:1000, typically between 1:10 or about 1:10 and 1:500 or about 1:500,
for example, at a dilution between 1:10 or about 1:10 and up to 1:250 or about 1:250, for example, diluted between 1:10 or about 1:10, 1:20 or about 1:20, 1:25 or about 1:25, 1:50 or about 1:50, 1:100 or about 1:100, 1:200 or about 1:200, 1:250 or about
1:250, or up to 1:500 or about 1:500, for example, 1:10, 1:20, 1:25, 1:30, 1:35, 1:40, 1:50, 1:55, 1:60, 1:65, 1:70, 1:75, 1:80, 1:85, 1:90, 1:95, 1:100, 1:110, 1:120, 1:130, 1:140, 1:150, 1:160, 1:170, 1:180, 1:190, 1:200, 1:210, 1:220, 1:230, 1:240,
1:250, 1:260, 1:270, 1:280, 1:290, 1:300, 1:350, 1:400 or 1:500.  In another example, the aqueous liquid dilution compositions contain the liquid concentrate diluted to any amount.  In another example the dilution is less than 1:10 or about 1:10.
<br/><br/> Properties of the provided liquid concentrates that are diluted into the aqueous medium contribute to various properties of the provided resulting aqueous liquid dilution compositions, for example, clarity; desirability for human consumption,
for example, pleasant taste, and/or smell, for example, lack of "fishy" taste/smell, lack of "ringing" and lack of crystal formation; stability, for example, lack of oxidation, "ringing" and/or precipitation over time; and safety for human consumption. 
As described above, the liquid concentrates are formulated according to the desired properties of the aqueous liquid dilution compositions containing the concentrates.
<br/><br/> a. Clarity
<br/><br/> In one example, the aqueous liquid dilution compositions are clear aqueous liquid dilution compositions or non-turbid aqueous liquid dilution compositions, for example, as determined, as described below, empirically or by measuring turbidity
and/or particle size.  In another example, the aqueous liquid dilution compositions are not clear, or not completely clear.  The liquids can be more or less clear, or have the same clarity as another liquid, for example, an aqueous liquid dilution
composition made according to the provided methods or a beverage, for example, a beverage that does not contain the diluted concentrate.  Properties of the liquid concentrates can affect the clarity of the liquid.  A number of parameters can vary the
clarity of the liquids, for example, the relative concentration of surfactant, non-polar compound and/or water; the type of non-polar ingredient; the concentration of excipient(s) in the particular non-polar compound; and the purity of the non-polar
compound, for example, whether it has been standardized to a high purity, or whether it is an extract or a filtered extract.  For example, an aqueous liquid dilution composition made by diluting a concentrate containing a non-polar active ingredient that
contains lecithin, for example a high amount of lecithin, can be less clear than one made with a concentrate containing a non-polar compound that does not contain lecithin.  In another example, a liquid concentrate containing a non-polar compound that is
a filtered extract can produce a clearer aqueous liquid dilution composition when diluted than a concentrate containing a crude extract.
<br/><br/> i. Clarity Determined by Empirical Evaluation
<br/><br/> In one example, the clarity/turbidity of the aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the diluted concentrate is evaluated qualitatively, by observation.  In one example, a liquid can be considered clear if it does not have a cloudy
appearance and/or if no or few particles are visible when viewing the liquid with the naked eye or if it is the same or substantially similar in clarity to another liquid, for example, a beverage, for example, water, fruit juice, soda or milk.  In some
cases, the aqueous liquid dilution composition is as clear or about as clear as water or another liquid, for example a beverage.  For example, the liquid (containing the liquid concentrate diluted in an aqueous medium, for example, a beverage) can be as
clear or about as clear as the aqueous medium not containing the liquid concentrate.  In a related example, there is no substantial difference, for example, no observable difference, between the aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the
concentrate and the aqueous medium without the concentrate.  A clear liquid is not necessarily colorless, for example, a yellow liquid that contains no visible particles or cloudiness can be considered clear.  In another example, the liquid is clear or
partially clear or substantially clear if no crystals are visible and/or if no "ringing" is observed on the container containing the liquid.
<br/><br/> ii.  Clarity Determined by Particle Size or Number of Particles
<br/><br/> In another example, clarity of the aqueous liquid dilution composition is evaluated by measuring the particle size and/or number of particles of the liquid.
<br/><br/> In one example, the aqueous liquid dilution compositions have a particle size less than 200 nm or less than about 200 nm, for example, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48,
49, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or 200 nm.  In another example, the aqueous liquid dilution composition has a particle size less than 100 nm or about 100 nm, less than 50 nm or about 50 nm or less than 25 nm or
about 25 nm.  Typically, the particle size of the aqueous liquid dilution composition is between 5 nm or about 5 nm and 200 nm or about 200 nm, or between 5 nm or about 5 nm and 50 nm or about 50 nm.
<br/><br/> Typically, the particle size of the provided aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the liquid concentrate, which contains the non-polar compound, is smaller than the particle size of a liquid containing the non-polar compound (not
formulated in a liquid concentrate).
<br/><br/> iii.  Turbidity
<br/><br/> In another example, the clarity of the liquid is evaluated and/or expressed using a turbidity measurement, for example, Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU), as measured using the provided methods, described below.  In this example, turbidity is
measured optically, to get value indicating the cloudiness or haziness of the liquid, which correlates with particles in suspension in the liquid.  The more clear a liquid is, the lower its turbidity value.
<br/><br/> In one example, the clear aqueous liquid dilution composition has a turbidity value (NTU) of 30 or about 30; or an NTU value of less than 30 or about 30, for example, less than 29 or about 29, less than 28 or about 28, less than 27 or about 27,
less than 26 or about 26, less than 25 or about 25, less than 24 or about 24, less than 23 or about 23, less than 22 or about 22, less than 21 or about 21, less than 20 or about 20, less than 19 or about 19, less than 18 or about 18, less than 17 or
about 17, less than 16 or about 16, less than 15 or about 15, less than 14 or about 14, less than 13 or about 13, less than 12 or about 12, less than 11 or about 11, less than 10 or about 10, less than 9 or about 9, less than 8 or about 8, less than 7 or
about 7, less than 6 or about 6, less than 5 or about 5, less than 4 or about 4, less than 3 or about 3, less than 2 or about 2, less than 1 or about 1; or 29 or about 29, 28 or about 28, 27 or about 27, 26 or about 26, 25 or about 25, 24 or about 24, 23
or about 23, 22 or about 22, 21 or about 21, 20 or about 20, 19 or about 19, 18 or about 18, 17 or about 17, 16 or about 16, 15 or about 15, 14 or about 14, 13 or about 13, 12 or about 12, 11 or about 11, 10 or about 10, 9 or about 9, 8 or about 8, 7 or
about 7, 6 or about 6, 5 or about 5, 4 or about 4, 3 or about 3, 2 or about 2, 1 or about 1, or 0 or about 0.
<br/><br/> In another example, the turbidity value of the aqueous liquid dilution composition is less than 200 or less than about 200, for example, 200, 175, 150, 100, 50, 25 or less.
<br/><br/> In another example, it is desirable that the aqueous liquid dilution composition contains a turbidity value that is comparable, for example, about the same as, the same as, or less than or greater than, the turbidity value of another liquid, for
example, a beverage not containing the liquid concentrate or an aqueous liquid dilution composition made by the provided methods.
<br/><br/> b. Stability
<br/><br/> Typically, the provided aqueous liquid dilution compositions containing the concentrates are stable, for example, free from one or more changes over a period of time, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 or
more years.
<br/><br/> In one example, the compositions are stable because they are free from oxidation or substantial oxidation over time.  In another example, they are stable because they remain clear over time.  In another example, the stable compositions remain
safe and/or desirable for human consumption over time.  In one example, stability refers to the lack of precipitates forming in the compositions over the period of time.  In a related example, the compositions are stable because they do not exhibit
"ringing," formation of a whitish or opaque ring around the perimeter of the container holding the liquid, typically at the surface of the liquid.  Ringing typically is undesirable, particularly in the case of a liquid for human consumption, for example,
a beverage.
<br/><br/> In another example, the composition is stable if it does not exhibit any visible phase separation over a period of time, for example, after 24 hours, after one week or after one month.  In one example, the compositions are stable if they exhibit
one or more of these described characteristics, over time, when kept at a particular temperature.  In one example, the compositions remain stable at room temperature, for example, 25.degree.  C. or about 25.degree.  C. In another example, the
compositions remain stable at between 19.degree.  C. and 25.degree.  C. In another example, the compositions remain stable at refrigerated temperatures, for example, 4.degree.  C. or about 4.degree.  C., or at frozen temperature, for example, at
-20.degree.  C. or about -20.degree.  C.
<br/><br/> Stability refers to a desirable property of the provided compositions, for example, the ability of the provided compositions to remain free from one or more changes over a period of time, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12
months, 1, 2, 3, 4 or more years.  In one example, the composition is stable if it is formulated such that it remains free from oxidation or substantial oxidation over time.  In another example, the stable compositions remain clear over time.  In another
example, the stable compositions remain safe and/or desirable for human consumption over time.  In one example, stability refers to the lack of precipitates forming in the compositions over the period of time.  In a related example, stability refers to
the lack of "ringing" over the period of time.  In another example, the composition is stable if it does not exhibit any visible phase separation over a period of time, for example, after 24 hours, after one week or after one month.  In one example, the
compositions are stable if they exhibit one or more of these described characteristics, over time, when kept at a particular temperature.
<br/><br/> In one example, the compositions are stable at room temperature, for example, 25.degree.  C. or about 25.degree.  C. In another example, the compositions remain stable at between 19.degree.  C. and 25.degree.  C. In another example, the
compositions remain stable at refrigerated temperatures, for example, 4.degree.  C. or about 4.degree.  C., or at frozen temperature, for example, at -20.degree.  C. or about -20.degree.  C.
<br/><br/> c. Desirable Characteristics for Human Consumption
<br/><br/> In one example, the liquid dilution composition is desirable for human consumption, for example, for use in a food or beverage.  Different properties of the liquid dilution composition can contribute to its desirability as a consumable product. 
For example, taste, smell, clarity, color, crystal formation, precipitation and "ringing," all can relate to desirability.
<br/><br/> In one example, the liquid dilution composition has a pleasant taste and/or smell, for example, due to one or more flavors added to the concentrate and/or to the aqueous medium.  In another example, the liquid dilution composition containing the
concentrate is free from an unpleasant taste or smell, for example, a "fishy" taste or smell.  In one example, the concentrate smells or tastes less unpleasant, for example, fishy, compared to another aqueous liquid dilution composition.
<br/><br/> In another example, the aqueous liquid dilution composition is desirable because it does not have crystals or has fewer crystals compared with another aqueous liquid dilution composition.  In another example, the aqueous liquid dilution
composition is desirable because it does not exhibit ringing.
<br/><br/> d. Safety
<br/><br/> Typically, the aqueous liquid dilution compositions containing the concentrates are safe for human consumption, for example, containing only ingredients approved by the FDA for human consumption, for example GRAS-certified ingredients.  In one
example, one or more of the ingredients, for example, all the ingredients, are Kosher-certified.  Safety of the compositions also relates to stability over time.  Lack of or minimum oxidation of the compositions over time can contribute to the safety of
the compositions.
<br/><br/> e. Oral Bioavailability
<br/><br/> In one example, the non-polar compounds, for example, the non-polar active ingredients, contained in the aqueous liquid dilution compositions exhibit a high or relatively high bioavailability, for example, a bioavailability that is higher than a
liquid containing the non-polar active ingredient alone (i.e., not formulated in the liquid concentrate).  Bioavailability relates to the ability of the body to absorb the non-polar active ingredient into a particular space, tissue cell and/or cellular
compartment.  Typically, non-polar active ingredients in liquids having small particle sizes are better absorbed than those with larger particle sizes.
<br/><br/> C. Methods for Making Liquid Nanoemulsion Concentrates Containing Non-polar Compounds
<br/><br/> Also provided are methods for making the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates.  General equipment and steps of the methods are detailed below.  In one example, the general methods for making the concentrates are performed using a bench-top
manufacturing process, which is used for making relatively smaller-sized batches of the concentrates.  In another example, the general methods for making the concentrates are performed using a scaled-up manufacturing processes, which is used for making
relatively larger batches of the concentrates.  The bench-top process can be scaled up to the scaled-up process.  Any concentrate made using the bench-top method can be made using the scaled-up process, by scaling up the method.
<br/><br/> 1.  Equipment for Making the Concentrates
<br/><br/> Various equipment, for example, vessels for mixing the oil phase, water phase and emulsion, for example, tanks; scales; mixers, including standard mixers and homogenizers; heating and cooling apparatuses, including water-jacketed tanks, hot
plates, water baths and chillers (coolers), including recirculating coolers; transfer apparatuses, for example, transfer means, for example, pumps, hoses, sanitary fittings; ball valves; purifiers, for example, filters, for example, carbon filters, ion
exchange equipment, reverse osmosis equipment, end-point filters and end product filters; evaluation means, for example, pH and temperature meters; and other equipment, is used in various steps of the provided methods for making the concentrates.  The
choice of equipment depends on a plurality of factors, including batch size and manufacturing process.
<br/><br/> 2.  Scales
<br/><br/> One or more scales typically is used to measure the ingredients before adding them to the appropriate vessel.  Alternatively, the ingredients can be weighed in the vessel, for example, in a tank on top of a scale.
<br/><br/> Any of a plurality of well-known, commercially sold scales can be used to weigh the ingredients.  Choice of scale(s) can depend on a number of factors, including the mass of the final concentrate being made and the ingredient being weighed.  In
one example, multiple scales are used to weigh the various ingredients of the concentrate.  In general, relatively larger capacity (weight) scale(s) are used in making larger batches of concentrate while relatively smaller capacity scale(s) are used in
making smaller batches.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the scales used with the provided methods to weigh the ingredients are a Toledo Scale (Model GD13x/USA), a Sartorius Basic Analytical Scale (Model BA110S) which is a basic series analytical scale with a 110 g capacity and a
resolution of 0.1 mg; and an OHAUS Scale (Model CS2000), which is a compact portable digital scale having a 2000 g capacity and a resolution of 1 g.
<br/><br/> a. Purifiers, Including Filters
<br/><br/> Purifiers, typically more than one purifier, for example, filters, are used in the provided methods to remove impurities in the ingredients prior to their addition to the concentrate and/or from the final concentrate and/or an intermediate phase
of the concentrate.  For example, when the polar solvent is water, the water typically is purified water.  In one example, one or more purifiers, for example, carbon filters, ion exchange purifiers, reverse osmosis purifiers, and/or end point filters are
used to filter water, for example, city water, prior to its addition to the water phase, for example, to remove impurities, for example, sediment, from the water.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the purifiers that can be used with the provided methods are filters, for example, 100 micron filters and carbon filters, which are filters that use activated carbon to remove impurities by chemical adsorption.  Carbon filtering
typically is used for water purification and are particularly effective at filtering out chlorine, sediment, volatile organic compounds and other impurities.  Typically, the particles removed by carbon filters are between about 0.5 microns and about 50
microns.  Other filters are well known and can be used with the provided methods.
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of the purifiers that can be used in the provided methods are reverse osmosis purifiers, which use mechanical pressure to purify liquids, for example, water.  In one example, the pressure forces the water through a semi-permeable
membrane to remove impurities.
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of the purifiers that can be used in the provided methods are ion exchange purifiers, for example, an ion exchange purifier using a resin bed, for example, a zeolite resin bed, to replace salts, e.g., cations, for example,
magnesium and calcium, with other cations, for example, sodium and potassium cations.  Such purifiers can be purchased, for example, from Aquapure Filters, Clarkston, Mich.
<br/><br/> In another example, an end product filter (e.g., a 100 micron FSI filter, Product Number BPEM 100-5GP).  This filter is used to filter any impurities out of the final product (e.g., the final liquid nanoemulsion composition).  Other filters are
known and can be used with the provided methods.
<br/><br/> b. Vessels for Mixing the Ingredients
<br/><br/> One or more, typically two or more, vessels, for example, tanks, for example, water-jacketed tanks; pots; and/or beakers, for example, Pyrex.RTM.  beakers, are used in the provided methods to contain the ingredient(s) of the liquid concentrates,
for example, during mixing and/or heating or cooling.  Typically, separate vessels (an oil phase tank and a water phase tank) are used for mixing and heating the ingredients of the oil phase and the water phase, prior to combining the two phases to form
an emulsion.  In another example, an additional vessel, for example, a holding and/or packaging tank, is used for holding and/or packaging the emulsion and/or for addition/mixing of additional ingredients to the emulsion.
<br/><br/> A number of vessels are available for mixing ingredients.  Typically, the vessels are cleaned, for example, rinsed, soaped and/or sanitized according to known procedures, prior to use and between uses.
<br/><br/> In one example, typically used with the bench-top process, the vessel is a container, for example, a bench-top container, for example, flasks, beakers, for example, Pyrex.RTM.  beakers, vials, measuring containers, bottles and/or other bench-top
containers.
<br/><br/> In another example, typically used with the scaled-up manufacturing process, the vessels are tanks, for example, water phase tanks, oil phase tanks and holding/packaging tanks.  Typically, the tanks are equipped with one or more mixers, for
example, a standard mixer and/or homogenizer, which are used to mix the ingredients added to the tank.  In one example, the tank further is equipped with a heating and/or cooling device.  For example, the tank can be a water-jacketed tank.  The
temperature of the water-jacketed tank is controlled through the water-jacket, for example, to heat the contents, for example, while mixing.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of the tanks that can be used with the provided methods are water-jacketed tanks, for example, the Overly 550 Gallon water jacketed tank (Model 10576501G), which has a 550 gallon capacity and typically is used as a water-phase tank,
the Schweitzers 450 gallon tank (Model #5214-C), which has a 450 gallon capacity and typically is used as an oil phase tank and the Royal 190 gallon water jacketed tank (Model 9977-5), which has a 190 gallon capacity and can be used as a water or oil
phase tank when mixing smaller volumes.  Other tanks are well known and can be used with the provided methods for mixing the concentrates, for example, the phases of the concentrates.
<br/><br/> c. Mixers
<br/><br/> Mixers are used in the provided methods to blend, mix and/or emulsify the liquid concentrates and/or various ingredients and/or phases of the liquid concentrates.  In one example, the mixers are used to keep the ingredients and/or mixture
circulating to maintain temperature, viscosity and/or other parameters of the mixture.  Exemplary of the mixers that can be used in the provided methods are standard mixers, for example, standard mixers, which can be used, for example, to mix the
ingredients in the water and/or oil phases, to maintain a homogeneous mixture while heating.  Exemplary of the standard mixers is a LIGHTNIN.RTM.  mixer (LIGHTNIN, Rochester, N.Y.), for example, Model Numbers XJC117 and ND-2.  In one example, the
LIGHTNIN.RTM.  mixers are fixed-mount, gear drive high-flow mixers, for use with closed tanks.  Another example of a standard mixer is a mixer sold by IKA.RTM., for example, overhead IKA.RTM.  mixers, for example, model Nos.  RW-14 Basic and RE-16S,
which are laboratory stirrers and can be used to mix ingredients, for example, to generate the oil and water phases.  In one example, the mixer(s) are attached to the vessels, for example, the tanks, for example, mounted or clamped onto the tanks, for
example, the top of the tanks.  In another example, the mixers are placed in the vessels for mixing.
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of the mixers used with the provided methods are homogenizers (also called shears), which typically are used to form the emulsion by emulsifying the oil and water phases after they are combined.  The homogenizers typically provide
high shear dispersion of solids and emulsification of immiscible liquids at high shear rates.  Exemplary of the homogenizers that can be used in the provided methods are high-shear homogenizers, for example, reverse homogenizers sold by Arde Barinco,
Inc., Norwood, N.J., for example, Model CJ-50, which is a 3600 rpm mixer having a 6 inch rotor diameter, a tip speed of 5575 ft/minute and an emersion depth of 33 inches and has six separate openings at the bottom and top, which concentrates the liquid
into six chambers, reducing the surface volume and creating a shear effect; and Model CJ-4E, which is a 10,000 rpm mixer with fan-cooled motor, optimized for 1 to 5 gallon batch sizes, having a 1.875 inch rotor diameter, a tip speed of 4920 rpm and an
immersion depth of 16 inches.  Other homogenizers, for example, other reversible homogenizers sold by Arde Barinco Inc., can be used with the provided methods.
<br/><br/> In one example, the homogenizer is attached to the top of the vessel, for example, the tank, for example, by clamps or by channel locks and an electrical hoist.  In another example, the homogenizer is placed in the vessel.  The Arde Barinco
reversible homogenizers contain axial flow impellers, which create two distinct mixing actions, depending on direction.  Downward "vortex flow" pulls solids from top and bottom of the mixture, while upward "umbrella flow" controls mixing at the highest
shear and recirculation rates without splashing or incorporation of air.  The reversible homogenizers typically are equipped with an adjustable baffle plate, which can be adjusted to control the type of mixing, for example at different times during
emulsification.
<br/><br/> A number of additional mixers are well known and can be used with the provided methods.  Exemplary of the mixers that can be used with the provided methods are shears, inline mixers/mixing, Ribbon, Plow/Paddle Blenders Forberg Mixers, Conveyors,
Bag Dumps &amp; Compactors, V-Blenders, Blade Mixers, Double Cone Mixers, Continuous Mixers, Speedflow Mixers, Batch Mixers, Double Ribbon Blenders, Paddle and Ribbon Mixers with Choppers, Plow Blenders/Turbulent Mixers, Fluidizing Forberg-Type Mixers, Air
Mixers, Active Mixers, Passive Mixers, Top Entry Mixers, Side Entry Mixers, Static Mixers, Fixed Entry Mixers, Portable Mixers--direct and gear drive, Sanitary Mixers, Drum Mixers, Bulk Container (IBC) Mixers, Lab Stirrers, Variable Speed Mixers, dough

<br/><br/> d. Heating Apparatuses
<br/><br/> One or more, typically more than one, heating apparatuses are used in the provided methods to control the temperature of the ingredients, phases and/or concentrate, typically while mixing.
<br/><br/> In one example, the heating apparatuses are water-jackets.  In this example, the vessels used to mix the ingredients and/or emulsify the phases are water jacketed tanks.  The water jacket can be controlled, for example, using a control panel, to
adjust the temperature of the contents of the vessel.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, other heating apparatuses can be used to heat the ingredients, phases, and/or concentrates.  Exemplary of heating apparatuses that can be used with the provided methods are immersible and/or submersible heaters, for example, 12 KW
or 13 KW sanitary heaters, which are food-grade heaters that are immersed into the tanks while mixing, typically for applications requiring high heat, for example, temperatures greater than 60.degree.  C. or about 60.degree.  C., or greater than
80.degree.  C. or about 80.degree.  C. Also exemplary of heating apparatuses are stoves, for example, propane stoves.  Also exemplary of the heating apparatuses are hot plates, for example, the Thermolyne hot plate, model number 846925 and model number
SP46615.  Typically, the heater is capable of heating the mixture to between 45.degree.  C. or about 45.degree.  C. and 85.degree.  C. or about 85.degree.  C., for example, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64,
65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84 or 85.degree.  C. Typically, the heater is capable of heating the mixture to 60.degree.  C. or about 60.degree.  C., for example, providing low heat.
<br/><br/> e. Cooling Apparatuses
<br/><br/> One or more cooling apparatuses can be used with the provided methods, for example, to cool the ingredients during mixing, for example, to chill the mixture while emulsifying the oil and water phases.  Exemplary of the cooling apparatuses are
chillers, for example, recirculating coolers, which can be attached to the vessel, for example, remotely or by a tank mounted in the cooler, to recirculate fluid from the tank, through the chiller and back to the tank, in order to rapidly cool and
maintain the temperature of the mixture during mixing.  Exemplary of an open-loop chiller that can be attached to the tank and used with the provided methods are chillers sold by Turmoil, West Swanzey, N.H., for example, open or closed-loop coolers, for
example, model No. OC-1000 RO.  Other cooling apparatuses are well known and can be used with the provided methods.
<br/><br/> Also exemplary of the cooling apparatuses are water baths and ice baths, for example, water baths and/or ice baths in which the vessel(s) are placed, for example, during homogenizing.
<br/><br/> Typically, the cooling apparatus can be used to cool the liquid to between 25.degree.  C. or about 25.degree.  C. and 45.degree.  C. or about 45.degree.  C., for example, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42,
43, 44 or 45.degree.  C., typically between 25.degree.  C. and 43.degree.  C., typically between 35.degree.  C. and 43.degree.  C., for example, 26.5.degree.  C. Typically, the cooling is rapid cooling, for example, cooling to between 25.degree.  C. or
about 25.degree.  C. and 45.degree.  C. or about 45.degree.  C., for example, between 35.degree.  C. and 43.degree.  C., for example, 26.5.degree.  C., in between 15 minutes or about 15 minutes and 2 hours or about 2 hours, typically, between 30 minutes
or about 30 minutes and 60 minutes or about 60 minutes, for example, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 or 60 minutes.
<br/><br/> f. Transfer Means
<br/><br/> Transfer means are used with the provided methods to transfer liquid from one vessel to another vessel, for example, to transfer the contents of one or more vessels to one or more other vessels, for example, to transfer the water phase to the
oil phase vessel (e.g., the oil phase tank) or to transfer the oil phase to the water phase vessel (e.g., the water phase tank), in order to form the emulsion.  Exemplary of the equipment used for the transfer means are transfer pumps and associated
accessories, for example, ball valves, sanitary fittings (for example, sanitary fittings sold by Granger, Inc., Lake Forrest Ill.) and transfer hoses (for example, hoses sold by Sani-Tech West, Oxnard, Calif.), for example, food grade hoses attached to
the transfer pumps.  Exemplary of the transfer pumps that can be used with the provided methods is the Teel Pump (Model 2P377B), Granger, Inc.  Lake Forrest II, a self-priming pump having a power rating of 2 HP, 60 Hz voltage 208-230/460 AC, speed of
3450 rpm.  Other pumps, for example, other self-priming pumps from Grainger, Inc., can be used as part of the transfer means in the provided methods.  Alternatively, transfer means can include means for manually transferring the liquid to another vessel,
for example, by pouring, pipetting and/or other well-known methods of manually transferring liquids.
<br/><br/> g. Evaluation Equipment
<br/><br/> Evaluation equipment is used to evaluate one or more properties of the compositions, for example, the phases of the compositions and/or the final concentrates.  For example, evaluation equipment can be used to measure one or more parameters of
the concentrates and/or the phases, for example, the temperature and the pH of the liquids.  Exemplary of the evaluation equipment are pH meters and temperature meters.  Exemplary of the pH/temperature meters is the pH and temperature meter sold by Hanna
Instruments, (model number HI 8314), which can be used to measure the temperature and the pH of the mixture(s).  Also exemplary of temperature meters are temperature probes, for example, digital and/or water-proof temperature probes, for example,
temperature probes sold by Cooper-Atkins, Middlefield, Conn., for example, the digital waterproof temperature probe (Model # DPP400W) from Cooper-Atkins.  Other evaluation equipment for evaluating liquids and/or emulsions is well known and can be used
with the provided methods.
<br/><br/> 3.  General Methods for Making the Liquid Nanoemulsion Concentrates
<br/><br/> In general, the provided methods for making the concentrates include steps for generating phases (e.g., oil phase(s) and water phase(s)) and steps for combining and emulsifying the phases, to form the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates.  In some
examples, the methods include additional steps, such as evaluation, addition of further ingredients, packaging and filtering.  The provided methods can be performed using a bench-top manufacturing process (typically for small batch sizes). 
Alternatively, the methods can be performed using a scaled-up manufacturing process (typically for larger batch sizes).  Each of the provided concentrates can be made using either a scaled-up process or a bench-top process.  In one example, after the
concentrate first is made using the bench-top process, the method is scaled up to make larger quantities of the concentrate using the scaled-up process.  When formulating the concentrates according to the provided methods, the initial concentrate
typically is made by a bench-top method.  In one example of the formulation methods, a selected formulation then is made using a scaled-up process.  Any of the concentrates provided herein can be made with the provided methods, using either manufacturing
process.  Any method described herein, where the bench-top method is used, can be scaled-up for production of the concentrates using the scaled-up process.
<br/><br/> Generally, the provided methods for making the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates include first generation steps, whereby one or more oil phases and one or more water phases are produced.  Generation of the water phase and generation of the oil
phase typically are performed in at least two separate vessels, for example, an oil phase vessel and a water phase vessel.  Each of the generation steps typically includes a mixing step and a heating step, which can be performed simultaneously,
sequentially in any order, or partially simultaneously.
<br/><br/> To generate the water phase, water phase ingredient(s) (e.g., the polar solvent (e.g., water, propylene glycol, glycerin or other polar solvent) and, in some examples, additional water phase ingredients) are added to a water phase vessel.  The
ingredient(s) are mixed, typically using a standard mixer, and heated, for example, using a heating apparatus.  Typically, the water phase ingredients are heated to a low heat temperature, for example, to 60.degree.  C. or about 60.degree.  C. To make
the oil phase, the oil phase ingredients (e.g., non-polar compound(s), surfactant(s) and, in some examples, other oil phase ingredient(s)) are added to an oil phase vessel.  The oil phase ingredient(s) are mixed, typically using a standard mixer, and
heated, for example, using a heating apparatus.  Typically, the ingredients are heated to a low heat temperature, for example, to 60.degree.  C. or about 60.degree.  C. The mixing/heating of the water and oil phase can be performed simultaneously or
sequentially, in any order.  In one example, generation of the oil phase is performed subsequently to generation of the water phase, for example, to preserve the non-polar active ingredient, for example, to prevent its oxidation.  Typically, both phases
are heated to the desired temperature, for example, low heat temperature, and/or until the ingredients dissolve, prior to combining the oil and the water phases in a subsequent emulsification step.
<br/><br/> In general, the methods further include an emulsifying step.  For the emulsifying step, the oil and water phases are combined, for example, using one or more transfer means.  The oil and water phases are emulsified, typically with mixing,
typically homogenizing, for example, using high shear, in order to generate an emulsion (e.g., the liquid nanoemulsion concentrate).  The emulsifying step can be performed in the water phase vessel, the oil phase vessel, or a separate vessel.
<br/><br/> Typically, during the emulsifying step, the forming emulsion is cooled, for example, rapidly cooled, for example, using one or more cooling apparatuses.  Typically, the cooling step is performed simultaneously with the emulsifying step.  In one
example, the cooling is performed until the emulsion reaches a temperature of between 25.degree.  C. or about 25.degree.  C. and 43.degree.  C. or about 43.degree.  C.
<br/><br/> The provided methods can include additional steps, for example, evaluation steps, steps for adding additional ingredients, purification (e.g., filtration) steps, and/or packaging/holding steps, as detailed below.
<br/><br/> a. Generating the Water Phase
<br/><br/> Typically the water phase ingredients are weighed and/or measured, for example, using one or more scales (e.g., one or more of the scales described herein), before addition to the water phase vessel (e.g., any vessel described herein).  In one
example, the amount of each ingredient to be added to the water phase vessel is determined according to the provided methods for formulating the concentrates.  Typically, the desired concentration, by weight (w/w), of the final nanoemulsion concentrate
is used to calculate the amount of each water phase ingredient that is added to the water phase vessel.  Alternatively, the desired volume per weight, volume per volume or weight per volume can be used to calculate the correct amount of an ingredient to
be measured and added to the vessel.
<br/><br/> In one example, when water is the polar solvent, impurities in the water, for example, city water, are removed using one or more purifiers (e.g., one or more purifiers as described herein) above, before adding the water to the water phase tank. 
In one example, the water is purified by passage through using the following purifiers, sequentially: a carbon filter, an ion exchange purifier, a reverse osmosis purifier and an end-point filter, for example, a 100 micron end-point filter, before being
added to the water phase vessel.
<br/><br/> Typically, the water phase ingredient(s) are mixed in the water phase vessel using a standard mixer (e.g., any of the standard mixers described herein) and heated, typically simultaneously or, in part, simultaneously, using a heating apparatus
(e.g., any of the heating apparatuses described herein).  Typically, the water phase is heated such that the water phase ingredients reach a low heat temperature, for example, between about between 45.degree.  C. or about 45.degree.  C. and 85.degree. 
C. or about 85.degree.  C., for example, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84 or 85.degree.  C., typically, 60.degree.  C. or about
60.degree.  C., for example, to prevent oxidation of the non-polar ingredients and/or maintain the stability of the ingredients.  Typically, mixing and/or heating of water phase ingredients in the water phase vessel is continued, for example, prior to
combining the water phase and the oil phase.  In one example, the water phase is mixed and/or heated until the water phase ingredients have dissolved.  Typically, the temperature of the water phase is maintained with mixing prior to combining the oil and
water phases.
<br/><br/> i. Water Phase Ingredients
<br/><br/> The water phase includes one or more polar solvent, such as water, diols, such as propylene glycol and sugar alcohols, such as glycerin, and, in some examples includes other water phase ingredients.  Typically, water phase ingredients are
hydrophilic and/or amphipathic ingredients of the liquid nanoemulsion concentrate.  For example, oils and other lipophilic ingredients typically are not added to the water phase.  Certain ingredients, for example, ingredients having hydrophobic and
hydrophilic moieties, for example, surfactants and co-surfactants, can be added to either the oil or the water phase, or to the oil and the water phase.  Exemplary water phase ingredients include, but are not limited to, polar solvents, e.g., water,
typically filtered water, propylene glycol, glycerin and other diols; emulsion stabilizers; pH adjusters, for example, phosphoric acid and/or citric acid; flavors; surfactants; co-surfactants, for example, phosphatidylcholine and/or quillaja saponin; and
preservatives.
<br/><br/> Water phase ingredients can be added to the water phase simultaneously and/or sequentially, in a specific order.  In one example, one or more water phase ingredients is added first and heated, prior to addition of further ingredient(s).  In one
example, when the water phase ingredients include a polar solvent and an emulsion stabilizer, these ingredients are added sequentially, in the following order: 1) polar solvent; 2) emulsion stabilizer.  In one example, when the water phase ingredients
include water and an emulsion stabilizer, these ingredients are added sequentially, in the following order: 1) water; 2) emulsion stabilizer.  In another example, when the water phase ingredients include a surfactant, a polar solvent (e.g., water) and an
emulsion stabilizer, these ingredients are added to the water phase vessel sequentially, in the following order: 1) surfactant; 2) polar solvent (e.g., water); 3) emulsion stabilizer.  Alternatively, the water phase ingredients can be added in any other
order.  Typically, when the water phase includes a surfactant, particularly when the surfactant is a surfactant that is solid at room temperature, for example, the surfactant is the first water phase ingredient added to the water phase vessel. 
Typically, when the water phase ingredients include an emulsion stabilizer, the emulsion stabilizer is the last ingredient added to the water phase vessel.
<br/><br/> b. Generating the Oil Phase
<br/><br/> Typically the oil phase ingredient(s) are weighed and/or measured, for example, using one or more scales (e.g., one or more of the scales described herein), before addition to the oil phase vessel (e.g., any of the vessels described herein).  In
one example, the amount of each oil phase ingredient to be added is determined according to the provided methods for formulating the concentrates.  Typically, the desired concentration, by weight (w/w), of the final nanoemulsion concentrate is used to
calculate the amount of each oil phase ingredient that should be added to the oil phase vessel.  Alternatively, the volume per weight, volume per volume or weight per volume can be used to calculate the correct amount of an ingredient to be measured and
added to the vessel.
<br/><br/> Typically, the oil phase ingredients are mixed in the oil phase vessel using a standard mixer (e.g., any of the standard mixers described herein) and heated, typically simultaneously, using a heating apparatus (e.g., any of the heating
apparatuses described herein).  Typically, the oil phase is heated such that it reaches a low heat temperature, for example, between 45.degree.  C. or about 45.degree.  C. and 85.degree.  C. or about 85.degree.  C., for example, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50,
51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84 or 85.degree.  C., typically 60.degree.  C. or about 60.degree.  C., for example, to prevent oxidation of the non-polar
ingredients and/or maintain the stability of the ingredients.  In one example, one or more of the oil phase ingredients are mixed and heated according to the provided methods, prior to addition of the rest of the oil phase ingredients.  For example, the
non-polar compound can be mixed and heated with one or more solvent, for example, an oil, for example, flaxseed oil and/or Vitamin E oil, until the non-polar compound is dissolved in the oil, prior to addition of the other oil ingredients.  Typically,
the oil phase ingredients are mixed in the oil phase vessel until dissolved.  Typically, the temperature of the oil phase is maintained with mixing prior to combining the oil and water phases.
<br/><br/> In some examples the oil and/or the water phase can be made in more than one vessels, for example, by mixing one or more of the oil phase ingredients in one vessel and mixing the one or more other oil ingredients in another vessel.  In this
example, the mixed oil phase ingredients in the separate vessels either can be mixed together prior to emulsifying with the water phase, or alternatively, can be added separately, during emulsification, to the water phase.
<br/><br/> i. Oil Phase Ingredients
<br/><br/> The oil phase includes the non-polar compound, for example, the non-polar active ingredient and, in some examples, other oil phase ingredients.  Typically, oil phase ingredients include one or more lipophilic and/or amphipathic ingredients of
the liquid nanoemulsion concentrate.  Oil phase ingredients typically do not include aqueous ingredients or hydrophilic ingredients.  Certain ingredients, for example, ingredients having hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties, for example, surfactants and
co-surfactants, can be added to either the oil or the water phase, or to the oil and the water phase.  Exemplary of ingredients used in the oil phase of the provided concentrates are non-polar compounds, for example, non-polar active ingredients,
including any of the non-polar active ingredients provided herein; emulsion stabilizers, pH adjusters, for example, phosphoric acid and/or citric acid; surfactants; co-surfactants, for example, phosphatidylcholine and/or quillaja saponin; preservatives,
and oils, for example, solvents and other oil phase ingredients.
<br/><br/> Oil phase ingredients can be added to the oil phase simultaneously and/or sequentially, for example, in any order or in a specific order.  In one example, one or more oil phase ingredients is added first and heated, prior to addition of further
ingredient(s).  In one example, when the oil phase ingredients include a surfactant, a preservative, a solvent, a co-surfactant, and a non-polar compound, these ingredients are added sequentially, in the following order: 1) surfactant; 2) preservative;
3) solvent; 4) co-surfactant; 5) non-polar compound; and 6) emulsion stabilizer.  In another example, when the oil phase ingredients include a surfactant, a preservative and a non-polar compound, the ingredients are added sequentially, in the following
order: 1) surfactant; 2) preservative; 3) non-polar compound.  In another example, when the oil phase ingredients include a surfactant, a preservative, a non-polar compound and an emulsion stabilizer, the ingredients are added sequentially, in the
following order: 1) surfactant, 2) preservative; 3) non-polar compound; and 4) emulsion stabilizer.  Alternatively, the oil phase ingredients can be added in a different order, for example, any order.  Two or more oil phase ingredients can be added
simultaneously.
<br/><br/> Typically, when the oil phase includes a surfactant, particularly when the surfactant is a surfactant that is solid at room temperature, the surfactant is the first oil phase ingredient added to the oil phase vessel.  Typically, when the oil
phase ingredients include an emulsion stabilizer, the emulsion stabilizer is the last ingredient added to the oil phase vessel.  Typically, the non-polar compound either is the last ingredient added to the oil phase vessel, or is added immediately prior
to addition of the emulsion stabilizer, which is the last ingredient added to the oil phase vessel.
<br/><br/> c. Combining and Emulsifying the Oil Phase and the Water Phase
<br/><br/> Generally, in the provided methods, following the generation of the oil phase and the water phase, the oil and water phases are combined, for example, using one or more transfer means (e.g., any of the transfer means described herein).  The
combined phases are emulsified, for example, by mixing, for example, homogenizing, to form an emulsion (e.g., the liquid nanoemulsion concentrate).  Typically, the phases are mixed during the combining and the emulsifying steps, for example, using a
homogenizer (e.g., any of the homogenizers described herein).  In one example, the oil and water phases (e.g., the forming emulsion) further are cooled, for example, rapidly cooled, during the emulsifying and/or combining steps.
<br/><br/> i. Combining the Oil and Water Phases
<br/><br/> In order to emulsify them, the oil and water phases first are combined, typically by transfer, using one or more transfer means (e.g., any of the transfer means described herein).  In one example, the oil phase is transferred to the water phase
vessel.  In another example, the water phase is transferred to the oil phase vessel.  In another example, a plurality of oil phases or water phases are transferred to a water phase or an oil phase vessel.  In another example, the water phase(s) and the
oil phase(s) are transferred to another vessel, for example, an emulsification vessel.
<br/><br/> Any transfer means can be used to combine the phases.  For example, any means for transferring the contents of one vessel to another vessel as described above, for example, transfer pumps and associated equipment, for example, sanitary fittings,
hoses and/or ball valves; and manual transfer means, for example, pouring and/or pipetting means or other known transfer means.  In some examples, the phases are kept clean, for example, sterile during transfer, for example, by using transfer means with
sanitary fittings and/or combining the phases in a sterile environment.
<br/><br/> ii.  Emulsifying the Oil and Water Phases
<br/><br/> Simultaneous to and/or subsequent to the combination of the phases, the phases are mixed (e.g., homogenized), for example, using a homogenizer (e.g., any of the described homogenizer), to form an emulsion.  Typically, the emulsifying is
performed in the vessel containing the combined liquids, for example, the oil phase or the water phase vessel.  For this emulsifying step, the oil and water phases are mixed, for example, after the combining step, typically during and after the combining
step, using a mixer that is capable of emulsifying liquids, for example, a homogenizer, for example, a reversible homogenizer.  Typically, the liquids are homogenized using the mixer (e.g., homogenizer) at low speed, for example, low rpm, for example,
between 850 rpm or about 850 rpm and 1200 rpm or about 1200 rpm, for example, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150 or 1200 rpm.  Lower speeds can reduce the incorporation of air into the nanoemulsion.  In some examples, the homogenization can be
performed at speeds less than 850 rpm, such as, for example, between 25 or about 25 rpm and 50 rpm or about 50 rpm, for example at or about 30 rpm, to further reduce incorporation of air into the nanoemulsion.
<br/><br/> The liquids typically are mixed, continuously or intermittently, until the liquids are emulsified, for example, in a nanoemulsion.  In one example, the mixing speed is maintained in order to emulsify the oil and water phases.  In one example,
the baffle plate of the mixer is adjusted, for example, by moving the baffle plate further down into the mixture or further up out of the mixture, to control the type of mixing, for example, to switch from downward flow to upward flow and vice versa,
during mixing of the emulsion.  In another example, the homogenizer can be adjusted to increase or decrease shear or to maintain the shear at a particular speed.  Methods for homogenizing oil and water phases are well known and other methods can be used
to homogenize the oil and water phases in the provided methods.
<br/><br/> iii.  Cooling
<br/><br/> Typically, the emulsion is cooled during mixing, for example, by rapid cooling.  In one example, the emulsion is cooled to promote stability of the emulsion and emulsification of the phases, for example, by preventing or minimizing oxidization,
for example, oxidization of the non-polar compound.  The cooling, for example, rapid cooling, typically is performed using one or more cooling apparatuses, for example, any of the cooling apparatuses described herein or any known cooling apparatus.  In
one example, the cooling apparatus is a recirculating cooler.  In another example, the cooling apparatus is a water bath or an ice bath.  In one example, when the apparatus is a recirculating cooler, fluid from the vessel being used for the emulsifying
step is recirculated through the cooler, and then back to the vessel, to rapidly cool and maintain the temperature of the mixture during mixing.  Typically, the forming emulsion is mixed and cooled until the phases are emulsified and the temperature
reaches between 25.degree.  C. or about 25.degree.  C. and 43.degree.  C. or about 43.degree.  C., for example, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 or 43.degree.  C. Typically, when the cooling is rapid cooling, the
temperature is reached in less than 2 hours or about 2 hours, typically less than 1 hour or about 1 hour, for example, in at least between 30 minutes or about 30 minutes and 60 minutes or about 60 minutes, for example, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38,
39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 or 60 minutes.
<br/><br/> Once the oil and water phases have been emulsified, thereby forming an emulsion, for example, a liquid nanoemulsion concentrate, the emulsion can be used, for example, in the provided dilution methods to make a liquid dilution composition, for
example, a beverage, containing the concentrate.  Alternatively, one or more additional steps can be performed before using the concentrate.
<br/><br/> d. Additional Steps
<br/><br/> Typically, one or more additional steps is carried out, following emulsifying the phases, prior to use of the concentrate.  For example, the emulsion can be evaluated (e.g., by measuring pH and/or temperature of the concentrate).  In another
example, one or more additional ingredients can be added to the emulsion.  In another example, the nanoemulsion concentrate is transferred to a holding vessel or a packaging vessel, for example, a holding/packaging vessel, for example, a
holding/packaging tank.  In another example, the nanoemulsion is purified, for example, filtered, prior to use.  In one example, addition of additional ingredients, evaluation and/or purification, can be performed in the holding/packaging vessel.  Other
additional steps can be performed prior to use.
<br/><br/> i. Additional Ingredients
<br/><br/> In one example, additional ingredients, for example pH adjusters and/or flavors, can be added to the emulsion after it is formed.  In one example, citric acid and/or phosphoric acid is added to adjust the pH, for example, until the pH reaches a
pH between 2.5 and 3.5, typically, between 2.6 or about 2.6 and 3.2 or about 3.2, for example, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, or 3.2.  In another example, one or more flavors is added to the concentrate, for example, to improve the taste and/or smell of
the concentrate and/or beverages containing the concentrate.  In another example, additional polar solvent, e.g., water, can be added to the emulsion, for example, in the case of evaporation, to bring the concentrate to the appropriate volume.  Other
additional ingredients also can be added to the emulsion.  Typically, the additional ingredients are added to the vessel containing the emulsion, for example, the water phase vessel, the oil phase vessel, the emulsion vessel, or another vessel, for
example, a holding/packaging vessel.  Typically, the emulsion is mixed (e.g., using any of the described mixers, typically standard mixers), while the additional ingredients are added.
<br/><br/> ii.  Evaluation of the Concentrate
<br/><br/> Typically, the concentrate is evaluated prior to use.  Typically, the pH and/or temperature are measured, for example, using a pH and temperature meter.  In one example, the pH and/or temperature are evaluated after additional ingredients have
been added.  In one example, further ingredients can be added to adjust the parameters after evaluation.
<br/><br/> iii.  Filtering the Concentrate
<br/><br/> In one example, the concentrate is purified (e.g., with any of the described purifiers), for example, using an end product filter, prior to use of the concentrate, for example, prior to diluting the concentrate in an aqueous medium.
<br/><br/> 4.  Bench-Top Process
<br/><br/> In one example of the provided methods for making the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates, the steps of the methods are performed using a bench-top manufacturing process, which is performed on a bench, counter, table or other surface.  Typically,
the bench-top process is used to make emulsions having relatively smaller volumes than those made with the scaled-up process, for example, volumes less than 1 L or about 1 L or less than 1 gallon or about 1 gallon, for example, less than about 500 mL,
for example, 1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, 500, 450, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 50, or less.
<br/><br/> For the bench-top process, the equipment typically is sufficiently compact to be used on a bench top or other similar surface, typically sufficiently compact to be moved, for example, lifted, by the artisan using the methods.  For example, the
vessels, for example, water phase vessels, oil phase vessels, holding vessels, and packaging vessels typically are bench-top vessels, for example, flasks, beakers, vials, measuring containers, bottles and/or other bench-top containers.  In one example,
the vessels in the bench-top process is a Pyrex.RTM.  beaker.  Typically, the mixers are mixers that can be used in the bench-top vessels, for example, standard mixers, including hand-held mixers, stir rods, stir bars, magnetic mixers and overhead
mixers, for example, mechanical and/or electric overhead mixers and/or other mixers that can be used in the vessels.  Exemplary of appropriate bench-top mixers are standard mixers, for example, standard mixers sold by IKA.RTM., for example, overhead
IKA.RTM.  mixers, for example, model Nos.  RW-14 Basic and RE-16S, which are laboratory stirrers and can be used to mix ingredients, for example, to generate the oil and water phases.  Also exemplary of appropriate bench-top mixers are homogenizers, for
example, reversible homogenizers, including The Arde Barinco reversible homogenizer, Model no. CJ-4E, which can be used to emulsify the phases.  Typically, the heating apparatuses are those that can be used with the bench-top vessels, for example, hot
plates.  The cooling apparatuses typically are apparatuses suited for use with the smaller bench-top vessels, for example, ice baths and/or water baths into which the vessels can be placed, for example, for rapid cooling.  The evaluation means used in
the bench-top process, for example, the temperature and/or pH meters, typically are capable of being placed in the bench-top vessels.
<br/><br/> Generally, for the bench-top process, the oil phase and water phase are generated by mixing and heating in separate bench-top vessels, for example, flasks, beakers, vials, measuring containers, bottles and/or other bench-top containers.  The
mixing typically is performed using an appropriate bench-top mixer, for example, a standard mixer, such as a hand-held mixer, stir rod, stir bar, magnetic mixer and/or overhead mixer, for example, the mixer sold by IKA.RTM., for example, overhead
IKA.RTM.  mixers, for example, model Nos.  RW-14 Basic and RE-16S, which are laboratory stirrers.  Typically, heating the oil and water phases is performed using a heating apparatus appropriate to the bench-top method, for example, a heating apparatus
that one or more of the vessels can be placed upon, for example, a hot plate.  For combining the oil phase and the water phase, one or more phases, typically one phase, typically is transferred manually to another vessel, for example, by pouring,
pipetting and/or another manual transfer means.  For emulsifying the oil and water phases, a reverse homogenizer typically is used.  For cooling the forming emulsion, for example, for rapidly cooling the emulsion, a cooling apparatus appropriate to the
bench-top method typically is used, for example, a cooling apparatus that the vessel can be placed upon or inside, for example, a water bath or an ice bath.
<br/><br/> 5.  Scaled-Up Manufacturing Processes
<br/><br/> The provided methods for making the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates can be performed using a scaled-up manufacturing process.  A scaled-up manufacturing process typically is used when the liquid nanoemulsion concentrate being made has a
relatively larger volume than a concentrate being made with the bench-top process, for example, volumes greater than 1 L or about 1 L or greater than 1 gallon or about 1 gallon, for example, greater than about 500 mL, for example, at least 0.5 L, 1 L, 2
L, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 800, 900, 1000, or more gallons.
<br/><br/> In general, the scaled-up manufacturing processes are performed with equipment that is compatible with these larger volume batches (batch sizes).  For example, the vessels used in the scaled up process typically are tanks, e.g., water jacketed
tanks, which are equipped with water jackets that can be used as heating apparatuses to heat the oil and water phase ingredients during generation of the oil and water phases.  The water jackets typically are controlled via control panels.  Similarly,
the transfer means used in the scaled-up process typically include transfer pumps and associated fittings, for example, ball valves and hoses.  Exemplary of mixers that are used in the scaled-up process are standard mixers (for example, mounted mixers,
for example LIGHTNIN.RTM.  mixers, for example, Model XJC117 (a fixed-mount, gear drive high-flow mixer, and Model ND2.  An exemplary scaled-up process is set forth in FIG. 1 and described in this section, below.  The provided methods for making the
concentrates can be performed using this exemplary scaled-up process, or any variation of the scaled-up process, for example, eliminating one or more steps of the exemplary process, adding one or more steps according to the provided method, and/or
substituting steps and/or equipment according to the methods provided herein.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 sets forth a an exemplary scaled-up process 100 for making the liquid concentrate.  In this example, the polar solvent is water.  This exemplary scaled-up process includes the following steps:
<br/><br/> a. Water Purification
<br/><br/> As noted herein, the polar solvent can include water (including purified water) and other polar solvents, e.g., glycerin and propylene glycol.  In the example illustrated in FIG. 1, the polar solvent is water 101 (e.g., city water), which is
purified before addition to the water phase vessel by passing the water through the following purifiers, sequentially, in the following order: a carbon filter 105, ion exchange equipment 106, reverse osmosis equipment 107, a 100 micron end-point filter
108, and a 50 micron point-of-use filter 109.
<br/><br/> b. Generation of the Water Phase and Oil Phase:
<br/><br/> As described above, for generation of the water phase, the polar solvent and any other water phase ingredients typically are weighed and/or measured, and added to the water phase vessel and mixed, using a standard mixer or other mixer, such as a
homogenizer or other mixer described herein, and typically heated during mixing, whereby the water phase is generated with mixing and heating, typically to low heat (e.g., 60.degree.  C., 70.degree.  C., 71.degree.  C.), according to the provided
methods.  In the example of the scaled-up manufacturing process set forth in FIG. 1, the water phase vessel is a water phase tank 103, which is a water-jacketed tank.  In the example illustrated in FIG. 1, the water phase ingredient(s) are mixed using a
standard mixer 111, for example, a LIGHTNIN.RTM.  mixer (for example, model no. XJC117, a fixed-mount gear drive high-flow mixer), attached to the tank, for example, mounted on the top of the tank.  In the example illustrated in FIG. 1, the heating
apparatus used to heat the water phase ingredients is the water jacket of the water-jacketed tank; temperature on the water-jacket is controlled via a control panel.
<br/><br/> As described above, for generation of the oil phase, the oil phase ingredients typically are weighed and/or measured, and added to the oil phase vessel and mixed, using a standard mixer or other mixer, such as a homogenizer or other mixer
described herein, and typically are heated during mixing, whereby the oil phase is generated with mixing and heating, typically to low heat (e.g., 60.degree.  C.), according to the provided methods.  In the example of the scaled-up manufacturing process
set forth in FIG. 1, the oil phase vessel is a water-jacketed oil phase tank 102.  In the example illustrated in FIG. 1, the oil phase ingredients are mixed using a standard mixer 111, for example, a LIGHTNIN.RTM.  mixer (e.g., model ND2), attached to
the oil phase tank, for example, mounted on the tank.  In the example illustrated in FIG. 1, the heating apparatus used to heat oil phase ingredients is the water jacket of the water-jacketed oil phase tank; temperature on the water-jacket is controlled
via a control pane.
<br/><br/> c. Combining and Emulsifying the Phases
<br/><br/> As described herein, once the oil and water phases reach the desired temperature (e.g., 60.degree.  C., 70.degree.  C., 71.degree.  C. or other temperature), after oil phase and/or water phase ingredients have dissolved, and optionally after
cooling one of the phases, e.g., cooling the water phase to 60.degree.  C. according to the provided methods, the oil and water phases are combined, via transfer, and emulsified, typically via homogenization.  In one example, the transfer is carried out
slowly to prevent clumping in the forming emulsion, such as by stopping the transfer periodically while continuing to mix the emulsion, or by combining the phases slowly with mixing.  In the example of the scaled-up manufacturing processes illustrated in
FIG. 1, the combining of phases is effected by transferring the oil phase to the water phase vessel, via transfer means 112, which include a transfer pump (e.g., a Teel pump, model 2P377B, sold by Granger, Inc.), sanitary fittings, transfer hose(s)
(e.g., food grade hoses sold by Sani-Tech West) and ball valve(s).  Alternatively, the water phase can be transferred to the oil phase.  In the example set forth in FIG. 1, to begin the combining/emulsifying steps, a homogenizer 110 (e.g., an Arde
Barinco, Inc.  reversible homogenizer), mounted on the water phase tank, is turned on, for example, at 850-1200 rpm.  The ball valves then are opened and the transfer pump turned on, thereby effecting transfer of the oil phase liquid to the water phase
tank via the transfer hose(s).  As the phases are combined, the mixture is homogenized by continued mixing with the homogenizer 110.
<br/><br/> In some examples of the scaled-up manufacturing process, to prevent clumping, the pump is periodically stopped (e.g., by turning off the pump), while continuing to mix with the mixer, during emulsification.  In one aspect of this example, this
method to prevent clumping is used when the polar solvent is a solvent other than water, such as propylene glycol or glycerin.  During mixing, the homogenizer can be adjusted, for example, by adjusting the baffle plate on the homogenizer to achieve and
maintain an emulsion, for example, by moving the baffle plate further into the forming emulsion and/or further out of the forming emulsion.  In one example, the shear speed is adjusted to a speed where the oil phase can be seen coming out the top of the
mixer.  In one example, this adjustment is used when the polar solvent is a solvent other than water, such as propylene glycol or glycerin.
<br/><br/> d. Cooling
<br/><br/> As described herein, the forming emulsion typically is cooled, typically rapidly cooled, during the emulsion step.  In the scaled-up process, as shown in the example illustrated in FIG. 1, the rapid cooling typically is effected by repeatedly
passing the forming emulsion through recirculating cooler 115 (e.g., Model No. OC-1000 RO, sold by Turmoil, West Swanzey, N.H.), which is attached to the water phase tank.  Homogenization continues during the cooling step, for example, at between 850 and
1200 rpm.  The cooling continues, for example, until the temperature of the emulsion reaches between at or about 25.degree.  C. and at or about 43.degree.  C., such as between at or about 25.degree.  C. and at or about 35.degree.  C., between at or about
35.degree.  C. and at or about 43.degree.  C., or at or about 40.degree.  C. Typically, the rapid cooling is carried out for between at or about 30 and at or about 60 minutes.
<br/><br/> e. Additional Steps
<br/><br/> As described herein, additional steps can be performed after the emulsion is formed.  In the example of the scaled-up manufacturing process set forth in FIG. 1, the additional steps include transferring the emulsion, via transfer means 112,
which include a transfer pump (e.g., a Teel pump, model 2P377B, sold by Granger, Inc.), sanitary fittings, transfer hose(s) (e.g., food grade hoses sold by Sani-Tech West) and ball valve(s), to a holding/packaging tank 104.  Transfer is performed by
turning on the transfer pump and opening the ball valves.  Additional ingredients can be added, for example, pH adjusters, for example, while monitoring pH, sufficient to bring the nanoemulsion to an appropriate pH, for example, between about 2.6 and
3.2.  Flavors can also be added.  The additional ingredients are mixed into the concentrate using a standard mixer 111.  The addition and mixing of additional ingredients, and/or evaluation can be performed in the holding/packaging tank 104;
alternatively it can be performed prior to transfer to the holding/packaging tank, for example, in the water phase tank 103.
<br/><br/> Variations of this exemplary scaled-up process (FIG. 1) also can be performed using the provided methods, including any of the variations described herein, to make the concentrates.  For example, by elimination and/or modification of one or more
steps and/or equipment, according to the general methods provided herein.
<br/><br/> D. Methods for Preparing Liquid Dilution Compositions Containing the Diluted Concentrates
<br/><br/> Also provided herein are methods for diluting the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates to make liquid dilution compositions, typically, aqueous liquid dilution compositions, containing the non-polar compounds.  Generally, the nanoemulsion
concentrate is diluted into an aqueous medium, for example, a beverage, for example, soda, water milk, juice, fitness drinks, nutritional beverage, nutritional supplement, or other aqueous food or beverage.  The concentrate and the aqueous medium can be
mixed, for example, by stirring and/or blending or by any known mixing means.  The concentrate disperses into the aqueous medium to form an aqueous liquid dilution composition, for example, a clear or partially clear aqueous liquid dilution composition. 
The aqueous liquid dilution composition can be evaluated, for example, to assess the clarity, taste, smell, and/or stability of the liquid.
<br/><br/> In one example, the liquid nanoemulsion concentrate is diluted in the aqueous medium, for example, water by heating the aqueous medium, for example, by heating the aqueous medium, for example, to at least 40.degree.  C. or at least about
40.degree.  C., for example, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 or more .degree.  C., for example, 48.9.degree.  C. In this example, the liquid nanoemulsion concentrate is added, at an appropriate dilution, as described herein, to the heated aqueous
medium, and stirred until dispersed or dissolved in the solution.  The resulting liquid dilution composition can then be cooled, for example, to room temperature, for example, 25.degree.  C. or about 25.degree.  C. Following dilution, the aqueous liquid
dilution composition can be packaged, for example, by transferring to containers, for example, vials or beverage containers.  In one example, a portion of the liquid dilution composition is transferred to vials for analysis, for example, evaluation of
properties, such as clarity, turbidity, taste, smell, ringing, crystal formation and/or other properties.
<br/><br/> Exemplary of equipment used for diluting the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates to form the liquid dilution compositions containing the diluted concentrates are beakers, for example, Pyrex.RTM.  glass beakers, hot plates, for example, the
Thermolyne hot plate, model number 846925 or model number SP46615, stir rods, temperature meters, for example, temperature probes, for example, Cooper Temperature Probes (model no. DPP400W) and scales, for example, the OHUAS 2.0 Kg scale (Model # CS2000)
and/or the Sartorius Analytical Scale (model BA 110S).
<br/><br/> 1.  Dilutions
<br/><br/> Typically, the provided concentrates can be diluted into aqueous media to form aqueous liquid dilution compositions over a wide range of dilutions.  In one example, the concentrate can be diluted so that the aqueous liquid dilution composition
contains between 0.05 g or about 0.05 g and 10 g or about 10 g, typically between 0.05 g and 5 g, of the liquid concentrate per 8 fluid ounces of the liquid, at least 8 fluid ounces of the liquid or less than 8 fluid ounces of the liquid, or per single
serving of the liquid.  For example, the concentrate can be diluted so that the aqueous liquid dilution composition contains 0.05 g, 0.06 g, 0.07 g, 0.08 g, 0.09 g, 0.1 g, 0.2 g, 0.3 g, 0.4 g, 0.5 g, 0.6 g, 0.7 g, 0.8 g, 0.9 g, 1 g, 2 g, 3 g, 4 g, 5 g, 6
g, 7 g, 8 g, 9 g, or g of the concentrate per 8 fluid ounces, about 8 fluid ounces, or at least 8 fluid ounces or at least about 8 fluid ounces of the aqueous medium, for example 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50,
100, 200 or more fluid ounces, of aqueous medium.
<br/><br/> In another example, the concentrate is diluted so that the aqueous liquid dilution composition contains between 1 mL or about 1 mL and 10 mL or about 10 mL of the liquid concentrate, for example, 1 mL, 2 mL, 3 mL, 4 mL, 5 mL, 6 mL, 7 mL, 8 mL, 9
mL or 10 mL of the concentrate, per 8 fluid ounces, about 8 fluid ounces, at least 8 fluid ounces or at least about 8 fluid ounces, or less than 8 fluid ounces or less than about 8 fluid ounces, or per serving size, of the aqueous medium, for example 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100, 200 or more fluid ounces, of aqueous medium.
<br/><br/> In another example, the liquid concentrate is diluted so that the aqueous liquid dilution composition contains at least 10 mg or about 10 mg, typically at least 25 mg or about 25 mg, typically at least 35 mg, of the non-polar compound, for
example, the non-polar active ingredient, per 8 fluid ounces (0.236588 liters) or about 8 fluid ounces, at least 8 fluid ounces or at least about 8 fluid ounces (0.236588 liters) of the aqueous medium, or less than 8 ounces or less than about 8 ounces,
or per serving size, of the aqueous medium; for example, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180,
190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, 475, 500, 550, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1500, 2000 mg, or more, of the non-polar compound per at least 8 fluid ounces (0.236588 liters) or at least about 8 fluid
ounces of aqueous medium.
<br/><br/> 2.  Analyzing the Aqueous Liquid Dilution Compositions Containing the Liquid Concentrates
<br/><br/> Properties of the aqueous liquid dilution compositions containing the liquid concentrates can be evaluated using a number of different evaluation means.  For example, the clarity; desirability for human consumption, for example, pleasant taste,
and/or smell, for example, lack of "fishy" taste/smell, lack of "ringing" and lack of crystal formation; stability, for example, lack of oxidation, "ringing," precipitation and/or visible phase separation, over time; and safety for human consumption, can
be evaluated.  Several of these properties can be evaluated empirically, for example, by observing the liquids immediately or over time, or by smelling and/or tasting the liquids.  In one example, after evaluation of the aqueous liquid dilution
compositions, the concentrates are re-formulated to adjust one or more parameters.  In another example, the dilution factor can be adjusted.
<br/><br/> a. Clarity/Turbidity
<br/><br/> Clarity of the aqueous liquid dilution compositions can be evaluated using one or more of several approaches, for example, empirical observation, measurement of particle size and/or measurement of a turbidity value.  The measurement can be
qualitative or quantitative.  In one example, a particular quantitative or qualitative clarity value is specified.  In another example, the clarity of a liquid can be expressed in relation to the clarity of another liquid, for example, an aqueous liquid
dilution composition made according to the provided methods, or a beverage, for example, a beverage that does not contain the liquid concentrate.  In this example, the liquid can be as clear as, less clear, or more clear than the other liquid.  For
example, an aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the liquid concentrate diluted in a beverage can be as clear or about as clear as the same beverage that does not contain the concentrate.  Either type of evaluation can be done qualitatively,
for example, by empirical evaluation, or quantitatively, for example, by taking a measurement of particle size or turbidity.
<br/><br/> i. Empirical Evaluation
<br/><br/> In one example, the clarity/turbidity of the aqueous liquid dilution composition is evaluated qualitatively, for example, by observation.  In one example, a liquid is considered clear if it does not have a cloudy appearance and/or if it contains
no particles or few particles that are observable with the naked eye.  In another example, the liquid can be considered relatively clear or relatively turbid based on comparison to other liquids, for example, water, fruit juice, soda, and/or milk and/or
other aqueous liquid dilution composition(s) made according to the provided methods.  For example, the aqueous liquid dilution composition can be as clear or about as clear as water or another liquid, for example, a beverage.  For example, the liquid
containing the liquid concentrate diluted in a beverage can be as clear or about as clear as the beverage that does not contain the liquid concentrate.  In a related example, the liquid can be clear or partially clear when there is no substantial
difference, for example, no observable difference, between the aqueous liquid dilution composition containing the concentrate and the aqueous medium that does not contain the concentrate.  A clear liquid is not necessarily colorless.  For example, a
yellow liquid that contains no (or few) visible particles or cloudiness can be clear.  In another example, the lack of crystal formation or of "ringing" can be indicative of a clear liquid.
<br/><br/> ii.  Particle Size
<br/><br/> In another example, clarity/turbidity are assessed by quantitatively measuring particle size and/or number of particles, in the aqueous liquid dilution composition.  In this example, the clarity can be expressed as a numerical representation of
the particle size, or as a comparison to the particle size of another liquid.
<br/><br/> Methods for measuring particle size of liquids are well known.  Any method for measuring particle size can be used, provided that it is sensitive to the particle size in the expected and/or appropriate ranges of the provided aqueous liquid
dilution compositions.  For example, particle size analysis is available commercially, for example, from Delta Analytical Instruments, Inc., North Huntingdon, Pa.  In one example, the particle size of the aqueous liquid dilution composition is measured,
for example, by Delta Analytical Instruments, Inc., using a light-scattering analyzer, for example, a dynamic light scattering analyzer, for example, the Horiba.RTM.  LB-550, which can measure particle sizes within a range of 0.001 micron to 6 micron and
uses a Fourier-Transform/Iterative Deconvolution technique for reporting data and can measure sample concentrations from ppm to 40% solids; the Horiba.RTM.  LA-920, which is a laser light-scattering instrument having an He--Ne laser and a tungsten lamp
that can determine particle sizes from 0.02 micron to 2000 micron using Mie Theory; and other analyzers available from Delta Analytical Instruments, Inc.
<br/><br/> Alternatively, particle size can be measured by viewing the liquid under a microscope under magnification, for example, a 640.times.  magnification.  Particle size then can be measured by comparison to a measuring standard, for example, a ruler,
which also is viewed under the magnification.  In one example, particles about 25 nm or greater than about 25 nm are visible, while particles less than 25 nm are not visible, for example under a 640.times.  magnification.
<br/><br/> iii.  Turbidity Measurement
<br/><br/> In another example, the clarity/turbidity of the liquid is evaluated and/or expressed using a turbidity measurement, for example, Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU).  In this example, turbidity is measured optically, to obtain a value
indicating the cloudiness or haziness of the liquid, which correlates with the number and size of particles suspended in the liquid.  The more clear a liquid is, the lower its turbidity value.  Turbidity can be measured optically, for example, using a
nephelometer, an instrument with a light and a detector.  The nephelometer measures turbidity by detecting scattered light resulting from exposure of the aqueous liquid dilution composition to an incident light.  The amount of scattered light correlates
with the amount and size of particulate matter in liquid, and thus, the clarity.  For example, a beam of light will pass through a sample having low turbidity with little disturbance, creating very little scattered light, resulting in a low turbidity
(NTU) value reading.  Other methods for measuring turbidity can be used, including commercial services for measuring turbidity, for example, the services available through ACZ Laboratories, Inc., Steamboat Springs, Colo.
<br/><br/> The following examples are included for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.
<br/><br/>E. EXAMPLES
<br/><br/>Example 1
<br/><br/>General Procedure Used to Prepare the Liquid Nanoemulsion Concentrates
<br/><br/> Tables 2A-2D and 3, below, set forth ingredients that were used to make exemplary liquid nanoemulsion concentrates, described in further detail in Example 2, according to the provided methods.  Each of these concentrates contained a non-polar
active ingredient, a polar solvent, and a surfactant.  Each concentrate further contained a natural, GRAS-certified, preservative (benzyl alcohol), and was produced, according to this general method, in a 1000 gram (g) or 500 g batch (batch sizes
indicated in Tables).
<br/><br/> Each of Tables 2A-D and 3 sets forth the milligrams (mg) per 2 mL serving of each ingredient in the exemplary concentrate, the percentage, by weight (of the total concentrate), for each ingredient and the amount in grams (g) of each ingredient
per 1000 g batch.  Also indicated in each table, in the "phase" column, is whether each ingredient was added to the water phase ("water"), the oil phase ("oil") or was added later, to the emulsion formed after combining the oil and water phases in the
emulsification step ("emulsion").
<br/><br/> Each of the liquid nanoemulsion concentrates set forth in Examples 2 and 3 was made using a bench-top process of the provided methods.  To make larger batch sizes, the bench-top process can be scaled up to make any of these exemplary
concentrates in Examples 2 and 3, using a scaled-up manufacturing process of the provided methods as described herein.
<br/><br/> The bench-top process for making the concentrates in Examples 2 and 3 was performed using the following general steps (further details are provided in the individual examples):
<br/><br/> To make the concentrates, the indicated amount of each ingredient was weighed using a Toledo Scale (Model GD13x/USA), Sartorius Basic Analytical Scale (Model BA110S) or an OHAUS Scale (Model CS2000).  Selection of scale(s) depended on the weight
of the particular ingredient(s).
<br/><br/> To generate the water phase, the water phase ingredients (indicated by "water" in each table in the "phase" column), were added, in the indicated amount (g/batch), to a water phase vessel (a Pyrex.RTM.  beaker), and mixed using a reversible
homogenizer (Arde Barinco, Inc.; Model CJ-4E), at 30 RPM.  During mixing, the water phase ingredients were heated until the ingredients reached the desired temperature of 60.degree.  C., using a hot plate as the heating apparatus (a Thermolyne hot Plate
Model # SP46615, Barnstead International, Dubuque, Iowa).  The temperature of the water phase and speed of mixing was maintained before combining and emulsifying the water and oil phases.  A temperature meter (temperature probe (Model # DPP400W,
Cooper-Atkins)) was used to evaluate (measure) the temperature of the water phase.  The water phase ingredients included a polar solvent (water) and additional water phase ingredients, where indicated.
<br/><br/> The oil phase ingredients (indicated by "oil" in each table in the "phase" column) were added to an oil phase vessel (a Pyrex.RTM.  beaker), and mixed using a standard mixer (IKA.RTM.  model No. RE-16 1S, which is an overhead mixer (laboratory
stirrer) compatible with the bench-top process).  The oil phase ingredients included a non-polar active ingredient and other oil ingredients as indicated in the Examples.
<br/><br/> As the oil phase ingredients were mixed, they were heated using a hot plate as a heating apparatus (a Thermolyne hot Plate Model # SP46615, Barnstead International, Dubuque, Iowa), to a desired temperature of 60.degree.  C. and generally mixed
at this temperature until ingredients had dissolved, and maintained at the temperature before mixing with the water phase.  A temperature meter (temperature probe (Model # DPP400W, Cooper-Atkins)) was used to evaluate (measure) the temperature of the oil
phase.
<br/><br/> After both phases had reached the appropriate temperatures (60.degree.  C.) and the oil phase components had dissolved, the phases were combined and emulsified.  Emulsification was effected with a reversible homogenizer (Arde Barinco, Inc.;
Model CJ-4E).  The reversible homogenizer, which was used to mix the water phase ingredients, was maintained at 30 RPM for mixing during the emulsification step.  While mixing with the homogenizer at this speed, the oil phase was transferred to the water
phase vessel by pouring it from the oil phase vessel into the water phase vessel.  Mixing with the homogenizer was continued, with adjustment of the baffle plate on the homogenizer to achieve and maintain an emulsion, for example, by moving the baffle
plate further into the forming emulsion and/or out of the forming emulsion.  During emulsification, the forming emulsion was rapidly cooled by placing the water phase vessel (beaker) in a water bath, until the temperature of the liquid reached a desired
temperature, as indicated in the Examples, between 35.degree.  C. and 43.degree.  C., (typically, for a time period between about 30 and about 60 minutes).
<br/><br/> In some examples, after emulsifying and rapidly cooling, additional ingredients were added, where indicated, in the individual Examples/Tables.  In some examples, pH adjusters (e.g., citric acid) were added after combining and emulsifying the
oil and water phases (indicated by "emulsion" in the phase column) while mixing with the reversible homogenizer (Arde Barinco, Inc.; Model CJ-4E).  The pH of the emulsion was measured using a pH and temperature meter (Hanna Instruments, model HI 8314). 
When needed, the pH was adjusted with the appropriate amount of a pH adjuster (amount indicated in tables), for example, citric acid, until the emulsion reached a pH of between 2.6 and 3.4.
<br/><br/> As a final step, the concentrates were filtered using a 100 micron end-product filter, before further evaluation, dilution, and/or use.
<br/><br/>Example 2
<br/><br/>Liquid Nanoemulsion Concentrates with PUFA-Containing Non-Polar Compounds
<br/><br/> This example sets forth the details of exemplary liquid nanoemulsion concentrates containing non-polar compounds (non-polar active ingredients) containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).  The PUFA-containing non-polar active ingredients in
the exemplified compositions were omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids and conjugated fatty acids, including:
<br/><br/> A flaxseed oil compound, which was Fresh Flax Oil, obtained from Barleans Organic Oils, LLC, Ferndale, Wash., which contained not less than (NLT) 55% C18:3 alpha-linolenic acid, and was added at an amount of 5%, by weight (w/w), of the final
concentrate, whereby the concentrate contained 2.5% ALA;
<br/><br/> A borage oil compound, obtained from Sanmark LLC, Greensboro, N.C.  (Sanmark Limited, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China), which was derived by pressing and isolating oil from the seeds of Borago officinalis L. This borage oil non-polar active
ingredient contained not less than (NLT) 22% C18:3 gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), and was added at an amount of 5%, by weight (w/w), of the final concentrate, whereby the concentrate contained 1.1% GLA;
<br/><br/> A conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) compound, sold under the trade name Tonalin.RTM., by Cognis Corporation, Cincinnati, Ohio, which contained 1.7%, by weight (w/w), C16:0 Palmitic acid: 2.6%, by weight (w/w), C:18 Stearic acid, 13.00% C18:1 C9
Oleic acid, 0.20%, by weight (w/w), C18:2 C9 C12 Linoleic acid and 81.00%, by weight (w/w), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which included 39.70% Conjugated C9, T11 isomer and 39.50% Conjugated T10, C12 isomer.  This CLA-containing non-polar active
ingredient was added at an amount of 5%, by weight (w/w), of the final concentrate; and
<br/><br/> Fish oil, containing about 30% DHA/EPA (sold under the name Omega 30 TG Food Grade (Non-GMO) MEG-3.TM.  Fish Oil by Ocean Nutrition Canada Limited, Nova Scotia, Mass.).  The fish oil non-polar active ingredient was added at an amount of 5%, by
weight of the final concentrate, whereby the concentrate contained 1.5% EPA+DHA.
<br/><br/> Tables 2A-2D set forth ingredients and other details of liquid nanoemulsion concentrates, each containing one of the PUFA-containing non-polar compounds described above, the polar solvent water, and a sucrose fatty acid ester surfactant.  The
specific non-polar active ingredient is indicated in each table.  The sucrose fatty acid ester surfactant was DK ESTER.RTM.  F-160, produced by Dai-Ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd of Japan, and distributed through Montello Inc., Tulsa, Okla.  The water was
city water, which was purified prior to addition to the water phase vessel, by passage through using the following purifiers, sequentially in the following order: a carbon filter, an ion exchange purifier, a reverse osmosis purifier and an end-point
filter (a 100 micron end-point filter).
<br/><br/> Each of the concentrates containing these non-polar active ingredients was made using the general procedure outlined in Example 1 above with the following details: The water phase was made by adding the purified water, then the sucrose fatty
acid ester surfactant, which was dissolved by mixing and heating to 60.degree.  C., which was maintained until combining with the oil phase.  The oil phase was generated by adding the following oil phase ingredients to the oil phase vessel, sequentially,
in the following order: 1) non-polar active ingredient; 2) preservative; and 3) surfactant, and mixing and heating to a temperature of 60.degree.  C., which also was maintained until combining.
<br/><br/> During emulsification of the oil and water phases as described in Example 1, the emulsion was rapidly cooled as described in the general method, to a temperature of 40.degree.  C.
<br/><br/> The pH of the emulsion was measured using a pH and temperature meter (Hanna Instruments, model HI 8314) and adjusted with the amount of citric acid indicated in the table until the emulsion reached a pH of between 2.6 and 3.4.

<br/><br/>Example 3
<br/><br/>Liquid Nanoemulsion Concentrates with Coenzyme Q-Containing Non-Polar Compounds
<br/><br/> This example sets forth the details of an exemplary liquid nanoemulsion concentrate made with a non-polar compound (non-polar active ingredient) containing coenzyme-Q, using the general procedure outlined in Example 1, above.  The non-polar
active ingredient in each of these concentrates was Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), sold under the trade name Kaneka Q10.TM.  (USP Ubidecarenone) by Kaneka Nutrients, L.P., Pasadena, Tex., containing greater than 98% ubidecarenone (ubiquinone), and was added at an
amount of 5.25%, by weight (w/w), of the final concentrate.  In addition to the non-polar compound, surfactant, polar solvent and preservative (as described in Example 1), the concentrate further contained a non-polar solvent (Vitamin E oil, sold by ADM
Natural Health and Nutrition, Decatur, Ill., under the name Novatol.TM.  5-67 Vitamin E (D-alpha-Tocopherol; ADM product code 410217)), containing at least 67.2% Tocopherol and approximately 32.8% soybean oil); and a co-surfactant (a phosphatidylcholine
co-surfactant, sold under the trade name S-100, by Lipoid, LLC, Newark, N.J., derived from soy extract and containing greater than 95% phosphatidylcholine).
<br/><br/> Table 3 below, sets forth ingredients and other details of a liquid nanoemulsion concentrate containing the CoQ10 non-polar active ingredient, the polar solvent water, and a sucrose fatty acid ester (SFAE) surfactant (the SFAE surfactant sold
under the name DK ESTER.RTM.  F-160 produced by Dai-Ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd of Japan, and distributed through Montello Inc., Tulsa, Okla.).  This concentrate further contained an emulsion stabilizer (SALADIZER.RTM.  brand emulsion stabilizer, which
was a blend of xanthan gum, guar gum and sodium alginate) and citric acid (pH adjuster).
<br/><br/> The concentrate was made using the general method described in Example 1 above with the following details: For the water phase, city water first was purified by passage through using the following purifiers, sequentially in the following order:
a carbon filter, an ion exchange purifier, a reverse osmosis purifier and an end-point filter, for example, a 100 micron end-point filter.  The water then was added to the water phase vessel, followed by the emulsion stabilizer (water phase) and the
surfactant.  These water phase ingredients were mixed at 30 RMP using a reversible homogenizer (Arde Barinco, Inc.; Model CJ-4E), while heating to a temperature of 60.degree.  C. This temperature was maintained prior to addition of the oil phase.
<br/><br/> For the oil phase, the following oil phase ingredients were added to the oil phase vessel in the following order: 1) non-polar solvent; 2) preservative; 3) co-surfactant, 4) emulsion stabilizer (oil phase) and mixed with the standard mixer and
heated to a temperature of 60.degree.  C., until the co-surfactant had dissolved.  The CoQ10 non-polar active ingredient then was added and dissolved at 60.degree.  C. The amount of the emulsion stabilizer indicated in the oil phase in Table 3 then was
added and dispersed.  Temperature was maintained at 60.degree.  C. until adding to the water phase for the emulsion.
<br/><br/> During emulsification of the oil and water phase according to Example 1, the mixture was rapidly cooled to a temperature of 40.degree.  C. The pH of the emulsion was measured using a pH and temperature meter (Hanna Instruments, model HI 8314)
and adjusted with the amount of citric acid indicated in the table until the emulsion reached a pH of between 2.6 and 3.4.
