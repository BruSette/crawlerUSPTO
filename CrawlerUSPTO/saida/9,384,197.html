       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> This is directed to processing stored data to automatically generate
     metadata for the stored data. In particular, this is directed to
     identifying metadata associated with stored data, and identifying other
     data that relates to the stored data from one or more sources. A
     processing module can identify other data sharing some of the identified
     metadata, and can extract additional metadata associated with the
     identified other data. The extracted metadata can then be associated with
     the user's stored data. The processing module can extract additional
     metadata from any suitable source, including for example local
     application data, social networks or blogging sources, and other remote
     sources. In some embodiments, an electronic device can retrieve data from
     other users for a particular event based on metadata associated with the
     user's data for the event to form a master collection of data.

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> This is directed to tagging stored data, such as media, with automatically discovered metadata.  Metadata can be automatically discovered based on known or available metadata for the stored data by identifying other data also associated with the
known metadata.
<br/><br/> Electronic devices can generate, capture, store or access different types of data.  For example, an electronic device can be used to generate files containing different types of information (e.g., media files, data files, documents,
spreadsheets, or presentations).  To assist the user in classifying or organizing the data, or to assist the user or others in searching for the data (e.g., if the data is later stored in a remote location), different metadata can be associated with the
data.  The metadata can include, for example, information providing the identity of the user generating or editing the data, the content of the data, the location or time at which the data was generated to edited, user-defined tags, or other attributes
of the data.
<br/><br/> Different metadata can be associated with stored data using any suitable approach.  In some embodiments, some metadata can automatically be associated with data when the data is initially generated.  For example, metadata associated with an
application used to generate the data, the person owning a license to use the application, the date and time at which the application was used, various settings describing the format of the data (e.g., the font and paragraph information of a text
document), or an Internet address of a device used to generate the data can be automatically generated and associated with the data by the device used to generate the data.  In some embodiments, metadata can be associated with stored data at a later
time.  For example, metadata providing a time stamp, the identity of a user editing data, a listing of changes made by a particular user, or other such metadata can be automatically associated with stored data when the data is accessed or edited.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a user can instead or in addition manually modify metadata associated with stored data.  For example, a user can access a menu or display associated with the stored data, and remove, add, or change metadata listed in the
menu.  In some cases, a user can add a new metadata field.  As another example, a user can remove all metadata associated with data prior to sending the data to another user (e.g., scrub a file before sending it via email).  As still another example, a
user can select several data files, and simultaneously change the metadata for the collection of data files (e.g., so that they all have the same or different metadata).
<br/><br/> When an electronic device automatically associates metadata with a media item, however, the electronic device may only be able to provide metadata for a limited number of fields.  In particular, the specific metadata automatically provided for
stored data can be constrained by the capabilities of the electronic device generating the data.  For example, a device that does not include positioning circuitry may not be able to provide location-based metadata.  As another example, an electronic
device that does not include a clock may not be able to provide time stamp metadata.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> This is directed to automatically identifying metadata to apply to stored data.  In particular, this is directed to discovering other data sharing characteristics with the stored data, and applying metadata of the other data to the stored data.
<br/><br/> An electronic device can generate or access data for a user.  To assist the user in classifying and managing the data, the data can be associated with metadata.  While some metadata can be automatically associated with the data when the data is
initially generated (e.g., when an image is captured), some metadata may be typically added manually, which can be a burdensome task.
<br/><br/> To automate the metadata association process, a processing module can review the initial metadata associated with data, and identify other information related to the initial metadata.  For example, a processing module can review data used by
applications of an electronic device, and extract metadata from the application data.  In particular, a processing module can retrieve event information from a calendar, and apply metadata extracted from the event information to data having a time stamp
corresponding to the event time.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the processing module can identify entries in one or more social networks that relate to the data.  For example, the processing module can identify social network streams associated with the user accessing the data, or with
friends of the user accessing the data and extract metadata from the social network streams.  In particular, the processing module can identify people who could be in the data content (e.g., event attendees), the event location, or any other metadata
that can be extracted from the social network streams.  In some embodiments, the processing module can instead or in addition search for data from remote sources as a whole (e.g., search some or all of the Internet), and extract additional metadata from
the search data that shares at least some metadata with the user's data.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the electronic device can instead start from the user's data, and search a social network or a larger remote source (e.g., the internet) for some or all of the data that corresponds to the user's data.  For example, the
electronic device can identify the particular set of metadata associated with the user's data, and search for other data that shares some or all of the metadata with the user's data. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> An electronic device can be operative to generate or receive data.  The data can include, for example, text, numbers, spreadsheets, presentations, images, audio, video, or combinations of these.  For example, the data can include media stored or
accessed by the device.  In particular, media can include images, photographs, video, voice or audio recordings, text (e.g., blogging or micro-blogging streams), location streams, or combinations of these.  For the simplicity of the following discussion,
however, different embodiments of the invention will be described in the context of the management of media and the association of metadata to the media.
<br/><br/> As electronic devices become more adept at capturing media, as purchasing media becomes easier, and as remote sources of media become easily accessible, many users can find that they have access to or manage a large media library.  To enhance
the users' ability to navigate through, locate, and share specific media items, many users use metadata to tag and classify the media items.  It may be difficult and time consuming, however to individually or collectively tag different media items by
hand.  Some metadata can be automatically associated with media items by the device used to generate the media item or by a device used to view the media item.  For example, some metadata can be identified based on the output of sensors associated with
the device used to generate the media item.  Such metadata can include, for example, location, orientation, time, temperature, or vibration/movement metadata.  Other metadata can include, for example, metadata retrieved from the content of the media
item.  Such metadata can include, for example, color, texture, face detection, image recognition output, and voice recognition metadata.
<br/><br/> This metadata, however, is limited or restricted by the sensors available to the device, and the information known to the device about the user's library (e.g., who a particular detected face is, or whose voice is selected).  The provided
metadata can therefore be enhanced by augmenting it with additional metadata from remote sources (e.g., cloud-based sources).  In addition, metadata tags retrieved from remote sources can be prioritized such that only a subset of metadata identified from
a remote source is selected, where the remotely identified metadata most closely matches the specific metadata that a user would provide for media in the user's library.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a schematic view of illustrative data that can be generated, accessed, or edited by an electronic device in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.  Data 100 can include content 102 and metadata 110 associated with the data. 
Data 100 can include any suitable type of data, including for example text, numerical, image, video, audio, or combinations of these.  In one implementation, data 100 can include media played back by a device, or media captured by a device.  Content 102
can include image, video or audio tracks that can be played back separately or simultaneously, or can be edited or modified independently or simultaneously.  Each track can be encoded using any suitable approach, including for example using primary
frames (e.g., I-frames) and secondary frames (e.g., P or B-frames), or a sequence of full frames (e.g., individual audio sequences).
<br/><br/> To provide a complete and functional classification system, data 100 can be associated with different metadata 110 that can be catalogued, indexed, and searched.  Metadata 110 can be associated with content 102 using any suitable approach.  For
example, metadata can be stored as part of data 100 that includes the content (e.g., metadata 110 forms a header in a file).  As another example, metadata 110 can be stored in a separate location from the content.  In particular, metadata 110 can be
stored in a metadata file (e.g., one file for each instance of content), a database (e.g., metadata database within an electronic device or within a particular application), remote location (e.g., a remote server), or any other suitable location.  If the
metadata is stored separately from the content, the metadata can be associated with the content using any suitable approach, including for example one or more references in the metadata and/or content, pointers, links, or other combinations of these.
<br/><br/> Metadata 110 can include any suitable type of metadata.  For example, metadata 110 can include sensor-derived metadata 112.  Such metadata can include, for example, the output of one or more sensors or sensing mechanisms of an electronic device
used to capture or generate the data (e.g., the media).  The sensors can include, for example, motion detection components (e.g., an accelerometer), location sensing components (e.g., GPS or cellular tower-triangulation circuitry), cameras (e.g., or
other image capturing sensors), clock, or combinations of these.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, metadata 110 can instead or in addition include content-based metadata 114.  For example, an electronic device can analyze the content of data, and extract attributes of the content.  Such metadata can include, for example,
color analysis or profile, voice recognition outputs, facial recognition outputs, object recognition outputs, information describing landmarks in the data, stabilization information, or any other information extracted from the content of the data (e.g.,
the media content).  The content-based metadata can be generated at any suitable time and using any suitable device.  For example, some content-based metadata can be generated after post-processing data (e.g., using a device used to access the data) and
later associated with the data.  In some cases, the electronic device generating the data can analyze data as it is captured to extract content-based metadata.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, metadata 110 can instead or in addition include metadata entered or defined by the user.  For example, a user can add metadata in one or more fields associated with data.  As another example, a user can modify an
automatically generated metadata field.  The user can enter any suitable metadata for stored data, including for example tags or notes of interest or use only to the user (e.g., a "print these" tag for pictures, or "process" tag for media that has been
captured but not yet reviewed or sorted).
<br/><br/> When an electronic device accesses data, the electronic device can review the metadata associated with the data.  For example, the electronic device can identify the types of metadata that are associated with data by determining the categories
or fields of metadata for which metadata is available.  In some embodiments, it may be desirable to have metadata in at least a threshold or minimum set of metadata categories.  For example, it may be desirable to include metadata depicting the location
or people shown in an image or video.  As another example, it may be desirable to include metadata used for classifying the data (e.g., location, people, event, or timing metadata).  FIG. 2 is a schematic view of illustrative metadata associated with
data in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.  Metadata structure 200 can include different categories of metadata.  For example, metadata structure 200 can include categories or fields of metadata 210 and corresponding metadata 240 associated
with some or all of the fields.
<br/><br/> Any suitable field can be provided in fields 210.  For example, structure 200 can include event field 212, location field 214, people field 216, and time field 218.  In addition, structure 200 can include motion field 220, color palette field
222, and tag field 226.  Structure 200 can have any suitable number of fields, including for example more fields than shown (e.g., as depicted by dots 224).  Structure 200 can include metadata in column 240 in which metadata can be stored for some or all
of fields 210.  In the example of structure 200, metadata may be available for metadata blocks 242, 244, 248 and 250, but not available for blocks 246, 252 and 256 corresponding to fields 210 to 226, respectively.
<br/><br/> Any suitable information can be stored as metadata 240.  For example, individual metadata can include text (e.g., one or more words), numbers, images or icons, links to other information (e.g., hyperlinks), or any other suitable information.  In
some embodiments, metadata can be formatted in a manner corresponding to the field.  For example, metadata related to location can be provided as coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude), a GPS input, an address, or a landmark.  As another example,
motion metadata can be provided as the raw output of an accelerometer (e.g., a voltage along three different axes), a measure of acceleration (e.g., in N/m.sup.2 or G), or as a threshold value indicating the orientation of the device (e.g., portrait or
landscape).  In some embodiments, metadata can include several distinct instances of information corresponding to a particular field (e.g., a list of people or landmarks in an image).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a subset of fields 210 can be identified as more important or more relevant to the user.  For example, the fields of set 230 (with bold outlines) can be identified as a minimum set of fields for which metadata is to be
provided for a user to have a suitable experience interacting with the data.  The particular fields of set 230 can be defined using any suitable approach.  For example, the fields can be automatically selected by a particular electronic device, or for a
particular type of data.  In one implementation, different sets of metadata (e.g., different fields) can be selected as part of a minimum or essential set for different types of data (e.g., different metadata for media and for text documents).  In some
embodiments, a user can define the particular set of metadata that is most important for stored data.  FIG. 3 is a schematic view of an illustrative interface for defining a set of essential metadata fields in accordance with one embodiment of the
invention.  Display 300 can include listing 310 of metadata fields, and corresponding options 320 for each of the fields.  A user can toggle options 320 to select the specific metadata fields to serve as essential fields for a device or for particular
data.  Listing 310 can include any suitable metadata field, including for example all of the fields, a default set of fields, or a subset of the fields.  In some embodiments, a user can add fields to listing 310, for example by calling a secondary
display or pop-up menu.  In some implementations, a display 300 can be called up for each instance of data, for each type of data (e.g., based on a metadata type field, or based on a file type), or for each device used to capture or access data.  In some
embodiments, display 300 can include title 302 depicting the type of data or device to which the display corresponds.
<br/><br/> Any suitable component, process, or module of the electronic device can manage the association of metadata with data.  FIG. 4 is a schematic view of an illustrative system for managing metadata in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. System 400 can include processing module 402 operative to control the association of metadata with data.  For example, processing module 402 can define links or pointers between metadata and data.  Processing module can be implemented as part of any
suitable electronic device component, including for example as part of processing circuitry, memory, storage, or combinations of these.  In some embodiments, processing module 402 can direct other electronic device components to perform one or more
specific operations for retrieving metadata.
<br/><br/> Processing module 402 can retrieve specific data from storage 410 via communications path 430.  Storage 410 can include any suitable local or remote storage, including for example storage accessed over a network (e.g., web-based storage or
storage provided as part of a social network).  Communications path 430 can include a communications path over any suitable wired or wireless network.  In some embodiments, the communications path can be selected based on communications circuitry
available to the device.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, processing module 402 can receive specific instructions from a user regarding which metadata to associate with particular data.  For example, a user can enter metadata associated with one or more specific fields.  Processing
module 402 can receive user instructions, and provide information to display (e.g., menus showing metadata for particular data) using input/output interface 420.  Input/output interface 420 can include any suitable combination of hardware and software,
including for example one or more displays, audio output interfaces, input interfaces, or combinations of these.  In some embodiments, one or more elements of input/output interface 420 can be remote from the device of processing module 402.  Processing
module 402 can communicate with input/output interface 420 using communications path 432, which can have some or all of the properties of communications path 430.
<br/><br/> While some of this metadata can be automatically generated by the device capturing the data or by a device used to access the data, some devices may not have the capabilities required to generate the metadata.  In particular, some devices may
not have the capabilities required for generating metadata in all of the essential fields corresponding to the data.  It may therefore be desirable for a processing module to automatically add the metadata for at least the minimum or essential set of
metadata fields (e.g., as defined by default or by the user using a display such as display 300, FIG. 3).
<br/><br/> Once the electronic device has identified the essential metadata fields that are empty for particular data, or other metadata fields for which it would be desirable to acquire metadata to associate with data, the processing module can identify
different sources from which to retrieve the metadata.  In some embodiments, the processing module can go through a progression of sources for finding additional metadata.  For example, the processing module can first look at information available from
the user's electronic device or from other electronic devices used by the user.  As another example, the processing module can connect to one or more social networks used by the user to retrieve information from the one or more social networks (e.g.,
from metadata associated with data provided by the user's friends on the social network).  As still another example, the processing module can connect to one or more remote sources and search for other data that may be related to the particular data for
which additional metadata is desired.
<br/><br/> As a first step, a processing module can determine some attributes of data based on the available metadata.  For the simplicity of the following discussion, the data will be captured video, though it will be understood that features of the
description can apply to any other type of data.  The processing module can review the available metadata provided with a video, and compare the available metadata with other information available to the electronic device to extract, from the other
information, additional metadata for the video.
<br/><br/> The processing module can extract additional metadata from any suitable application or application data of the device.  For example, the processing module can determine a location and people who may be in the video from a calendar entry
identified from date and time metadata.  As another example, the processing module can analyze one or more frames of the video to detect faces, and compare the detected faces with known faces of a photo or video management application (e.g., iPhoto
available from Apple Inc.).  As still another example, the processing module can analyze one or more frames to detect a particular landmark, displayed text (e.g., part of a business card, a street sign, or a store sign), or other recognizable content. 
The detected text or landmark can be compared to addresses, business names, or contact information (e.g., telephone numbers) known to the device, for example from an address book or history of addresses entered in a mapping application (e.g., a map
website).  As still yet another example, the processing module can process and analyze audio in the video to extract voice prints that can be compared to a library of known voice prints associated with contacts of a user's address book.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 is a schematic view of an illustrative calendar entry used for extracting metadata in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.  Calendar entry 500 can include event title 502, location 510, and time 520.  When the processing
module determines that a captured video was created during or near time 520, the processing module can conclude that the captured video took place in the context of event 502.  The processing module can then tag the video with the event title (which was
not included as metadata when the video was captured) and the location (which may not have been included as metadata if the capturing device did not include positioning circuitry).  In some embodiments, calendar entry 500 can include guests or invitees
530 indicating those present at the vent.  For example, entry 500 can indicate that Joe, Sam and Mike were scheduled to attend, but that Vinnie and Jenn (not shown in invitee field 530) turned down the invitation to attend the event.  The processing
module can then tag the captured video with the names of Joe, Sam and Mike.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the processing module can instead or in addition extract additional metadata by comparing the metadata of several captured videos.  For example, the processing module can identify two distinct videos captured using different
devices within a maximal interval (e.g., captured within a few hours of each other), where only one of the videos includes location information (e.g., due to the absence of location sensing circuitry in the other electronic device).  The processing
module can then apply the same location metadata to both of the videos.  In some embodiments, the processing module can first determine whether a color profile of the videos is similar, whether a same voice is on both vides, or any other information to
ensure that both videos were captured in the same general area.
<br/><br/> Once the processing module has extracted metadata from the local resources available from one or more of the user's electronic devices (e.g., available from a cellular telephone, a communications device such as an iPad available from Apple Inc.,
and a notebook computer), the processing module can expand the search for metadata to one or more social networks.  In particular, the processing module can identify one more social networks used by the user or by the user's friends, and review the data
made available on the social networks.  For example, the processing module can review feeds or other information provided by one or more of <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> flickr, yelp, 4-square, loopt, gowalla, twitter, linked-in, or other social networking, blogging, or
micro-blogging service.  The processing module can initially review the social networking streams of the user accessing or creating the data, and identify entries provided by the user that are within a time frame corresponding to the data.  If one or
more entries correspond to data, the electronic device can review the content of the entries, or metadata associated with the entries (e.g., location metadata) to extract additional metadata to associated with the data.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the processing module can expand the review of social networking streams to identify streams associated with other people.  In particular, the processing module can review streams associated with other people identified in
the data (e.g., identified from the content of a captured video).  For example, a processing module can retrieve the identity of a particular person from an image or video management application (e.g., a face detection output), retrieve a social
networking handle associated with the identified person from an address book, and review one or more social networking streams associated with the retrieved handle.  The processing module can then extract additional metadata from the content of one or
more entries provided by the particular person.  For example, the processing module can identify the name of another person present with the particular person from a social networking entry indicating who was present, and tag the video with both people's
name.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a schematic view of an illustrative social networking stream used to extract metadata for data in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.  Stream 600 can be associated with a particular person, for example a person identified
in title bar 602 (e.g., Joe).  In this example, stream 600 can be associated with another user who the processing module knows, from a calendar entry, was with the user during a calendar event.  Stream 600 can include entries 610, 612, 614, 616, 618 and
620 corresponding to entries provided by Joe.  Each entry can be tagged with a date and time, such that the processing module can review the stream and identify the particular entries that were provided during the calendar event (e.g., between 11 AM and
4 PM on February 14), as well as events that were provided within a duration before or after the event (e.g., 2 hours before and one and a half hours after).  Using this criteria, the processing module can disregard entries 616, 618 and 620 as being
outside of the time constraints.
<br/><br/> The processing module can review entries 610, 612 and 614 to identify metadata from the entries.  For example, the processing module can identify references to other people (e.g., @Sam, @Ron and @Jenn) as well as adjectives or verbs qualifying
the references.  In particular, the processing module can determine from entry 614 that Sam was at the event (consistent with the calendar entry), and from entry 612 that Ron attended as well (in contrast with the calendar entry).  The processing module
can also determine from entry 610 that Jenn did not attend the event (also consistent with the calendar entry).  In some embodiments, one or more entries can include an image, video, audio, link to other content, or any other link for augmenting the
entry.  The additional content can be accessed by selecting a corresponding link, for example option 613.  If the option is provided as part of a potentially relevant entry, the processing module can retrieve metadata associated with the content of the
link (e.g., retrieve metadata associated with a photo of Ron at the event identified by option 613) and associate the metadata with the data.
<br/><br/> To retrieve additional metadata, the processing module can crawl through several layers of social networking streams.  Returning to the example of FIG. 6, the processing module can initially review the user's streams, then move to the streams of
the user's friends within the social network that were identified in metadata for the data, such as Joe's stream.  Subsequently, the processing module can review the streams of friends of Joe that were identified in relevant entries of Joe's stream
(e.g., Ron and Sam's streams).  The processing module can crawl through any suitable number of layers of social networking streams, including for example a fixed number, up to a maximum number, until particular metadata has been found for specific
metadata fields, or combinations of these.  In some embodiments, the processing module can limit the streams reviewed to those of people known or believed to be at the event (e.g., people identified from the calendar event, people mentioned in social
networking streams, or people whose faces were detected in one or more videos or images, including images incorporated in social networking streams).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the processing module can instead or in addition search for metadata from one or more remote sources.  For example, the processing module can connect to a search engine and search for data related to particular metadata
associated with a video.  The processing module can use any metadata as a search term.  In one implementation, the processing module can select some or all of the available metadata.  For example, the processing module can use metadata that is known or
expected to be accurate (e.g., metadata provided by the electronic device that captured the video).  As another example, the processing module can use some metadata identified from the user's electronic devices (e.g., locally-identified metadata) or
metadata identified from social networks used by the user.  In some embodiments, the metadata retrieved from each source can have different priorities or weights.
<br/><br/> For example, the processing module can analyze the content of a captured video and detect a specific color profile.  In particular, the processing module can identify large amounts of orange corresponding to banners displayed in the known
location (Golden Gate Park), or the processing module can identify a combination of purple and blue in the video corresponding to clothing worn by people at the event.  The processing module can search one or more remote sources for other images from the
same general location having similar color profiles, and retrieve metadata from those images.  As another example, the processing module can provide a date and location to a search engine, and determine from the results that a particular event took place
at that time and location (e.g., Valentine's day cook-off).  The event information can be used as metadata for the captured video.
<br/><br/> Once the processing module has retrieved metadata from some or all of the different sources (e.g., local, social network, and global sources), the processing module may need to manage the retrieved metadata to associate only the most relevant or
most correct metadata with the captured video.  In some embodiments, the processing module can provide only a single metadata value for each field (e.g., if the processing module identified adequate metadata for the essential metadata fields at the local
level).  In other embodiments, however, the processing module can determine that several different metadata is available for a single metadata field.  In particular, some of the different metadata can be exclusive such that at least one instance of the
different metadata is incorrect.
<br/><br/> The processing module can determine which of several different metadata to associate with the captured video using any suitable approach.  In some embodiments, the processing module can automatically select specific metadata for each metadata
field.  The processing module can use any suitable criteria for selecting particular metadata, including for example the number of times the particular metadata was extracted, the source (e.g., locally identified metadata has a higher priority that
globally identified metadata), the delay between the time of capture and the time the metadata was identified (e.g., when the processing module extracted the metadata, or when the underlying data from which the metadata was extracted was published),
previous sources from which metadata was extracted, the closeness of a source in a social network, or combinations of these.  In some embodiments, the processing module can average several different metadata, or use any other operation to define a
composite metadata from several different metadata.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the processing module can provide some or all of the extracted metadata to the user for selection.  For example, the processing module can provide extracted metadata for the essential metadata fields.  As another example,
the processing module can provide extracted metadata for fields where there are at least two or three different metadata.  FIG. 7 is a schematic view of an illustrative display for selecting metadata to apply to a field in accordance with one embodiment
of the invention.  Display 700 can include listing 710 of metadata fields for which several different metadata are available.  For example, listing 710 can include location field 712 and people field 714.  Each field can be associated with several
different metadata 722 and 724 respectively, from which a user can select one or more metadata (e.g., select several people that are present in the captured video).  Once the user has selected one or more of the extracted metadata, the processing module
can associate the selected metadata with the captured video.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the metadata provided to the user in display 700 can include initially processed metadata (e.g., metadata pre-selected by the processing module).  For example, the processing module can only present to the user the metadata
having been identified in at least a threshold number of different sources, or in at least a source having threshold level of reliability.  Display 700 can include an option for displaying more or the entirety of the extracted metadata if a user wishes
to view all of the metadata.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the processing module can repeat a particular search for metadata associated with a captured video at several different times.  For example, the processing module can search for metadata each time the video is accessed or
played back, at regular intervals, at varying intervals (e.g., intervals that increase), until particular metadata is identified (e.g., metadata for a particular field), until a user directs the processing module to stop, or until the processing module
cannot find new metadata for the video.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 is a flowchart of an illustrative process for automatically identifying metadata to associate with stored data in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.  Process 800 can begin at step 802.  At step 804, a processing module can
retrieve stored data.  For example, a processing module can capture data.  As another example, a processing module can retrieve data from storage (e.g., remote storage).  At step 806, the processing module can review metadata associated with the stored
data.  For example, the processing module can retrieve metadata associated with the stored data, and determine whether metadata is stored in all of the metadata fields.  At step 808, the processing module can determine whether there are empty metadata
fields.  For example, the processing module can determine whether one or more metadata fields do not have any metadata.  In some embodiments, the processing module can instead determine whether essential, important or more relevant metadata fields
include metadata.  For example, the processing module can determine whether metadata is available for metadata fields associated with location, people and time.  If the processing module determines that none of the metadata fields are empty, process 800
can move to step 810 and end.
<br/><br/> If, at step 808, the processing module instead determines that there are empty metadata fields, process 800 can move to step 812.  At step 812, the processing module can identify empty metadata fields.  For example, the processing module can
determine the specific metadata fields for which metadata is required.  At step 814, the processing module can extract metadata from local resources.  For example, the processing module can review applications and application data for applications
available on a user's electronic device, and retrieve application data corresponding to available metadata associated with the stored data.  For example, the processing module can identify a calendar event corresponding to a date and time at which an
image was captured.  The processing module can extract metadata from the application data corresponding to the stored data.  In some embodiments, process 800 can move directly from step 814 to step 822.
<br/><br/> At step 816, the processing module can identify social network streams of interest for the stored data.  For example, the processing module can identify social network streams associated with the user that generated or is accessing the stored
content.  As another example, the processing module can identify social network streams associated with one or more people known or found to have been present when the stored data was generated (e.g., when a video was captured).  At step 818, the
processing module can extract metadata from the identified social network streams.  For example, the processing module can review specific entries in the social network streams that correspond to the stored data, and extract metadata for the stored data
from the specific entries.  In some embodiments, process 800 can move directly from step 818 to step 822.
<br/><br/> At step 820, the processing module can extract metadata from remote resources.  For example, the processing module can use extracted or known metadata as search terms for additional resources available from a remote source (e.g., the Internet). 
The processing module can extract specific metadata from the additional resources.  At step 822, the processing module can select from the extracted metadata to associate with the stored data.  For example, the processing module can apply a weighing or
averaging algorithm to select particular metadata.  As another example, the processing module can prompt the user to select particular metadata.  Process 800 can then end at step 810.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a flowchart of an illustrative process for associating additional metadata with data in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.  Process 900 can begin at step 902.  At step 904, a processing module can identify metadata
associated with stored data.  For example, the processing module can identify the particular metadata fields having metadata.  In some embodiments, the processing module can determine that some metadata fields, including more important or more relevant
metadata fields, do not include any metadata.  At step 906, the processing module can identify application data of an electronic device that corresponds to identified metadata.  For example, the processing module can review calendar, contact, and media
information corresponding to the identified metadata.
<br/><br/> At step 908, the processing module can identify one or more social network streams corresponding to the identified metadata.  For example, the processing module can identify a social network stream provided by the user who captured or created
the data.  As another example, the processing module can identify a stream associated with a user that appears in the data (e.g., a user captured in an image).  At step 910, the processing module can extract metadata from the identified application data
and social network stream, and associate the extracted metadata with the data.  For example, the processing module can extract metadata from a calendar entry.  As another example, the processing module can review entries from the social network stream
and extract metadata from the relevant entries.  Process 900 can then end at step 912.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, an electronic device can instead or in addition be used to gather some or all data not created or owned by a user based on metadata associated with data created or owned by the user.  In particular, the electronic device can
connect to a remote source (e.g., directly or via a host device) to retrieve other data corresponding to the user's data.  For example, a user can direct an electronic device to retrieve images and video that are similar to one or more images or video
accessed or created by the user.
<br/><br/> The electronic device can determine which data to gather from other sources using any suitable criteria.  In some embodiments, the electronic device can identify other data based on metadata of similar data of interest owned by the user.  FIG.
10 is a schematic view of an illustrative display for identifying other data corresponding to selected data in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.  Display 1000 can include listing 1012 of local data owned or created by the user to serve as
a search term.  The user can select one or more instances of data 1022, including for example individual data items, collections of data (e.g., an event that includes several images and video clips), or combinations of these.  In some embodiments, data
1022 can instead or in addition include specific metadata associated with data of interest.  This approach can allow a user to select a subset of the metadata associate with particular data.  In some embodiments, the electronic device can weigh or
prioritize different metadata associated with the selected data (e.g., use a higher priority for metadata that is shared between the data 1022).
<br/><br/> Display 1000 can include listing 1014 of sources of data to search.  For example, display 1000 can include one or more sources 1024, including for example specific sources (e.g., a specific social network, or a specific social network stream
corresponding to a particular person), or more general sources (e.g., the Internet as a whole).  The user can select one or more sources using any suitable approach, including for example by selecting sources from a list, or by entering information
identifying a specific source.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, display 1000 can include one or more options for specifying the type of data to retrieve from the remote sources.  For example, display 1000 can include an option defining a data type (e.g., media or images).  In some
embodiments, the display can include one or more options for limiting the scope of the retrieved data.  For example, the display can include an option requiring retrieved data to have been generated or captured within a particular time period (e.g.,
during an event).  As another example, the display can include an option for requiring that the data include specific content (e.g., retrieve all images that show the user and another person).
<br/><br/> Once the user has defined the search parameters, the electronic device can connect to a remote source and identify data that corresponds to the search terms.  For example, the electronic device can retrieve, from the Internet, all images and
video that were captured in Golden Gate Park during the birthday event shown in FIG. 5.  By retrieving images and video captured by other people unknown to the user (e.g., not in the user's social networks), the user can review additional images that may
show some or all of the user's event.  This can allow the user to define and share a master or global catalogue of data for an event
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 is a flowchart of an illustrative process for compiling data from disparate sources to provide a comprehensive collection of data corresponding to an event in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.  Process 1100 can begin at
step 1102.  At step 1104, the electronic device can receive a selection of a user's data.  For example, the electronic device can receive a selection of one or more instances of data.  As another example, the electronic device can receive a selection of
particular metadata.  At step 1106, the electronic device can retrieve metadata associated with the selected data.  For example, a processing module can provide a listing of metadata associated with the selected data.  The electronic device can process
the retrieved metadata to identify the most relevant metadata, or the most common metadata for the identified data.  In some embodiments, step 1106 can be skipped if metadata is provided directly at step 1104.
<br/><br/> At step 1108, the electronic device can identify other data associated with the retrieved metadata.  For example, the electronic device can perform a search on one or more remote sources for data that is also associated with the retrieved
metadata.  The remote sources can include, for example, a social network, a blogging or micro-blogging network, the Internet, or combinations of these.  In some embodiments, the electronic device can identify specific types of data to retrieve (e.g.,
only retrieve images or video).  For example, the electronic device can retrieve data that is of the same type as the user selected data.  At step 1110, the identified other data can be provided to the user.  For example, the electronic device can
provide a display having a listing of identified data originating from other users.  Process 1100 can end at step 1112.
<br/><br/> The electronic device used to perform some or all of the features described above can include any suitable combination of hardware, firmware and software for performing offline transactions.  FIG. 12 is a schematic view of an illustrative
electronic device for playing back media in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.  Electronic device 1200 can include any suitable type of electronic device operative to play back media items.  For example, electronic device 1200 can include a
media player such as an iPod.RTM.  available by Apple Inc., of Cupertino, Calif., a cellular telephone, a personal e-mail or messaging device (e.g., a Blackberry.RTM.  or a Sidekick.RTM.), an iPhone.RTM.  available from Apple Inc., pocket-sized personal
computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a music recorder, a video recorder, a camera, radios, medical equipment, and any other device capable of playing back media items.
<br/><br/> Electronic device 1200 may include processor 1202, storage 1204, memory 1206, input/output interface 1208, and communications circuitry 1210.  In some embodiments, one or more of electronic device components 1200 may be combined or omitted
(e.g., combine storage 1204 and memory 1206).  In some embodiments, electronic device 1200 may include other components not combined or included in those shown in FIG. 12 (e.g., location circuitry, sensing circuitry detecting the device environment, a
power supply, or a bus), or several instances of the components shown in FIG. 12.  For the sake of simplicity, only one of each of the components is shown in FIG. 12.
<br/><br/> Processor 1202 may include any processing circuitry or control circuitry operative to control the operations and performance of electronic device 1200.  For example, processor 1202 may be used to run operating system applications, firmware
applications, media playback applications, media editing applications, or any other application.  In some embodiments, a processor may drive a display and process inputs received from a user interface.
<br/><br/> Storage 1204 may include, for example, one or more storage mediums including a hard-drive, solid state drive, flash memory, permanent memory such as ROM, any other suitable type of storage component, or any combination thereof.  Storage 1204 may
store, for example, media data (e.g., music and video files), application data (e.g., for implementing functions on device 1200), firmware, user preference information (e.g., media playback preferences), authentication information (e.g. libraries of data
associated with authorized users), lifestyle information (e.g., food preferences), exercise information (e.g., information obtained by exercise monitoring equipment), transaction information (e.g., information such as credit card information), wireless
connection information (e.g., information that may enable electronic device 1200 to establish a wireless connection), subscription information (e.g., information that keeps track of podcasts or television shows or other media a user subscribes to),
contact information (e.g., telephone numbers and email addresses), calendar information, and any other suitable data or any combination thereof.
<br/><br/> Memory 1206 can include cache memory, semi-permanent memory such as RAM, and/or one or more different types of memory used for temporarily storing data.  In some embodiments, memory 1206 can also be used for storing data used to operate
electronic device applications, or any other type of data that may be stored in storage 1204.  In some embodiments, memory 1206 and storage 1204 may be combined as a single storage medium.
<br/><br/> Input/output interface 1208 may provide inputs to input/output circuitry of the electronic device.  Input/output interface 1208 may include any suitable input interface, such as for example, a button, keypad, dial, a click wheel, or a touch
screen.  In some embodiments, electronic device 1200 may include a capacitive sensing mechanism, or a multi-touch capacitive sensing mechanism.  In some embodiments, input interface can include a microphone or other audio input interface for receiving a
user's voice inputs.  The input interface can include an analog to digital converter for converting received analog signals corresponding to a voice input to a digital signal that can be processed and analyzed to identify specific words or instructions.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, input/output interface 1208 can instead or in addition include one or more interfaces for providing an audio output, visual output, or other type of output (e.g., odor, taste or haptic output).  For example, input/output
interface 1208 can include one or more speakers (e.g., mono or stereo speakers) built into electronic device 1200, or an audio connector (e.g., an audio jack or an appropriate Bluetooth connection) operative to be coupled to an audio output mechanism. 
Input/output interface 1208 may be operative to provide audio data using a wired or wireless connection to a headset, headphones or earbuds.  As another example, input/output interface 1208 can include display circuitry (e.g., a screen or projection
system) for providing a display visible to the user.  The display can include a screen (e.g., an LCD screen) that is incorporated in electronic device 1200, a movable display or a projecting system for providing a display of content on a surface remote
from electronic device 1200 (e.g., a video projector), or any other suitable display.  Input/output interface 1208 can interface with the input/output circuitry (not shown) to provide outputs to a user of the device.
<br/><br/> Communications circuitry 1210 can be operative to create or connect to a communications network.  Communications circuitry 1210 can be capable of providing wireless communications using any suitable short-range or long-range communications
protocol.  For example, communications circuitry 1210 can support Wi-Fi (e.g., a 802.11 protocol), Bluetooth (registered trademark), radio frequency systems (e.g., 1200 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5.6 GHz communication systems), infrared, protocols used by
wireless and cellular phones and personal email devices, or any other protocol supporting wireless communications.  Communications circuitry 1210 may instead or in addition be capable of providing wired communications, for example using any suitable port
on one or both of the devices (e.g., 30-pin, USB, FireWire, Serial, or Ethernet).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, electronic device 1200 may include a bus operative to provide a data transfer path for transferring data to, from, or between control processor 1202, storage 1204, memory 1206, input/output interface 1208, communications
circuitry 1210, and any other component included in the electronic device.
<br/><br/> Although many of the embodiments of the present invention are described herein with respect to personal computing devices, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to personal computing applications, but is generally
applicable to other applications.
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the invention are preferably implemented by software, but can also be implemented in hardware or a combination of hardware and software.  Embodiments of the invention can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer
readable medium.  The computer readable medium is any data storage device that can store data which can thereafter be read by a computer system.  Examples of the computer readable medium include read-only memory, random-access memory, CD-ROMs, DVDs,
magnetic tape, and optical data storage devices.  The computer readable medium can also be distributed over network-coupled computer systems so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.
