       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> Disclosed is a technology for publishing subscriptions in a
     publish-subscribe system in accordance with subscription groups. The
     technology may include (i) determining a consumption characteristic by
     which each of multiple subscribers in a publish-subscribe system consumes
     a subscription published by a publisher; (ii) identifying the subscribers
     whose consumption characteristics satisfy a specified similarity
     criterion; (iii) defining multiple subscription groups, each of which
     includes subscriptions of those of the subscribers whose consumption
     characteristics satisfy the specified similarity criterion; (iv) storing
     the subscriptions in multiple logical partitions of a storage system
     where each of the logical partitions contains a separate non-overlapping
     subset of the subscriptions; and (v) transmitting the subscriptions to
     the subscribers in accordance with the subscription groups.

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>FIELD OF INVENTION
<br/><br/> This invention generally relates to a publish-subscribe system.  More specifically, the invention relates to various techniques in publishing subscriptions to subscribers.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> In computer-related technologies, a publish--subscribe model is typically a messaging model where computer-implemented senders of messages, called publishers, publish messages to be consumed by interested computer-implemented receivers, called
subscribers.  A publisher is an entity that publishes messages.  A subscriber is an entity that subscribes to or consumes the subscriptions published by the publisher.  A producer is an entity that produces information that is published by the publisher. A publisher may publish messages regardless of a number of subscribers, interests of subscribers etc.
<br/><br/> The publishers typically publish messages as a stream of updates and the subscribers consume the messages to which they are subscribed to from the stream of updates.  Typically different subscribers have different consumption rates.  That is,
each of the subscribers in the publish-subscribe system may consume messages at different rates.  For example, a first subscriber may consume X number of messages per second and a second subscriber may consume Y messages per second.  If a publisher is
publishing a total of Z number of messages per second, then the first subscriber may be lagging behind by (Z-X) number of messages and the second subscriber by (Z-Y) number of messages.  The publisher may have to refetch the messages that are not
consumed by the subscribers from a storage system and publish them again.  This may lead to the publisher making excessive calls to the storage system, which consumes a significant amount of time and thus, may introduce further delays in the system.
<br/><br/> Further, in certain publish-subscribe systems, if the subscriber fails temporarily and recovers after a brief period or simply does not receive a message, the publisher may not know a point from which the messages may have to be republished to
the subscriber.
<br/><br/> Additionally, certain publish-subscribe systems may be so tightly coupled that scalability is an issue and routing messages to subscribers at different locations may not be efficient.  In current publish-subscribe systems, publishers that
publish more than a set of subscriptions to the same subscriber may do so by establishing as many connections with the subscriber as the number of sets of subscriptions.  However, establishing too many connections can consume a significant amount of
computing, storage, and network resources.
<br/><br/> In at least some publish-subscribe systems, a producer who generates information to be published as subscriptions and the publishers may be tightly coupled applications.  That is, the producer may be designed to work with a specific
publish-subscribe system.  Such publish-subscribe systems may not be compatible with producers that may not be designed for a specific publish-subscribe system.  This may limit the types of producers whose messages may be published using the
publish-subscribe systems and also the types of messages that may be published.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> What is described below is a method and system for publishing subscriptions in a publish-subscribe system in accordance with subscription groups.  Subscribers in the publish-subscribe system may have varied consumption characteristics (such as
varied consumption rates).  Subscribers having consumption characteristics that satisfy a specified similarity criterion (such as consumption rates falling within predetermined ranges) are grouped together and a subscription group is created for each of
the groups of subscribers.  The subscription group contains subscriptions of those subscribers whose consumption characteristics are similar.  The subscriptions are then transmitted to the subscribers in accordance with the subscription groups.  Further,
as a subscriber's consumption characteristic changes, the corresponding subscription may be moved from one subscription group to another.
<br/><br/> Embodiments of the invention may include (i) determining, by a publish-subscribe system, a consumption characteristic by which each of a plurality of subscribers consumes a subscription published by a publisher; (ii) identifying, by the
publish-subscribe system, the subscribers whose consumption characteristics satisfy a similarity criterion; (iii) defining, by the publish-subscribe system, a plurality of subscription groups, each of which includes subscriptions of those of the
subscribers whose consumption characteristics satisfy a similarity criterion; and (iv) transmitting, by the publish-subscribe system, the subscriptions to the subscribers in accordance with the subscription groups.
<br/><br/> In at least some embodiments of the invention, the consumption characteristic includes a consumption rate of the subscriber, which is the rate at which the subscriber consumes the subscription, and the specified similarity criterion includes
consumption rates of subscribers that fall within predetermined ranges.
<br/><br/> In at least some embodiments of the invention, one of the subscription groups is a lead subscription group which includes subscriptions of those subscribers whose consumption rates fall within a highest predetermined range among the
predetermined ranges.
<br/><br/> In at least some embodiments of the invention, transmitting the subscriptions includes transmitting the subscription groups as a stream, the stream having the subscription groups arranged in a decreasing order of the predetermined ranges of the
consumption rates of the subscribers to which the subscriptions in each of the subscription groups correspond.
<br/><br/> In at least some embodiments of the invention, the consumption characteristic includes characteristics other than, or in addition to, consumption rates.  For example, a subscription group can be created based on certain users' commonly consuming
certain classes of information, such as "highly engaged stories" in a social networking environment.  A "highly engaged story" is defined as a story, article, topic or other set of user-readable information that has some characteristic that shows at
least a specified minimum degree of user engagement, such as the presence of user comments, "likes" (i.e., indications of user approval), or user sharing of the information (or a certain minimum number of occurrences of such features).
<br/><br/> At least some embodiments of the invention may include (i) transmitting, by a publisher in publish-subscribe system, subscriptions to subscribers in accordance with a plurality of subscription groups, each of the subscription groups including
subscriptions of subscribers whose consumption rates fall within a particular predetermined range of a plurality of predetermined ranges, the consumption rates including rates at which the subscriptions are consumed by each of the subscribers; (ii)
determining if a consumption rate of one of the subscribers has changed; (iii) responsive to a determination that the consumption rate of one of the subscribers satisfies a predetermined change criteria, (a) identifying a subscription group among the
subscription groups which includes subscriptions of the subscribers whose consumption rates are similar to the consumption rate of the one of the subscribers, and (b) moving a subscription of the one of the subscribers to the identified subscription
group to create an updated subscription group; and (iv) transmitting, by the publisher, the subscriptions to the subscribers in accordance with the subscription groups, the subscription groups including the updated subscription group.
<br/><br/> Some embodiments of the invention have other aspects, elements, features, and steps in addition to or in place of what is described above.  These potential additions and replacements are described throughout the rest of the specification.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> References in this description to "an embodiment", "one embodiment", or the like, mean that the particular feature, function, or characteristic being described is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention.  Occurrences of such
phrases in this specification do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment, nor are they necessarily mutually exclusive.
<br/><br/> Disclosed is a method and system for publishing subscriptions in a publish-subscribe system in accordance with subscription groups.  The method may include (i) determining, by a publish-subscribe system, a consumption characteristic by which
each of a plurality of subscribers consumes a subscription published by a publisher; (ii) identifying, by the publish-subscribe system, the subscribers whose consumption characteristics satisfy a similarity criterion; (iii) defining, by the

<br/><br/> Environment
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 illustrates a flow diagram 100 for publishing subscriptions in a publish-subscribe (hereinafter P/S) system, according to an embodiment of the invention.  At step 101, a producer generates information.  At step 102, the information
generated by the producer is stored in a storage system such as, for example, a database in the P/S system.  A subscriber can subscribe to all or a set of subscriptions published by the publisher.  The subscriber can subscribe to a particular
subscription by sending a subscription request to the publisher for the particular subscription.  At step 103, the subscriptions are published to the subscribers by the publisher.  At step 104, the subscriptions are consumed by the subscribers.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates an environment 200 in which an embodiment of the invention may operate.  As shown, the environment 200 includes a publish-subscribe system 200.  The P/S system 200 includes a producer 205 that produces information to be
published, a storage system such as, for example, database 206 to store the information to be published, a publisher 204 to publish the information stored in the database 206, and subscribers, namely, a first subscriber 201, a second subscriber 202, and
a third subscriber 203, to consume the information published by the publisher 204.  The P/S system 200 includes a plurality of producers, a plurality of publishers, a plurality of databases and one or more subscribers.  Various entities, including each
producer, publisher, or subscriber, may run on one or more computers in a computer system and may communicate with each other over a computer network.  The publisher 204 and/or the producer 205 can be integrated into the database 206.  Each of the
components in the P/S system 200 can run on one more computers and may communicate with each other over a communication network, for example, Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), and Internet.
<br/><br/> The database 206 may be partitioned into a number of logical partitions, also called "shards." Sharding is a type of partitioning where a configurable number of rows of a database table may be stored in a shard.  For example, in a social
networking environment having Z number of users, a given shard may include data for X out of Z number of users.  In the P/S system 200, the database 200 may include the shards, for example, a first shard 207, a second shard 208, and a third shard 209. 
Each of the shards may include a separate non-overlapping subset of data contained in the database 206.  For example, in a database that has data pertaining to Z users, a first shard 207, a second shard 208, and a third shard 209 may have data pertaining
to A, B, C users respectively, where A.OR right.Z, B.OR right.Z, C.OR right.Z and {A.andgate.B}=o, {B.andgate.C}=o, and {C.andgate.A}=o, and where the symbol .OR right.  denotes a subset of, .andgate.  intersection and o denotes a null set.  Each of the
shards can be held on a different machine or on the same machine.  When a producer 205 generates information, the generated information is stored in one of the shards of the database 206.  The publisher 204 may fetch the information from the shards and
publish them as subscriptions to the subscribers.
<br/><br/> The subscriptions published by the publisher 204 include any new information added to the database 206, modifications of and/or deletions of existing information in the database 206 since some particular time or event.  That is, the publisher
204 publishes any updates to the database 206 and the subscriber may subscribe to subscriptions from the database 206 in which the subscriber is interested.  The subscribers may also request the publisher 204 to publish updates that occurred since a
particular point in time.  The producer 205 may be, for example, any application that causes new information to be added or existing information to be deleted or modified in the database 206.  For example, in a social networking environment, the producer
205 may include a user profile generating application that generates birthday information of a user when the user adds, deletes or changes a date of birth of the user.  A subscriber may include, but is not limited to, an end user, another application, or
service.  For example, an age calculator application may be a subscriber of date of birth information of a user.
<br/><br/> The producer 205 may include a number of applications.  The producer 205 generates new information and stores the new information in their proprietary storage unit, such as a log file in the producer 205 application.  The P/S system 200 may be
designed in such a way that the P/S system 200 is capable of reading information from a portable log file of a number of producer applications.  The P/S system 200 may be capable of extracting new information from the portable log files of the producer
applications and store them as subscriptions in the database 206.  The producer 205 may include an application that may generate information in the application's own database, such as for example, a MySQL database.  The P/S system 200 can extract
information generated by the producer 205 from a log file of the MySQL database in the application.  The extracted information may be stored in the database 206 and later published to the subscribers.  The P/S system may publish the information extracted
from the log file to the subscriber without storing the extracted information in the database 206.
<br/><br/> The publisher may publish subscriptions as a continuous stream of updates.  The subscribers consume their respective subscriptions from the stream.  Each of the subscribers may have a different consumption rate, which is the rate at which they
consume the subscriptions.  The consumption rate may include, but is not limited to, a consumption of number of subscriptions per second, or a consumption of number of bits per second by a subscriber.  For example, the first subscriber 201 may consume
200 updates per second and the second subscriber 202 may consume 60 updates per second.  If the publisher is publishing at 500 updates per second, the first subscriber 201 may only consume 200 of the 500 latest updates and the second subscriber 202 may
consume only 60 of the 500 updates.  Therefore, the first subscriber 201 would be lagging behind by 400 updates and the second subscriber 202 by 440 updates.  Therefore, because of varied consumption rates of each of the set of subscribers, each
subscriber may be consuming the updates at a different position in the update stream.  This may cause back pressure to the publisher 204, since the updates from the stream are not being consumed completely.  In order to avoid such back pressure, the
publisher 204 may have to fetch the updates that were not consumed by the set of subscriber from the database again and republish them to the slower subscribers.  That is, the publisher 204 may have to connect to the database 206 multiple times to
publish the updates to the set of subscribers.  However, making multiple connections to the database 206 increases the load on the database, which may further cause a delay in serving the requests.  Further, this problem may be more severe as the number
of subscribers increases.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, at least to minimize the load on the database 206 and to eliminate the back pressure on the publisher 204, the P/S system 200 may have to reduce the number of connections to the database 206 by fetching the subscriptions less
often.  The P/S system 200 can achieve this by grouping the subscriptions into a plurality of subscription groups and publishing them as a stream of subscription groups.  The subscription groups are formed in accordance with consumption rates of the
subscribers in the P/S system.  The subscriptions are fetched from the database 206 in accordance with the subscription groups.  The publishing of subscriptions as a stream of subscription groups is described in relation to FIGS. 3-5 in the following
paragraphs.
<br/><br/> Methods for Transmitting Subscriptions as a Stream of Subscription Groups
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a block diagram 300 illustrating subscription groups in an update stream transmitted to a subscriber, according to an embodiment of the invention.  The update stream 305 may be a stream of subscriptions transmitted by a publisher such
as the publisher 204 of FIG. 2 to subscribers 306 such as, for example, the first subscriber 201, the second subscriber 202 and the third subscriber 203 of FIG. 2.  The update stream 305 includes subscription groups such as a lead subscription group 301,
a second subscription group 302 and a third subscription group 303.  Each of the three subscription groups includes subscriptions, such as subscriptions 304, of a set of subscribers whose consumption rates fall within a particular predetermined range.
<br/><br/> Consider a P/S system which has a number of subscribers who have consumption rates ranging from 200 updates per second to 800 updates per second.  The P/S system may identify subscribers who have consumption rates falling within predetermined
ranges.  In an embodiment, the number of predetermined ranges may be determined in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, a predetermined number, a random function, based on number of subscribers, based on a difference between consumption rates
of each of the subscribers, or based on number of subscriptions.  For example, in the above scenario, the P/S system may have three different predetermined ranges of the consumption rates, namely, a first predetermined range of 501-800 updates per
second, a second predetermined range of 301-500 updates per second and a third predetermined range of 200-300 updates per second.
<br/><br/> The P/S system can create a plurality of subscription groups, one for each predetermined range.  For example, the P/S system can create a lead subscription group 301 which includes subscriptions of those subscribers whose consumption rates may
fall in the first predetermined range of 501-800 updates per second, a second subscription group 302 which includes subscriptions of those subscribers whose consumption rates fall in the second predetermined range of 301-500 updates per second, a third
subscription group 303 which includes subscriptions of those subscribers whose consumption rates fall in the third predetermined range of 200-300 updates per second.
<br/><br/> The lead subscription group 301 always includes subscriptions of those subscribers whose consumption rates fall in the highest predetermined range among the determined predetermined ranges.  The subscription groups are arranged in a decreasing
order of the predetermined ranges of the consumption rates of the subscribers.  For example, in the update stream 305, the lead subscription group 301 which includes subscriptions of those subscribers with the highest consumption rates is positioned
first, the second subscription group 302 which includes subscriptions of those subscribers with the consumption rates lesser than the consumption rates of the subscribers corresponding to the subscriptions in the lead subscription group 301 is positioned
behind the lead subscription 301 and similarly the third subscription group 303 is placed behind the second subscription group 302.  The subscription groups are published according to their order in the update stream 305.  By publishing the subscriptions
according to the consumption rates of the subscribers, the back pressure on the publisher, created by slower subscribers, may be minimized.
<br/><br/> When the consumption rate of a subscriber changes, a subscription of the subscriber may be moved to a corresponding subscription group.  For example, if a consumption rate of a subscriber whose subscription is in the second subscription group
302 increases such that the consumption rate of the subscriber falls in the predetermined range of the consumption rates of those subscribers having their subscriptions in the lead subscription group 301, a subscription of the subscriber is moved, from
the second subscription group 302, ahead to the lead subscription group 301.  Similarly, if the consumption rate of the subscriber decreases such that the consumption rate of the subscriber falls in the predetermined range of the consumption rates of
those subscribers having their subscriptions in the third subscription group 303, a subscription of the subscriber is moved back, from the second subscription group 302, to the third subscription group 303.  Further, the lead subscription group always
includes the latest subscriptions from the publisher.  If a subscriber is not in a position to consume the latest subscription transmitted by the publisher, the subscription is moved back to a subscription group trailing the lead subscription group.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a flow diagram for transmitting subscriptions from a server to a client in a P/S system in accordance with a plurality of subscription groups, according to an embodiment of the invention.  The method 400 may be used in a P/S system
such as, for example, P/S system 200 of FIG. 2.  In another embodiment, the method 400 may also be used in other similar publish-subscribe systems.  At step 401, the publisher determines a consumption rate of each of a plurality of subscribers in the P/S
system.  The consumption rate of a subscriber may be a rate at which the subscriber consumes the subscriptions published by a publisher.  At step 402, the publisher identifies subscribers whose consumption rates fall within predetermined ranges.  The
predetermined ranges may be based on absolute values or values relative to consumption rates of the subscribers in the P/S system.  For example, if the consumption rates of a slowest subscriber and a fastest subscribers are 200 updates per second and
1000 updates per second, respectively, the predetermined ranges, calculated based on relative consumption rates, may include predetermined ranges between f(200) and f(1000), where f is some specified function.  If the predetermined ranges are calculated
based on absolute values, a lower limit and an upper limit of the predetermined ranges may be a user-configurable value.
<br/><br/> At step 403, the publisher defines a plurality of subscription groups, each of which includes subscriptions of those of the subscribers whose consumption rates fall within a particular predetermined range.  A subscription group which includes
the subscriptions of those of the subscribers whose consumption rates fall in the highest predetermined range, is called as a lead subscription group.  The lead subscription group includes the latest subscriptions published by the publisher and the
remaining of the subscription groups contains subscriptions older than the subscriptions in the lead subscription group.  At step 404, the publisher transmits the subscriptions to the subscribers in accordance with the subscription groups.  The
subscriptions may be transmitted to the subscribers as a stream of subscription groups.
<br/><br/> In other embodiments, subscription groups may be created based on consumption characteristics other than, or in addition to, consumption rates.  For example, a subscription group (or multiple subscription groups) can be created based on certain
users' commonly consuming certain classes of information, such as "highly engaged stories" in a social networking environment.  A "highly engaged story" is defined as a story, article, topic or other set of user-understandable information that has some
characteristic that shows at least a specified minimum degree of user engagement, such as the presence of user comments, "likes" (i.e., indications of user approval), or user sharing of the information (or a certain minimum number of occurrences of such
features).  Such information can include multimedia content such as text, audio, picture, video, animation, or a combination thereof.  Therefore, in some embodiments a subscription group can be created for all users who subscribe to a particular highly
engaged story.  It is envision that other criteria could also be used to define subscription groups.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 5A and 5B collectively are flow diagrams for moving a subscription between subscription groups, according to an embodiment of the invention.  The method 500 may be used in a P/S system such as, for example, P/S system 200 of FIG. 2.  The
method 500 may be used in other similar P/S systems.  At step 501, the publisher transmits the subscriptions to subscribers in accordance with subscription groups, for example, created using the method 400 of FIG. 4.  At decision step 502, the publisher
determines whether a consumption rate of a subscriber has changed.  Responsive to a determination that the consumption rate of a subscriber has not changed, the method 400 returns.  On the other hand, responsive to a determination that the consumption
rate of a subscriber has changed, at step 503, the publisher identifies a subscription group among the subscription groups which includes subscriptions of the subscribers whose consumption rates are similar to or correspond to a predetermined range of
the consumption rate of the subscriber.
<br/><br/> At step 504, the publisher moves the subscription to the identified subscription group.  The identified subscription group is updated with moved subscription.  At step 505, the publisher transmits the subscriptions to the subscribers in
accordance with the subscription groups, the subscription groups including the updated subscription group.
<br/><br/> Referring back to step 504, the subscription may be moved to a subscription group ahead or behind a current subscription group the subscription belongs to, based on whether the consumption rate of the subscriber has increased or decreased.  FIG.
5B illustrates moving the subscription to a subscription group ahead or behind the current subscription group, according to an embodiment of the invention.  At step 551, it is determined, by the P/S system, whether a consumption rate of the subscriber
has increased or decreased.  Responsive to a determination that the consumption rate of the subscriber has increased, at step 552, the subscription is moved, by the P/S system, to the identified subscription group ahead of the current subscription group
the subscription belongs to.  Responsive to a determination that the consumption rate of the subscriber has decreased, at step 553, the subscription is moved, by the P/S system, to the identified subscription group behind the current subscription group
the subscription belongs to.
<br/><br/> Further, a subscription group may be split into one or more new subscription groups based on criteria for splitting.  The criteria for splitting may include, but is not limited to, changed consumption rates of subscribers and number of
subscriptions in the subscription group.  Consumption rates of a few subscribers having subscriptions in a particular subscription group may change.  If there are no existing subscription groups that have subscriptions of subscribers having consumption
rates similar to or in a predetermined range of the consumption rates of the few subscribers, the particular subscription group may be split into a plurality of new subscription groups.  The new subscription groups may have new predetermined ranges of
consumption rates.  For example, referring to FIG. 3, the third subscription group 303 may be split into a plurality of new subscription groups having different predetermined ranges.
<br/><br/> Similarly, a plurality of subscription groups may be merged into one subscription group, based on criteria for splitting.  The criteria for merging the subscription groups may include, but is not limited to, changed consumption rates of
subscribers and number of subscriptions in each of the subscription groups.  Consumption rates of subscribers corresponding to the subscriptions across the subscription groups may change such that, for example, the consumption rates are within a
predetermined range of the consumption rates of subscribers corresponding to subscriptions in another subscription group.  For example, referring to FIG. 3, second subscription group 302 and third subscription group 303 may be merged into a new
subscription group.  In another embodiment, consumption rates of subscribers may change such that, for example, the consumption rates of all subscribers corresponding to the subscriptions across all the subscription groups may be within a new
predetermined range.  In such cases, the subscription groups may be merged into a new subscription group.  The subscribers corresponding to the subscriptions in the new subscription group may have consumption rates that fall in a new predetermined range
or one of existing predetermined ranges.
<br/><br/> Referring back to step 552, a subscription from a subscription group may not be moved ahead of the lead subscription group even if a consumption rate of a subscriber associated with the subscription increases beyond a predetermined range of
consumption rates of subscribers associated with subscriptions in the lead subscription group.  A lead subscription group is always positioned first in a stream of subscription groups transmitted to the subscribers.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating updating a storage system with new information generated by a producer in a publish-subscribe system, according to an embodiment of the invention.  The P/S system 600 may be similar to the P/S system 200 of
FIG. 2.  A producer 603 may generate new information which may be stored in a storage system such as, for example, database 602 and a publisher 601 may publish this new information as subscriptions to subscribers.  Inbound data to the database 602 may
include the new information from the producer 603 and the outbound data may include the subscriptions published to the subscribers.  Typically, a P/S system may have to ensure that subscribers get the latest information with minimum or no delay.  To
ensure that subscribers get the latest information with minimum or no delay, a rate of outbound data may have to be same as a rate of inbound data, in the P/S system 600.  That is, the publisher 601 in the P/S system 600 may have to publish the
subscriptions at least at a rate at which the new information is received from the producer 603.
<br/><br/> A lead subscription group includes latest subscriptions from the database.  The lead subscription group is transmitted at least at a rate at which the inbound data is received at the database 602 from the producer 603.  The lead subscription
group may not be slowed down.  If a subscriber is slow in consuming a subscription in the lead subscription group, the subscription is moved to another subscription group trailing the lead subscription group.
<br/><br/> Dynamically Routing Subscriptions from a Publisher to a Subscriber
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating dynamic routing of subscriptions from a publisher to a subscriber in a P/S system 700, according to an embodiment of the invention.  Consider a scenario where a publisher such as, for example, node A 701 in
first location 704 may have to publish a subscription to a subscriber node H in second location 705.  The publisher, node A may have to make a network connection from node A in the first location 704 to node H in the second location 705 to transmit the
subscription.  Similarly, publisher node D may have to make network connections to subscriber nodes I and J in the second location 705, publisher node E to subscriber node H, and publisher node F to subscriber node G (all network connections indicated by
dashed lines).  A number of network connections are made from the first location 704 to the second location 705.  If the first location 704 and second location 705 are in, for example, different countries, making a number of cross country network
connections may consume significant amount of time, resources, cost etc. Further, delays may be introduced in the P/S system if the network connections are slow.  In order to avoid the above mentioned disadvantages, the P/S system 700 may dynamically
generate a route from a source publisher to a destination subscriber via intermediary nodes such that the efficiency of the system, at least in terms of amount of time consumed, resources used, or cost incurred, may be improved.
<br/><br/> The P/S system 700 may generate a route using any or all of the nodes, namely, nodes A-J as intermediary nodes.  Each of the nodes may act as a producer, a publisher, a consumer, or any combination of these three types of entities.  For example,
node A 701 may act as a producer, a publisher, a consumer combination 702.  Nodes A-F are in the first location 704 and nodes G-J are in the second location 705.  The first location 704 and the second location 705 may include, but is not limited to,
different buildings, different cities, different countries, or different continents.  In an embodiment, nodes A-F may be in a same location.
<br/><br/> Each of the intermediary nodes may act as a producer, a publisher and a subscriber.  The intermediary node consumes the subscription transmitted by a previous node, produces the consumed subscription as a new subscription and publishes the new
subscription to a next node.  That is, each of the intermediary nodes may act as a proxy publisher-subscriber for transmitting the subscriptions from the source publisher to the destination subscriber.  Each of the nodes can run on or more computers in a
computer system.  In P/S system 700, new routes are generated dynamically using which nodes A-F in the first location 704 can publish subscriptions to nodes G-J in the second location 705.  For example, node A can publish the subscriptions to node H
using the route A.fwdarw.B.fwdarw.C.fwdarw.D.fwdarw.H.  Similarly, node D can publish the subscriptions to nodes J and I using the routes D.fwdarw.H.fwdarw.J and D.fwdarw.H.fwdarw.I, respectively, node E can publish the subscriptions to node H using the
route E.fwdarw.D.fwdarw.H, and node F can publish the subscriptions to node G using the route F.fwdarw.D.fwdarw.H.fwdarw.G.
<br/><br/> As can be seen, the number of network connections from the first location 704 to the second location 705 is minimized to a single network connection from node D to node H. All the subscriptions from any of the publishers in the first location
704 to the any of the subscribers in the second location 705 are routed through the single network connection.  Further, chaining the nodes in the above manner may also help in avoiding a situation where a same subscription is sent to the second location
705 over more than one network connection between the nodes in the first location 704 and the second location 705.  For example, consider a scenario where nodes J and I have subscribed to same subscriptions from node D. The above generated route enables
transmitting the subscription to nodes J and I using a single network connection between node D in the first location 704 and node H in the second location 705.  The subscription may then be transmitted to each of the nodes I and H from node H.
<br/><br/> A P/S system 700 may use a message queue such as, for example, message queue 703 to transmit the subscriptions between nodes.  A message queue which uses a queue for messaging (which typically includes passing of control information or of data)
may be used for inter-process communications.  Message queues may be generated along the route from the source publisher to the destination subscriber to transmit the subscriptions.  A message placed onto the queue may be stored until the recipient
(node) retrieves the message.  The subscriber receives the subscriptions in an order transmitted by the publisher.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 800 for dynamically generating a route from a publisher to a subscriber to transmit a subscription from the publisher to the subscriber, according to an embodiment of the invention.  The method 800
may be used in a P/S system such as, for example, P/S system 700 of FIG. 7.  At step 801, a publisher determines an intermediary node through which the publisher can transmit subscriptions to a subscriber.  The intermediary node acts as at least one of a
producer, a publisher or a subscriber.  Further, the intermediary node may perform at least one of (i) consuming the subscription transmitted by a previous node, (ii) producing the subscription consumed as a new subscription, or (iii) publishing the new
subscription to a next node.
<br/><br/> At step 802, the publisher generates a route including the publisher, the subscriber and the determined intermediary node.  At step 803, the publisher transmits the subscriptions to the subscriber using the generated route.
<br/><br/> Checkpoints in Subscriptions
<br/><br/> For every subscription transmitted by a publisher, such as, for example, publisher 204 of FIG. 2, a subscriber such as, for example, first subscriber 201 may receive a token, also referred as a checkpoint.  By responding to such token, the first
subscriber 201 may inform the publisher 204 that the first subscriber 201 has consumed all the subscriptions prior to this token successfully.  The subscriber may acknowledge a token either (i) immediately after consuming a subscription the token is
associated with, (ii) after consuming a configurable number of subscriptions, or (iii) after consuming subscriptions for a configurable period of time.  Acknowledging a token after consuming a configurable number of subscriptions or after consuming
subscriptions for a configurable period of time indicates that the subscriber has consumed a number of subscriptions, or subscriptions for the configurable period of time successfully.  Transmitting a single acknowledgement for a plurality of
subscriptions saves, at least, time and network bandwidth consumed as compared to sending an acknowledgement for every single subscription consumed.  If the publisher 204 does not receive an acknowledgement for a token in accordance with any of the above
mentioned three criteria, the publisher 204 may resend the subscriptions from a point immediately after the last token for which the publisher 204 received the acknowledgment.
<br/><br/> Further, in an embodiment, transmitting the subscriptions to the subscribers and receiving the acknowledgements for the transmitted subscriptions can be performed synchronously or asynchronously.  Transmitting the subscriptions and receiving the
acknowledgements for the transmitted asynchronously, enables the publisher 204 to transmit a subsequent subscription to the subscriber without having to wait for the subscriber to acknowledge a previously transmitted subscription.  Accordingly, a delay
caused due to waiting to receive an acknowledgement for every subscription transmitted, before a subsequent subscription could be transmitted, is minimized.
<br/><br/> The token may indicate at least one of (i) a position of the subscription in a stream of subscriptions transmitted to the first subscriber 201, or (ii) a time when the subscription was published by the publisher 204.  The token may be added to
the subscription by the publisher 204.
<br/><br/> Subscribing to a Logical Partition of a Database in a Publish-Subscribe System
<br/><br/> As described above with respect to FIG. 2, a database 206 in a P/S system 200 may, contain subscriptions which include information generated by a producer 205.  The database 206 may be considered to be made up of a number of logical partitions,
wherein each of the logical partitions contains a subset of the subscriptions in the database.  Further, the logical partitions contain non-overlapping subsets of subscriptions in the database.  For example, database 206 may have data pertaining to Z
users which are stored in different shards.  For example, a first shard 207, a second shard 208, and a third shard 209 may have data pertaining to A, B, C users respectively, where A.OR right.Z, B.OR right.Z, and C.OR right.Z and {A.andgate.B}=o,
{B.andgate.C}=o, and {C.andgate.A}=o, and where the symbol .OR right.  denotes a subset of, .andgate.  intersection and o denotes a null set.  That is, each of the logical partitions may have data that is different from each other.  In order to ensure
that all subscriptions from the database 206 are being subscribed to, the P/S system 200 has to ensure that each of the logical partitions, namely, a first shard 207, a second shard 208, and a third shard 209 has a subscriber who is subscribed to the
subscriptions from the logical partition.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 900 to invite a subscriber to subscribe to a logical partition of a storage system, according to an embodiment of the invention.  At determination step 901, the publisher determines whether each of
the logical partitions of the storage system such as, for example, a database is subscribed to by at least one of the subscribers.  Responsive to a determination that a logical partition among the logical partitions of the database is not subscribed to
by the at least one of the subscribers, at step 902, the publisher identifies a subscriber from the subscribers as a potential consumer of a set of subscriptions contained in the logical partition.  On the other hand, responsive to a determination that
all the logical partitions of the database are subscribed to by at least one subscriber, the method 900 returns.  At step 903, the publisher sends an invitation to the subscriber to subscribe to the set of subscriptions contained in the logical
partition.
<br/><br/> Referring back to step 902, in an embodiment, a subscriber may be identified as a potential consumer of a set of subscriptions based, at least in part, on a random function.
<br/><br/> Multiplexing Multiple Subscriptions
<br/><br/> In a P/S system with many publishers and many subscribers, there may often exist multiple subscriptions between a given publisher and a subscriber.  Such subscriptions between a given publisher and a subscriber are typically transmitted over
multiple network connections, such as transfer control protocol (TCP)/Internet protocol (IP) connections.  The number of network connections between a given publisher and a subscriber may be minimized by multiplexing the subscriptions over a single
network connection.
<br/><br/> FIG. 10 is a block diagram illustrating a multiplexer for multiplexing subscriptions between a publisher-subscriber pair, according to an embodiment of the invention.  A P/S system 1000 includes a first subscriber 1001 and a second subscriber
1002 receiving subscriptions from a publisher 1004.  The P/S system 1000 also includes a storage system such as, for example, database 1005 storing subscriptions in logical partitions, namely, LP1, LP2 and LP3.  The first subscriber 1001 may have
subscribed to two sets of subscriptions, for example, one from the logical partition LP1 and another from the logical partition LP2.  A second subscriber 1002 may have subscribed to one or more of the logical partitions LP1, LP2 or LP3.
<br/><br/> Separate network connections may be created, between a given publisher and a subscriber, for transmitting subscriptions from each logical partition a subscriber is subscribed to.  Accordingly, for the first subscriber 1001, two separate network
connections are created between the first subscriber 1001 and the publisher 1004.  A first network connection 1006 is created for transmitting subscriptions from logical partition LP1 and a second network connection 1007 is created for transmitting
subscriptions from logical partition LP2.  A multiplexer 1003 enables transmitting both sets of the subscriptions to the first subscriber 1001 over a single network connection such as 1008 by multiplexing the subscriptions from both the logical
partitions LP1 and LP2 over the network connection 1008.
<br/><br/> The multiplexer 1003 can be integrated into the publisher 1004, or can run on one or more different machines.  Further, the network connection may include, but is not limited to, TCP/IP.  The P/S system 1000 may be similar to the P/S system 200
of FIG. 2, but may include the multiplexer 1004 additionally.
<br/><br/> FIG. 11 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 1100 for multiplexing multiple subscriptions between a publisher and a subscriber, according to an embodiment of the invention.  The method 1100 may be used in P/S system such as, for example, P/S
system 1000 of FIG. 10.  At step 1101, a multiplexer identifies a plurality of subscriptions published by a publisher of a P/S system to a first subscriber in the P/S system.  Each of the subscriptions may be contained in different logical partitions of
a storage system in the P/S system.  At step 1102, the multiplexer creates a single network connection that is capable of transmitting subscriptions from a single logical partition, between the publisher and the first subscriber.  At step 1103, the
publisher transmits the subscriptions to the first subscriber by multiplexing the subscriptions that are fetched from different logical partitions, over the single network connection between the publisher and the first subscriber.
<br/><br/> Auto-Identification of Deprecated Logical Partitions
<br/><br/> A logical partition of a storage system may become inactive or non-functional or deprecated for various reasons, such as data in the storage system being migrated from one machine to another machine, a part of the data in storage system being
non-accessible, data being moved from one logical partition to another, data being moved from one part of a storage system to another part of the storage system on the same machine, the logical partition being made unavailable to a particular publisher,
or the logical partition being moved off of a particular publisher.  When a logical partition becomes inactive, a P/S system may have to determine whether the logical storage has failed permanently and whether the data has moved from one logical
partition to another logical partition.  If the publisher determines that it no longer needs to consider a logical partition (such as would happen if the partition moved), the publisher takes actions to reclaim resources that may have been allocated for
that partition.  The following paragraphs, in association with FIGS. 12 and 13, describe how a publisher makes that determination.
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 1200 for sending an invitation to subscribers to subscribe to a new logical partition in case of a failure of an existing logical partition, according to an embodiment on the invention.  At
determination step 1201, the publisher determines whether a logical partition of a storage system such as, for example, a database in a P/S system has failed permanently.  Responsive to a determination that the logical partition has not failed, the
method 1200 returns.  On the other hand, responsive to a determination that the logical partition has failed permanently, at step 1202, the publisher notifies the subscribers subscribed to the set of subscriptions in the logical partition that the first
logical partition has failed.  At step 1203, the publisher determines a new logical partition to which the set of subscriptions has moved to from the logical partition.  In an embodiment of the invention, the first logical partition and the second
logical partition may or may not be in a same database.  At step 1204, the publisher sends an invitation to the subscribers to subscribe to the set of subscriptions in the new logical partition.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 1300 to determine if a logical partition has permanently failed, according to an embodiment of the invention.  At determination step 1301, the publisher determines whether no subscriptions have
been published from a logical partition for a predetermined period.  Responsive to a determination that subscriptions have been published from the logical partition in the predetermined period, the method 1300 returns.  On the other hand, responsive to a
determination that no subscriptions have been published from the logical partition for the predetermined period, at step 1302, the publisher executes a process to indicate that a logical partition is inactive.  In an embodiment, the process may include a
garbage collection process that terminates publishing of subscriptions from the logical partition.  At determination step 1303, the publisher determines whether a number of times that the process is executed exceeds a predefined threshold.  Responsive to
a determination that a number of times the process is executed does not exceed a predefined threshold, the method 1300 returns.  On the other hand, responsive to a determination that a number of times the process is executed exceeds a predefined
threshold, at step 1304, the publisher determines that the logical partition has failed permanently.  In another embodiment, a P/S system may determine that the logical partition has failed permanently if the logical unit is inactive for a certain period
of time.  A publisher of the P/S system may include other processes that are capable of distinguishing between when a logical partition is temporarily inactive or permanently inactive.  Further, at least some of the acts described above as being
performed by the publisher, may instead be performed by various other modules or entities in the P/S system in cooperation with the publisher.
<br/><br/> Exemplary Apparatus for Implementation
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 is a block diagram of an apparatus that may perform various operations, and store various information generated and/or used by such operations, according to an embodiment of the invention.  The apparatus may represent any computer
described herein.  The computer 1400 is intended to illustrate a hardware device on which any of the entities, components or services depicted in the examples of FIGS. 1-13 (and any other components described in this specification) can be implemented
such as publishers, subscribers, producers, databases etc. The computer 1400 includes one or more processors 1401 and memory 1402 coupled to an interconnect 1403.  The interconnect 1403 is shown in FIG. 14 as an abstraction that represents any one or
more separate physical buses, point to point connections, or both connected by appropriate bridges, adapters, or controllers.  The interconnect 1403, therefore, may include, for example, a system bus, a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus or
PCI-Express bus, a HyperTransport or industry standard architecture (ISA) bus, a small computer system interface (SCSI) bus, a universal serial bus (USB), IIC (I2C) bus, or an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard 1394 bus,
also called "Firewire".
<br/><br/> The processor(s) 1401 is/are the central processing unit (CPU) of the computer 1400 and, thus, control the overall operation of the computer 1400.  In certain embodiments, the processor(s) 1401 accomplish this by executing software or firmware
stored in memory 1402.  The processor(s) 1401 may be, or may include, one or more programmable general-purpose or special-purpose microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs), programmable controllers, application specific integrated circuits
(ASICs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), trusted platform modules (TPMs), or the like, or a combination of such devices.
<br/><br/> The memory 1402 is or includes the main memory of the computer 1400.  The memory 1402 represents any form of random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, or the like, or a combination of such devices.  In use, the memory
1402 may contain a code.  In one embodiment, the code includes a general programming module configured to recognize the general-purpose program received via the computer bus interface, and prepare the general-purpose program for execution at the
processor.  In another embodiment, the general programming module may be implemented using hardware circuitry such as ASICs, PLDs, or field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
<br/><br/> Also connected to the processor(s) 1401 through the interconnect 1403 are a network adapter 1407, a storage device(s) 1405 and I/O device(s) 1406.  The network adapter 1407 provides the computer 1400 with the ability to communicate with remote
devices, over a network and may be, for example, an Ethernet adapter or Fibre Channel adapter.  The network adapter 1407 may also provide the computer 1400 with the ability to communicate with other computers within the cluster.  In some embodiments, the
computer 1400 may use more than one network adapter to deal with the communications within and outside of the cluster separately.
<br/><br/> The I/O device(s) 1406 can include, by way of example but not limitation, a keyboard, a mouse or other pointing device, disk drives, printers, a scanner, and other input and/or output devices, including a display device.  The display device can
include, by way of example but not limitation, a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), or some other applicable known or convenient display device.
<br/><br/> The code stored in memory 1402 may be implemented as software and/or firmware to program the processor(s) 1401 to carry out actions described above.  In certain embodiments, such software or firmware may be initially provided to the computer
1400 by downloading it from a remote system through the computer 1400 (e.g., via network adapter 1407).
<br/><br/> The techniques introduced herein can be implemented by, for example, programmable circuitry (e.g., one or more microprocessors) programmed with software and/or firmware, or entirely in special-purpose hardwired (non-programmable) circuitry, or
in a combination of such forms.  Special-purpose hardwired circuitry may be in the form of, for example, one or more ASICs, PLDs, FPGAs, etc.
<br/><br/> Software or firmware for use in implementing the techniques introduced here may be stored on a machine-readable storage medium and may be executed by one or more general-purpose or special-purpose programmable microprocessors.  A
"machine-readable storage medium", as the term is used herein, includes any mechanism that can store information in a form accessible by a machine.
<br/><br/> A machine may also be a server computer, a client computer, a personal computer (PC), a tablet PC, a laptop computer, a set-top box (STB), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, an iPhone, a Blackberry, a processor, a
telephone, a web appliance, a network router, switch or bridge, or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions (sequential or otherwise) that specify actions to be taken by that machine.
<br/><br/> A machine-accessible storage medium or a storage device(s) 1405 includes, for example, recordable/non-recordable media (e.g., read-only memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); magnetic disk storage media; optical storage media; flash memory
devices; etc.), etc., or any combination thereof.  The storage medium typically may be non-transitory or include a non-transitory device.  In this context, a non-transitory storage medium may include a device that is tangible, meaning that the device has
a concrete physical form, although the device may change its physical state.  Thus, for example, non-transitory refers to a device remaining tangible despite this change in state.
<br/><br/> The term "logic", as used herein, can include, for example, programmable circuitry programmed with specific software and/or firmware, special-purpose hardwired circuitry, or a combination thereof.
