device.
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 depicts an illustrative embodiment of a first communication system 100 for delivering media content.  The communication system 100 can represent an Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) broadcast media system.  The IPTV media system can
include a super head-end office (SHO) 110 with at least one super headend office server (SHS) 111 which receives media content from satellite and/or terrestrial communication systems.  In the present context, media content can represent audio content,
moving image content such as videos, still image content, or combinations thereof.  The SHS server 111 can forward packets associated with the media content to video head-end servers (VHS) 114 via a network of video head-end offices (VHO) 112 according
to a common multicast communication protocol.
<br/><br/> The VHS 114 can distribute multimedia broadcast programs via an access network 118 to commercial and/or residential buildings 102 housing a gateway 104 (such as a common residential or commercial gateway).  The access network 118 can represent a
group of digital subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAMs) located in a central office or a service area interface that provide broadband services over optical links or copper twisted pairs 119 to buildings 102.  The gateway 104 can use common
communication technology to distribute broadcast signals to media processors 106 such as Set-Top Boxes (STBs) which in turn present broadcast channels to media devices 108 such as computers or television sets managed in some instances by a media
controller 107 (such as an infrared or RF remote control).
<br/><br/> The gateway 104, the media processors 106, and media devices 108 can utilize tethered interface technologies (such as coaxial or phone line wiring) or can operate over a common wireless access protocol.  With these interfaces, unicast
communications can be invoked between the media processors 106 and subsystems of the IPTV media system for services such as video-on-demand (VoD), browsing an electronic programming guide (EPG), or other infrastructure services.
<br/><br/> Some of the network elements of the IPTV media system can be coupled to one or more computing devices 130 a portion of which can operate as a web server for providing portal services over an Internet Service Provider (ISP) network 132 to
wireline media devices 108 or wireless communication devices 116 by way of a wireless access base station 117 operating according to common wireless access protocols such as Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), or cellular communication technologies (such as GSM,
CDMA, UMTS, WiMAX, Software Defined Radio or SDR, and so on).
<br/><br/> The first communication system 100 can also include a recipient media device 135.  The recipient media device 135 can be communicatively linked to the ISP network 132, the one or more computing devices 130, and to other devices in the system
100.  Notably, the recipient media device 135 can be a STB, mobile device, personal computer, telephone, personal digital assistant (PDA), or other device capable of receiving and transmitting media content.  Furthermore, the recipient media device 135
can be configured to operate in an iTV network, which can include, but is not limited to including, IPTV, interactive cable television, and interactive satellite television.
<br/><br/> The recipient media device 135 can be configured to transmit requests for media content and commentary associated with the media content from devices in the system 100.  The commentary can be user-generated and can be in a temporal vicinity of
the associated media content.  The media content and associated commentary can come from devices such as, but is not limited to, STBs 106, media devices 108, and wireless communications device 116.  Notably, the media content and associated commentary
can include video content, audio content, still image content, text content, and other media content.  Additionally, the recipient media device 135 can be configured to receive and respond to requests from devices in the system 100 for media content and
commentary associated with the media content.  In responding to the requests from the devices, the recipient media device 135 can transmit media content and commentary associated with the recipient media device 135 to the requesting devices.
<br/><br/> Another distinct portion of the computing devices 130 can function as a server (herein referred to as server 130).  The server 130 can use common computing and communication technology to perform the function of receiving, transmitting,
maintaining, processing, and storing various types of content.  As mentioned above, such content can include video content, audio content, still image content, text content, and other content.  The server 130 can maintain a client program, which can be
downloaded and/or accessed by the devices in the system 100.  The client program can be configured to present an overlay that can be superimposed onto the media content and can allow users of the devices in the system 100 to associate a comment with
media content received at the devices.
<br/><br/> Additionally, the server 130 can be configured to receive requests for the media content and commentary associated with the media content from the devices in the system 100, such as the recipient media device 135 and the STBs 106.  Furthermore,
the server 130 can relay and/or store the actual media content and/or the commentary associated with the media content, and/or relay links to the media content and/or commentary associated with the media content to the devices in the system 100
requesting the content and/or commentary.
<br/><br/> It will be appreciated by an artisan of ordinary skill in the art that a satellite broadcast television system can be used in place of the IPTV media system.  In this embodiment, signals transmitted by a satellite 115 supplying media content can
be intercepted by a common satellite dish receiver 131 coupled to the building 102.  Modulated signals intercepted by the satellite dish receiver 131 can be submitted to the media processors 106 for generating broadcast channels which can be presented at
the media devices 108.  The media processors 106 can be equipped with a broadband port to the ISP network 132 to enable infrastructure services such as VoD and EPG described above.
<br/><br/> In yet another embodiment, an analog or digital broadcast distribution system such as cable TV system 133 can be used in place of the IPTV media system described above.  In this embodiment the cable TV system 133 can provide Internet, telephony,
and interactive media services.
<br/><br/> It follows from the above illustrations that the present disclosure can apply to any present or future interactive over-the-air or landline media content services.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 depicts an illustrative embodiment of a communication system 200 employing an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) network architecture to facilitate the combined services of circuit-switched and packet-switched systems.  Communication system
200 can be overlaid or operably coupled with communication system 100 as another representative embodiment of communication system 100.
<br/><br/> Communication system 200 can comprise a Home Subscriber Server (HSS) 240, a tElephone NUmber Mapping (ENUM) server 230, and other common network elements of an IMS network 250.  The IMS network 250 can establish communications between IMS
compliant communication devices (CD) 201, 202, Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) CDs 203, 205, and combinations thereof by way of a Media Gateway Control Function (MGCF) 220 coupled to a PSTN network 260.
<br/><br/> IMS CDs 201, 202 can register with the IMS network 250 by contacting a Proxy Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF) which communicates with a corresponding Serving CSCF (S-CSCF) to register the CDs with at the HSS 240.  To initiate a
communication session between CDs, an originating IMS CD 201 can submit a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP INVITE) message to an originating P-CSCF 204 which communicates with a corresponding originating S-CSCF 206.  The originating S-CSCF 206 can submit
queries to the ENUM system 230 to translate an E.164 telephone number in the SIP INVITE to a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) if the terminating communication device is IMS compliant.
<br/><br/> The SIP URI can be used by an Interrogating CSCF (I-CSCF) 207 to submit a query to the HSS 240 to identify a terminating S-CSCF 214 associated with a terminating IMS CD such as reference 202.  Once identified, the I-CSCF 207 can submit the SIP
INVITE to the terminating S-CSCF 214.  The terminating S-CSCF 214 can then identify a terminating P-CSCF 216 associated with the terminating CD 202.  The P-CSCF 216 then signals the CD 202 to establish communications.
<br/><br/> If the terminating communication device is instead a PSTN CD such as references 203 or 205, the ENUM system 230 can respond with an unsuccessful address resolution which can cause the originating S-CSCF 206 to forward the call to the MGCF 220
via a Breakout Gateway Control Function (BGCF) 219.  The MGCF 220 can then initiate the call to the terminating PSTN CD by common means over the PSTN network 260.
<br/><br/> The aforementioned communication process is symmetrical.  Accordingly, the terms "originating" and "terminating" in FIG. 2 are interchangeable.  It is further noted that communication system 200 can be adapted to support video conferencing by
way of common protocols such as H.323.  In addition, communication system 200 can be adapted to provide the IMS CDs 201, 203 the multimedia and Internet services of communication system 100.
<br/><br/> The server 130 of FIG. 1 can be operably coupled to the second communication system 200 for purposes similar to those described above.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 depicts an illustrative embodiment of a portal 302 which can operate from the computing devices 130 described earlier of communication 100 illustrated in FIG. 1.  The portal 302 can be used for managing services of communication systems
100-200.  The portal 302 can be accessed by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) with a common Internet browser such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer.TM.  using an Internet-capable communication device such as those described for FIGS. 1-2.  The portal 302
can be configured, for example, to access a media processor 106 and services managed thereby such as a Digital Video Recorder (DVR), a VoD catalog, an EPG, a personal catalog (such as personal videos, pictures, audio recordings, etc.) stored in the media
processor, provisioning IMS services described earlier, provisioning Internet services, provisioning cellular phone services, and so on.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 depicts an exemplary embodiment of a communication device 400.  Communication device 400 can serve in whole or in part as an illustrative embodiment of the communication devices of FIGS. 1-2.  The communication device 400 can comprise a
wireline and/or wireless transceiver 402 (herein transceiver 402), a user interface (UI) 404, a power supply 414, a location receiver 416, and a controller 406 for managing operations thereof.  The transceiver 402 can support short-range or long-range
wireless access technologies such as Bluetooth, WiFi, Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), or cellular communication technologies, just to mention a few.  Cellular technologies can include, for example, CDMA-1X, UMTS/HSDPA, GSM/GPRS,
TDMA/EDGE, EV/DO, WiMAX, SDR, and next generation cellular wireless communication technologies as they arise.  The transceiver 402 can also be adapted to support circuit-switched wireline access technologies (such as PSTN), packet-switched wireline
access technologies (such as TCPIP, VoIP, etc.), and combinations thereof.
<br/><br/> The UI 404 can include a depressible or touch-sensitive keypad 408 with a navigation mechanism such as a roller ball, joystick, mouse, or navigation disk for manipulating operations of the communication device 400.  The keypad 408 can be an
integral part of a housing assembly of the communication device 400 or an independent device operably coupled thereto by a tethered wireline interface (such as a USB cable) or a wireless interface supporting for example Bluetooth.  The keypad 408 can
represent a numeric dialing keypad commonly used by phones, and/or a Qwerty keypad with alphanumeric keys.  The UI 404 can further include a display 410 such as monochrome or color LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) or
other suitable display technology for conveying images to an end user of the communication device 400.  In an embodiment where the display 410 is touch-sensitive, a portion or all of the keypad 408 can be presented by way of the display.
<br/><br/> The UI 404 can also include an audio system 412 that utilizes common audio technology for conveying low volume audio (such as audio heard only in the proximity of a human ear) and high volume audio (such as speakerphone for hands free
operation).  The audio system 412 can further include a microphone for receiving audible signals of an end user.  The audio system 412 can also be used for voice recognition applications.  The UI 404 can further include an image sensor 413 such as a
charged coupled device (CCD) camera for capturing still or moving images.
<br/><br/> The power supply 414 can utilize common power management technologies such as replaceable and rechargeable batteries, supply regulation technologies, and charging system technologies for supplying energy to the components of the communication
device 400 to facilitate long-range or short-range portable applications.  The location receiver 416 can utilize common location technology such as a global positioning system (GPS) receiver for identifying a location of the communication device 400
based on signals generated by a constellation of GPS satellites, thereby facilitating common location services such as navigation.
<br/><br/> The communication device 400 can use the transceiver 402 to also determine a proximity to a cellular, WiFi or Bluetooth access point by common power sensing techniques such as utilizing a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and/or a signal
time of arrival (TOA) or time of flight (TOF).  The controller 406 can utilize computing technologies such as a microprocessor, a digital signal processor (DSP), and/or a video processor with associated storage memory such a Flash, ROM, RAM, SRAM, DRAM
or other storage technologies.
<br/><br/> The communication device 400 can be adapted to perform the functions of the media processor 106, the media devices 108, or the portable communication devices 116 of FIG. 1, as well as the IMS CDs 201-202 and PSTN CDs 203-205 of FIG. 2.  It will
be appreciated that the communication device 400 can also represent other common devices that can operate in communication systems 100-200 of FIGS. 1-2 such as a gaming console and a media player.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 depicts an illustrative embodiment of a system 500 for transmitting media content, the system 500 being operable in portions of the communications systems of FIGS. 1-2.  The system 500 can include one or more media devices 502, 504, and
506, which can be configured to deliver media content to display devices 508a-c and deliver and/or receive media content from server 510, communications device 512, and computing device 514.  The media devices 502, 504, and 506 can be STBs or other
similar media devices.  The display devices 508a-c can include any device capable of displaying and/or playing media content such as televisions, cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDA), computers, and the like.  The server 510 can be a device
including the operative features of server 130, among other features.  The communications device 512 can include, for example, a mobile device, a cellular phone, wireless device, or other communications device and the computing device 514 can be a
computer or laptop.
<br/><br/> The server 510 can be utilized to communicatively link the media devices 502 to the other devices of the system 500.  Notably, the server 510 can be configured to receive, transmit, maintain, and store various types of media content. 
Additionally, the server 510 can include a client program, which can be accessed, downloaded, and/or otherwise utilized by the devices in the system 500.  The client program can present an overlay that can be superimposed onto media content that is
displayed and/or received at the devices in the system 500.  Users of the client program can use the client program to associate commentary/comments with the media content accessed by the user.
<br/><br/> Users of the client program can select a portion of the media content and insert a comment in a temporal vicinity of the media content.  For example, if the user is watching a television show, the user can select a particular scene or segment,
or select a button which at the time the button is depressed creates a temporal association with a scene or segment of the show.  Responsive to this selection, the user can create a commentary by common means such as by keyboard input, or a microphone
that can captures speech which can be translated to text using common voice recognition techniques.  The commentary (or user-generated comment) in turn can be associated with the scene or segment at the particular point in time that the scene or segment
is shown.  Of course, multiple users experiencing the same media content (synchronously or asynchronously between the users) can each insert their own comments to associate with the media content as well.
<br/><br/> Referring now also to FIG. 6, a screenshot 600 illustrating commentary on a timeline associated with a media program, is illustratively shown.  The screenshot 600 features an overlay generated by the client program.  The overlay can include menu
buttons and other operative controls which are featured on the screenshot 600.  Notably, the overlay can include a timeline 601, which can reflect the entire duration of a media program playing at a user's media device.
<br/><br/> Screenshot 600 illustrates comments inserted at various points in the timeline 601 of the media program.  The iconic spheres in the screenshot 600 can indicate that a comment has been inserted at that particular point in the timeline 601 of the
media program.  For example, a single comment 602, a single comment 604, a single comment 606, and four comments 608 have been inserted into the timeline 601.  The comments can be textual or audible comments generated by the users.  Once the
user-generated comments are associated with their respective media segments, the user can utilize the client program to transmit the media content, commentary/comments, and/or links to the content and commentary to the server 510.  The server 510 can
redirect this information to other communication or computing devices 512, 514 if instructed by the users who generated such comments.
<br/><br/> The iconic symbols 603 and 605 can also represent commentaries, each having different meanings based on the shape of the symbol.  The iconic star 603 can represent, for example, a commentary to remind the user that something of interest or
importance to the user occurred in the media content at the time the star symbol was entered in the timeline 601.  This can be particularly useful in an educational setting.  For instance, the star symbol 603 can remind the user that the lecturer
presented something that the user can expect will be subject matter in a future examination.
<br/><br/> It should be noted that a presentation of media content in an education setting can represent both a visual presentation such as a presentation of slides (e.g., PowerPoint slides) as illustratively shown in reference 607 of FIG. 6 in addition to
an audio portion of speech by the lecturer.  When a user selects the star 603, for example, the slide page along with a portion of the audio relating to the slide page can be replayed.  This provides the user a prompt means to identify and replay
important visual and audio content.  It should be further noted, it is not necessary for the star symbol 603 to include a textual speech generated by the user.  The symbol itself can serve as a commentary that temporally points to visual and/or audio
content of interest or importance of some kind.
<br/><br/> The symbol 605 can, for example, represent a symbol for notes, which can be useful to indicate entries in the timeline representing a self-note to the user who generated its content rather than a shared commentary between users.  Self-notes or
star symbol commentaries do not have to be shared with other users.
<br/><br/> Any of the symbols on the timeline can be selectively chosen from a drop-down menu from one of the buttons shown in FIG. 6.
<br/><br/> The server 510 can be configured to access, store, and maintain the media content, commentary, and/or links to the media content and commentary.  Additionally, the server 510 can be configured to maintain information about the media content and
commentary.  If only the links to the media content are sent to the server 510, the server 510 can be configured to identify and extract the actual media content associated with the link.  Similarly, if only the links to the commentary are sent to the
server 510, the server 510 can be configured to extract the actual commentary associated with the link.
<br/><br/> The server 510 and/or the other devices in the system 500 can be configured to receive requests for the commentary and/or the media content from recipient media devices, which can be the devices in the system 500.  For example, media device 502
can transmit a request to server 510 for media content and commentary from communications device 512.  When the server 510 receives a request from a recipient media device, the server 510 can transmit at least a portion of the actual media content and
commentary and/or the links to the media content and commentary to the recipient media device.  If only the links are sent to the recipient media device, the recipient media device can access the media content and/or commentary via the links.
<br/><br/> The recipient media device can then be configured to present the media content and/or commentary through a display device, such as display devices 508a-c. Notably, the users of the recipient media device can utilize the client program much like
the users of the media devices generating the commentary.  Additionally, user-generated commentary and media content can be generated at the recipient media device and can be transmitted to other devices in the system 500 that request the commentary
and/or media content generated at the recipient media device.
<br/><br/> In an embodiment, the server 510 can prompt a media device, such as media devices 502, 504, and 506, to set a range of the media content to be transmitted to the server 510.  For example, the media device can set a range of the media content,
which is thirty seconds before and thirty seconds after any commentary associated with the media content.  Notably, the range can be defined by vertical start and end lines within the timeline of the media program that is presented by the client program,
such as those surrounding comment 604 in FIG. 6.  In another embodiment, the user of the media device can set the range without being prompted by the server 510.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 depicts an illustrative method 700 operating in portions of the communication systems of FIG. 1-2, and FIG. 5.  Method 700 can begin with step 702 in which a system such as server 510 presents an overlay combined with a presentation of
media content at each of a plurality of computing devices such as the media devices of FIG. 5.  For convenience and illustration purposes only, reference to the system in the flow diagram of FIG. 7 will be replaced with server 510, and reference to a
computing device will be replaced with a media device.  It will be appreciated that a system and a computing device can take on more than these illustrative embodiments.  With this in mind, in step 704, the server 510 can collect user-generated comments
as described earlier from each of the media devices.
<br/><br/> The server 510 in step 706 can use common pattern recognition techniques such as regression or other statistical models to detect a correlation between user-generated comments collected from the media devices.  A correlation can represent a
degree of similarity between commentaries.  The higher the degree of similarity, the higher the likelihood that media device users generating the user-generated commentaries have common interests, thereby representing a detectable behavioral pattern.
<br/><br/> Correlation can be determined for example by detecting similar commentaries having a near temporal relation.  For instance, the server 510 can detect negative, positive, or narrative commentaries having a temporal proximity to each other in
relation to the media content being presented.  For example suppose five users generate comments about a lecture in an educational setting which these users are commenting about.  Further suppose three out of the 6 users have comments indicating a lack
of understanding in relation to a segment of the lecture, while the other three have made commentaries that indicate a neutral or enhanced understanding of the same segment of the lecture.  Under these circumstances, the server 510 can determine from the
user-generated comments that three out of the 6 users may have a common need for tutoring or assistance from the lecturer or a third party.
<br/><br/> The server 510 can be programmed with varying degrees of sophistication to determine a correlation between user-generated comments.  For instance, the server 510 can be programmed to associate users having trouble comprehending educational
material with those who can provide assistance.  Such a setting can be established by the lecturer in order to assist students in need by matching them with other students who are not encountering the same challenges.  A simple algorithm such as this can
result in a more cohesive educational setting between students.  The server 510 can also identify correlations based on key words or phrases ("I'm confused", "did you get that?", "this will be on the final exam", "what", "confusing", etc.), demographic
or psychographic traits of each user directly or indirectly identified from the user-generated comments collected from the users.  These traits can be used to better pair students.  The server 510 can also be programmed to detect correlations which can
be subcategorized (e.g., high performer, under performer, sociable, introverted, etc.).
<br/><br/> It should be evident from these illustrations that there can be innumerable ways to identify correlations in user-generated comments, which can be useful in identifying users with interests and/or behaviors which may be complementary and/or team
building.  The present disclosure thereby contemplates all possible embodiments for correlating user-generated comments which may have use in an educational setting.
<br/><br/> When the server 510 detects correlation(s) in step 706, it can proceed to step 708 where it identifies clusters of correlated user-generated comments and an education aspect in each of the clusters.  The education aspect can be a correlated
understanding or lack of understanding in segments of the media content.  In this step the server 510 can identify the media devices or users thereof by clusters of correlated user-generated comments.  The media device and/or users can be identified by
any form of identifiable data (e.g., telephone number, user login, social security ID, biometric ID, STB identifier, SIP URI, static IP address, etc.).
<br/><br/> Once the media devices and/or users have been identified, the server 510 can be programmed to notify the users by transmitting a message to their respective media devices.  The message can indicate that a correlation has been detected which may
warrant establishing an educational social network if desired between the users having correlated commentaries.  In step 712, the server 510 can receive messages from the media devices initiated by the users indicating an interest or disinterest from the
identified users in joining the educational social network.
<br/><br/> In step 714, the server 510 can establish a social network according to the users indicating from their messages that they are interested in joining a social network based on the identified education aspect (e.g., group of students having a
mutual need for educational assistance from the lecturer or other fellow students).  In this step, the server 510 can create a virtual or adaptive educational social network 802 as shown in FIG. 8.  The social network can be adaptive in that the server
510 can be programmed to manage the inclusion or exclusion of users and their media devices over the course of time.
<br/><br/> The adaptive social network 802 can be implemented with common networking technology such as virtual private network (VPN) connections established between the identified media devices, or by other common networking techniques which can be
established through the networks of FIGS. 1-3.  The adaptive social network 802 can also be created by way of existing social networking applications such as FaceBook.TM., MySpace.TM., and so on.
<br/><br/> Once a social network has been established, the server 510 can continue to collect user-generated comments in step 716 from the users partaking in the adaptive educational social network 802 by way of their media devices.  In step 718, the
server 510 can determine if the user-generated comments indicate a decorrelation of interests between the users.  In this step the server 510 can monitor from the user-generated comments if one or more users in the adaptive social network 802 are not
getting along, have fallen out of grace with each other, or have demonstrated adverse interests or behavior.  If a decorrelation has been detected, and if the decorrelation appears to be long-term, the server 510 can be programmed in step 720 to
terminate the adaptive social network 802 in whole or in part.
<br/><br/> It should be noted that the adaptive social network 802 can also expand over time as the server 510 detects in steps 702-714 that other users may have similar interests.  When additional users with common interests are detected, the server 510
can inform the users in an already established educational social network whether they would be interested in adding additional parties.  When decorrelation is detected, the server 510 can also be programmed to inform the remaining users in the social
network with common interests whether they have a desire to remove the one or more users with the detected decorrelation.  The decision to remove one or more users (students) can be determined by majority vote, or other criteria established by the
educational social network.
<br/><br/> In step 722, the server 510 can also be programmed to compare the identified correlated user-generated comments to a threshold.  The threshold can for example represent an educational metric established by the lecturer.  The educational metric
can be used to detect behavior in the student body that the lecturer may be interested in. For example the lecturer may want to identify in real time when too many students are questing a portion of the presented materials (media content).  If the server
510 detects in step 722 that student inquiries for example exceed 20% of the class, then the server 510 can notify the lecturer in step 724 that the threshold has been reached.  The notice can be an iconic symbol such as reference 607 shown in FIG. 6,
which the lecturer may be able to readily see in a computer monitor during the slide presentation.  The lecturer may or may not know which students are making the inquiries.  Either way, the notice can provide the lecturer an opportunity in real time to
return to a segment of the presentation (the media content) to assist the portion of the students having trouble before continuing with subsequent portions of the lecture.
<br/><br/> Method 700 as described above can provide the lecturer and student body a closed system for enhancing the educational process.
<br/><br/> Upon reviewing the aforementioned embodiments, it would be evident to an artisan with ordinary skill in the art that said embodiments can be modified, reduced, or enhanced without departing from the scope and spirit of the claims described
below.  For example, the server 510 can be an integral part of a social networking application (e.g., MySpace).  In this embodiment, creating social networks of users based on a correlation of their user-generated comments can be kept within the
community of users utilizing the social networking application.  With the above technique, sub-groups of educational social networks can be created within the social network application.
<br/><br/> In addition to the aforementioned steps, an individual user of a media device can submit to the server 510 a request to identify other media devices and/or its respective users having user-generated comments that correlate to the user-generated
comments of the user submitting the request.  When receiving such a request, the server 510 can identify other users who have commented on the same media content, and thereafter perform correlation analysis as previously described.  The server 510 can
then compare the user-generated comments of all parties to determine which parties are likely to have common interests with the user submitting the request.  From this point forward, an educational social network can be established with the requesting
user in a manner similar to the above descriptions.
<br/><br/> Additionally, method 700 can be adapted so that all or a portion of the steps described above can be performed in a distributed system.  That is, the method can be implemented at each of the media devices without a server 510.  In this
embodiment, the media devices can be adapted to communicate amongst each other, share user-generated comments and assess whether correlations exist.  Once correlations are detected, messages can be submitted between the media devices to propose
invitations to an educational social network.
<br/><br/> It should be further noted that the media devices generating user-generated comments can be generally represented as computing devices of any form having the computing and communication resources to perform the aforementioned embodiments.  The
user-generated comments can be in many forms including without limitation text entered by a user, recorded speech, hand drawings entered on for example a computer tablet, or other detectable forms of communication.  Additionally, a computing device can
be a mobile phone, a lap top computer, a desktop computing, a gaming console, or any other device capable of establishing a communication session with another device and performing the embodiments of the present disclosure in whole or in part.
<br/><br/> Other suitable modifications can be applied to the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the claims below.  Accordingly, the reader is directed to the claims section for a fuller understanding of the breadth and scope of the
present disclosure.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 depicts an exemplary diagrammatic representation of a machine in the form of a computer system 900 within which a set of instructions, when executed, may cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed above. 
In some embodiments, the machine operates as a standalone device.  In some embodiments, the machine may be connected (e.g., using a network) to other machines.  In a networked deployment, the machine may operate in the capacity of a server or a client
user machine in server-client user network environment, or as a peer machine in a peer-to-peer (or distributed) network environment.
<br/><br/> The machine may comprise a server computer, a client user computer, a personal computer (PC), a tablet PC, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a control system, a network router, switch or bridge, or any machine capable of executing a set of
instructions (sequential or otherwise) that specify actions to be taken by that machine.  It will be understood that a device of the present disclosure includes broadly any electronic device that provides voice, video or data communication.  Further,
while a single machine is illustrated, the term "machine" shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set (or multiple sets) of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed
herein.
<br/><br/> The computer system 900 may include a processor 902 (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU, or both), a main memory 904 and a static memory 906, which communicate with each other via a bus 908.  The computer
system 900 may further include a video display unit 910 (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD), a flat panel, a solid state display, or a cathode ray tube (CRT)).  The computer system 900 may include an input device 912 (e.g., a keyboard), a cursor
control device 914 (e.g., a mouse), a disk drive unit 916, a signal generation device 918 (e.g., a speaker or remote control) and a network interface device 920.
<br/><br/> The disk drive unit 916 may include a machine-readable medium 922 on which is stored one or more sets of instructions (e.g., software 924) embodying any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein, including those methods
illustrated above.  The instructions 924 may also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory 904, the static memory 906, and/or within the processor 902 during execution thereof by the computer system 900.  The main memory 904 and
the processor 902 also may constitute machine-readable media.
<br/><br/> Dedicated hardware implementations including, but not limited to, application specific integrated circuits, programmable logic arrays and other hardware devices can likewise be constructed to implement the methods described herein.  Applications
that may include the apparatus and systems of various embodiments broadly include a variety of electronic and computer systems.  Some embodiments implement functions in two or more specific interconnected hardware modules or devices with related control
and data signals communicated between and through the modules, or as portions of an application-specific integrated circuit.  Thus, the example system is applicable to software, firmware, and hardware implementations.
<br/><br/> In accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure, the methods described herein are intended for operation as software programs running on a computer processor.  Furthermore, software implementations can include, but not limited
to, distributed processing or component/object distributed processing, parallel processing, or virtual machine processing can also be constructed to implement the methods described herein.
<br/><br/> The present disclosure contemplates a machine readable medium containing instructions 924, or that which receives and executes instructions 924 from a propagated signal so that a device connected to a network environment 926 can send or receive
voice, video or data, and to communicate over the network 926 using the instructions 924.  The instructions 924 may further be transmitted or received over a network 926 via the network interface device 920.
<br/><br/> While the machine-readable medium 922 is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium, the term "machine-readable medium" should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and/or
associated caches and servers) that store the one or more sets of instructions.  The term "machine-readable medium" shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the
machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present disclosure.
<br/><br/> The term "machine-readable medium" shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to: solid-state memories such as a memory card or other package that houses one or more read-only (non-volatile) memories, random access memories, or
other re-writable (volatile) memories; magneto-optical or optical medium such as a disk or tape; and/or a digital file attachment to e-mail or other self-contained information archive or set of archives is considered a distribution medium equivalent to a
tangible storage medium.  Accordingly, the disclosure is considered to include any one or more of a machine-readable medium or a distribution medium, as listed herein and including art-recognized equivalents and successor media, in which the software
implementations herein are stored.
<br/><br/> Although the present specification describes components and functions implemented in the embodiments with reference to particular standards and protocols, the disclosure is not limited to such standards and protocols.  Each of the standards for
Internet and other packet switched network transmission (e.g., TCP/IP, UDP/IP, HTML, HTTP) represent examples of the state of the art.  Such standards are periodically superseded by faster or more efficient equivalents having essentially the same
functions.  Accordingly, replacement standards and protocols having the same functions are considered equivalents.
<br/><br/> The illustrations of embodiments described herein are intended to provide a general understanding of the structure of various embodiments, and they are not intended to serve as a complete description of all the elements and features of apparatus
and systems that might make use of the structures described herein.  Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description.  Other embodiments may be utilized and derived therefrom, such that structural
and logical substitutions and changes may be made without departing from the scope of this disclosure.  Figures are also merely representational and may not be drawn to scale.  Certain proportions thereof may be exaggerated, while others may be
minimized.  Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.
<br/><br/> Such embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be referred to herein, individually and/or collectively, by the term "invention" merely for convenience and without intending to voluntarily limit the scope of this application to any single
invention or inventive concept if more than one is in fact disclosed.  Thus, although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it should be appreciated that any arrangement calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted
for the specific embodiments shown.  This disclosure is intended to cover any and all adaptations or variations of various embodiments.  Combinations of the above embodiments, and other embodiments not specifically described herein, will be apparent to
those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description.
<br/><br/> The Abstract of the Disclosure is provided to allow the reader to quickly ascertain the nature of the technical disclosure.  It is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the
claims.  In addition, in the foregoing Detailed Description, it can be seen that various features are grouped together in a single embodiment for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure.  This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as
reflecting an intention that the claimed embodiments require more features than are expressly recited in each claim.  Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive subject matter lies in less than all features of a single disclosed embodiment.  Thus
the following claims are hereby incorporated into the Detailed Description, with each claim standing on its own as a separately claimed subject matter.
