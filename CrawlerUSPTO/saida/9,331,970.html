<center><b><i>Claims</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>What is claimed is: <br/><br/> 1.  A method comprising: by one or more computing devices, receiving input from a user participating in a message session;  by the computing devices, detecting an emoticon in
the received input;  by the computing devices, analyzing a plurality of images associated with a user node in a social graph for a social-networking system, wherein the images are analyzed to detect expressions that correspond to an expression of the
typed emoticon, and wherein the user node represents the user;  by the computing devices, identifying, based on the analysis and a predefined mapping of emoticons to stored images in a data store of the social-networking system, a particular one of the
images corresponding to the emoticon;  and by the computing devices, replacing the emoticon with the particular one of the images in the message session.
<br/><br/> 2.  The method of claim 1, wherein the identifying the particular image further comprises receiving a selection of the particular image from a list suggested to the user.
<br/><br/> 3.  The method of claim 1, wherein the identifying the particular image comprises identifying the particular image based on a previous emoticon replacement with the particular image by the user.
<br/><br/> 4.  The method of claim 1, wherein the identifying an image corresponding to the emoticon comprises identifying the image from an image capture input device.
<br/><br/> 5.  The method of claim 1, wherein the emoticon is replaced with the particular image only if a second user has permission to view the particular image.
<br/><br/> 6.  The method of claim 1, wherein at least one of the computing devices is a server managing the message session.
<br/><br/> 7.  The method of claim 1, wherein the detecting comprises: analyzing text of the received input;  and identifying the emoticon based on the analysis of the text.
<br/><br/> 8.  One or more computer-readable non-transitory storage media in one or more computing systems, the media embodying logic that is operable when executed to: receive input from a user participating in a message session;  detect an emoticon in
the received input;  analyze a plurality of images associated with a user node in a social graph for a social-networking system, wherein the images are analyzed to detect expressions that correspond to an expression of the typed emoticon, and wherein the
user node represents the user;  identify based on the analysis and a predefined mapping of emoticons to stored images in a data store of the social-networking system, a particular one of the images corresponding to the emoticon;  and replace the emoticon
with the particular one of the images in the message session.
<br/><br/> 9.  The media of claim 8, wherein the identifying the particular image further comprises receiving a selection of the particular image from a list suggested to the user.
<br/><br/> 10.  The media of claim 8, wherein the identifying the particular image comprises identifying the particular image based on a previous emoticon replacement with the particular image by the user.
<br/><br/> 11.  The media of claim 8, wherein the identifying an image corresponding to the emoticon comprises identifying the image from an image capture input device.
<br/><br/> 12.  The media of claim 8, wherein the emoticon is replaced with the particular image only if a second user has permission to view the particular image.
<br/><br/> 13.  The media of claim 8, wherein at least one of the computing devices is a server managing the message session.
<br/><br/> 14.  The media of claim 8, wherein the detecting comprises: analyzing text of the received input;  and identifying the emoticon based on the analysis of the text.
<br/><br/> 15.  A first computing system comprising: a memory comprising instructions executable by one or more processors;  and the one or more processors coupled to the memory and operable to execute the instructions, the one or more processors being

<br/><br/> This disclosure generally relates to emoticons, in particular, replacing a typed emoticon with a user photo.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> A social-networking system, which may include a social-networking website, may enable its users (such as persons or organizations) to interact with it and with each other through it.  The social-networking system may, with input from a user,
create and store in the social-networking system a user profile associated with the user.  The user profile may include demographic information, communication-channel information, and information on personal interests of the user.  The social-networking
system may also, with input from a user, create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social-networking system, as well as provide services (e.g. wall posts, photo-sharing, event organization, messaging, games, or
advertisements) to facilitate social interaction between or among users.
<br/><br/> The social-networking system may send over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user.  A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of
the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social-networking system.  The social-networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user, such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other
users connected to the user.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a computing device, such as a server of a social-networking system, may analyze text of a message entered by a user participating in a message session to detect an emoticon in the text of the message session.  The
emoticon may, for example, be a character combination such as ":)" representing a smiley face.  The computing device, using the detected emoticon, may identify and access an image corresponding to the emoticon.  The image corresponding to the emoticon
may be an image of the user with an expression similar to the expression conveyed by the detected emoticon.  The image might also be any image the user has preselected to represent the expression conveyed by the detected emoticon.  The computing device
might also prompt the user to select an image.  The computing device may provide for display to a second user, such as a recipient of the message, the image in place of the emoticon within the text of the message.  The image may, for example, only be
displayed to the second user if the second user has permission to view the image. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

vice versa, where appropriate.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may be a network-addressable computing system that can host an online social network.  Social-networking system 160 may generate, store, receive, and send social-networking data, such as,
for example, user-profile data, concept-profile data, social-graph information, or other suitable data related to the online social network.  Social-networking system 160 may be accessed by the other components of network environment 100 either directly
or via network 110.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may include one or more servers 162.  Each server 162 may be a unitary server or a distributed server spanning multiple computers or multiple datacenters.  Servers 162 may be of
various types, such as, for example and without limitation, web server, news server, mail server, message server, advertising server, file server, application server, exchange server, database server, proxy server, another server suitable for performing
functions or processes described herein, or any combination thereof In particular embodiments, each server 162 may include hardware, software, or embedded logic components or a combination of two or more such components for carrying out the appropriate
functionalities implemented or supported by server 162.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 164 may include one or more data stores 164.  Data stores 164 may be used to store various types of information.  In particular embodiments, the
information stored in data stores 164 may be organized according to specific data structures.  In particular embodiments, each data store 164 may be a relational, columnar, correlation, or other suitable database.  Although this disclosure describes or
illustrates particular types of databases, this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of databases.  Particular embodiments may provide interfaces that enable a client system 130, a social-networking system 160, or a third-party system 170 to
manage, retrieve, modify, add, or delete, the information stored in data store 164.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may store one or more social graphs in one or more data stores 164.  In particular embodiments, a social graph may include multiple nodes--which may include multiple user nodes (each
corresponding to a particular user) or multiple concept nodes (each corresponding to a particular concept)--and multiple edges connecting the nodes.  Social-networking system 160 may provide users of the online social network the ability to communicate
and interact with other users.  In particular embodiments, users may join the online social network via social-networking system 160 and then add connections (e.g. relationships) to a number of other users of social-networking system 160 whom they want
to be connected to.  Herein, the term "friend" may refer to any other user of social-networking system 160 with whom a user has formed a connection, association, or relationship via social-networking system 160.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may provide users with the ability to take actions on various types of items or objects, supported by social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, the items
and objects may include groups or social networks to which users of social-networking system 160 may belong, events or calendar entries in which a user might be interested, computer-based applications that a user may use, transactions that allow users to
buy or sell items via the service, interactions with advertisements that a user may perform, or other suitable items or objects.  A user may interact with anything that is capable of being represented in social-networking system 160 or by an external
system of third-party system 170, which is separate from social-networking system 160 and coupled to social-networking system 160 via a network 110.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may be capable of linking a variety of entities.  As an example and not by way of limitation, social-networking system 160 may enable users to interact with each other as well as receive
content from third-party systems 170 or other entities, or to allow users to interact with these entities through an application programming interfaces (API) or other communication channels.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a third-party system 170 may include one or more types of servers, one or more data stores, one or more interfaces, including but not limited to APIs, one or more web services, one or more content sources, one or more
networks, or any other suitable components, e.g., that servers may communicate with.  A third-party system 170 may be operated by a different entity from an entity operating social-networking system 160.  In particular embodiments, however,
social-networking system 160 and third-party systems 170 may operate in conjunction with each other to provide social-networking services to users of social-networking system 160 or third-party systems 170.  In this sense, social-networking system 160
may provide a platform, or backbone, which other systems, such as third-party systems 170, may use to provide social-networking services and functionality to users across the Internet.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a third-party system 170 may include a third-party content object provider.  A third-party content object provider may include one or more sources of content objects, which may be communicated to a client system 130. 
As an example and not by way of limitation, content objects may include information regarding things or activities of interest to the user, such as, for example, movie show times, movie reviews, restaurant reviews, restaurant menus, product information
and reviews, or other suitable information.  As another example and not by way of limitation, content objects may include incentive content objects, such as coupons, discount tickets, gift certificates, or other suitable incentive objects.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 also includes user-generated content objects, which may enhance a user's interactions with social-networking system 160.  User-generated content may include anything a user can add, upload,
send, or "post" to social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user communicates posts to social-networking system 160 from a client system 130.  Posts may include data such as status updates or other textual data,
location information, photos, videos, links, music or other similar data or media.  Content may also be added to social-networking system 160 by a third-party through a "communication channel," such as a newsfeed or stream.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may include a variety of servers, sub-systems, programs, modules, logs, and data stores.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may include one or more of the following: a
web server, action logger, API-request server, relevance-and-ranking engine, content-object classifier, notification controller, action log, third-party-content-object-exposure log, inference module, authorization/privacy server, search module,
advertisement-targeting module, user-interface module, user-profile store, connection store, third-party content store, or location store.  Social-networking system 160 may also include suitable components such as network interfaces, security mechanisms,
load balancers, failover servers, management-and-network-operations consoles, other suitable components, or any suitable combination thereof.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may include one or more user-profile stores for storing
user profiles.  A user profile may include, for example, biographic information, demographic information, behavioral information, social information, or other types of descriptive information, such as work experience, educational history, hobbies or
preferences, interests, affinities, or location.  Interest information may include interests related to one or more categories.  Categories may be general or specific.  As an example and not by way of limitation, if a user "likes" an article about a
brand of shoes the category may be the brand, or the general category of "shoes" or "clothing." A connection store may be used for storing connection information about users.  The connection information may indicate users who have similar or common work
experience, group memberships, hobbies, educational history, or are in any way related or share common attributes.  The connection information may also include user-defined connections between different users and content (both internal and external).  A
web server may be used for linking social-networking system 160 to one or more client systems 130 or one or more third-party system 170 via network 110.  The web server may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing
messages between social-networking system 160 and one or more client systems 130.  An API-request server may allow a third-party system 170 to access information from social-networking system 160 by calling one or more APIs.  An action logger may be used
to receive communications from a web server about a user's actions on or off social-networking system 160.  In conjunction with the action log, a third-party-content-object log may be maintained of user exposures to third-party-content objects.  A
notification controller may provide information regarding content objects to a client system 130.  Information may be pushed to a client system 130 as notifications, or information may be pulled from client system 130 responsive to a request received
from client system 130.  Authorization servers may be used to enforce one or more privacy settings of the users of social-networking system 160.  A privacy setting of a user determines how particular information associated with a user can be shared.  The
authorization server may allow users to opt in or opt out of having their actions logged by social-networking system 160 or shared with other systems (e.g. third-party system 170), such as, for example, by setting appropriate privacy settings. 
Third-party-content-object stores may be used to store content objects received from third parties, such as a third-party system 170.  Location stores may be used for storing location information received from client systems 130 associated with users. 
Advertisement-pricing modules may combine social information, the current time, location information, or other suitable information to provide relevant advertisements, in the form of notifications, to a user.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 illustrates example social graph 200.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may store one or more social graphs 200 in one or more data stores.  In particular embodiments, social graph 200 may include multiple
nodes--which may include multiple user nodes 202 or multiple concept nodes 204--and multiple edges 206 connecting the nodes.  Example social graph 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 is shown, for didactic purposes, in a two-dimensional visual map representation. 
In particular embodiments, a social-networking system 160, client system 130, or third-party system 170 may access social graph 200 and related social-graph information for suitable applications.  The nodes and edges of social graph 200 may be stored as
data objects, for example, in a data store (such as a social-graph database).  Such a data store may include one or more searchable or queryable indexes of nodes or edges of social graph 200.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may correspond to a user of social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g. an enterprise, business, or third-party
application), or a group (e.g. of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over social-networking system 160.  In particular embodiments, when a user registers for an account with social-networking system 160, social-networking
system 160 may create a user node 202 corresponding to the user, and store the user node 202 in one or more data stores.  Users and user nodes 202 described herein may, where appropriate, refer to registered users and user nodes 202 associated with
registered users.  In addition or as an alternative, users and user nodes 202 described herein may, where appropriate, refer to users that have not registered with social-networking system 160.  In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may be
associated with information provided by a user or information gathered by various systems, including social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may provide his or her name, profile picture, contact information,
birth date, sex, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, or other demographic information.  In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to
information associated with a user.  In particular embodiments, a user node 202 may correspond to one or more webpages.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may correspond to a concept.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a concept may correspond to a place (such as, for example, a movie theater, restaurant, landmark, or city); a website (such
as, for example, a website associated with social-network system 160 or a third-party website associated with a web-application server); an entity (such as, for example, a person, business, group, sports team, or celebrity); a resource (such as, for
example, an audio file, video file, digital photo, text file, structured document, or application) which may be located within social-networking system 160 or on an external server, such as a web-application server; real or intellectual property (such
as, for example, a sculpture, painting, movie, game, song, idea, photograph, or written work); a game; an activity; an idea or theory; another suitable concept; or two or more such concepts.  A concept node 204 may be associated with information of a
concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems, including social-networking system 160.  As an example and not by way of limitation, information of a concept may include a name or a title; one or more images (e.g. an image of the
cover page of a book); a location (e.g. an address or a geographical location); a website (which may be associated with a URL); contact information (e.g. a phone number or an email address); other suitable concept information; or any suitable combination
of such information.  In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node 204.  In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may correspond to one or
more webpages.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a node in social graph 200 may represent or be represented by a webpage (which may be referred to as a "profile page").  Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social-networking system 160.  Profile pages may
also be hosted on third-party websites associated with a third-party server 170.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may
correspond to a particular concept node 204.  Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user node 202 may have a corresponding user-profile page in which the corresponding
user may add content, make declarations, or otherwise express himself or herself.  As another example and not by way of limitation, a concept node 204 may have a corresponding concept-profile page in which one or more users may add content, make
declarations, or express themselves, particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node 204.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a concept node 204 may represent a third-party webpage or resource hosted by a third-party system 170.  The third-party webpage or resource may include, among other elements, content, a selectable or other icon, or
other inter-actable object (which may be implemented, for example, in JavaScript, AJAX, or PHP codes) representing an action or activity.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a third-party webpage may include a selectable icon such as "like,"
"check in," "eat," "recommend," or another suitable action or activity.  A user viewing the third-party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons (e.g. "eat"), causing a client system 130 to send to social-networking system 160 a
message indicating the user's action.  In response to the message, social-networking system 160 may create an edge (e.g. an "eat" edge) between a user node 202 corresponding to the user and a concept node 204 corresponding to the third-party webpage or
resource and store edge 206 in one or more data stores.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a pair of nodes in social graph 200 may be connected to each other by one or more edges 206.  An edge 206 connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes.  In particular embodiments,
an edge 206 may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a first user may indicate that a second user is a "friend" of the first
user.  In response to this indication, social-networking system 160 may send a "friend request" to the second user.  If the second user confirms the "friend request," social-networking system 160 may create an edge 206 connecting the first user's user
node 202 to the second user's user node 202 in social graph 200 and store edge 206 as social-graph information in one or more of data stores 24.  In the example of FIG. 2, social graph 200 includes an edge 206 indicating a friend relation between user
nodes 202 of user "A" and user "B" and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes 202 of user "C" and user "B." Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges 206 with particular attributes connecting particular user
nodes 202, this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges 206 with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes 202.  As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge 206 may represent a friendship, family relationship, business or employment
relationship, fan relationship, follower relationship, visitor relationship, subscriber relationship, superior/subordinate relationship, reciprocal relationship, non-reciprocal relationship, another suitable type of relationship, or two or more such
relationships.  Moreover, although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected, this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected.  Herein, references to users or concepts being connected may, where appropriate, refer
to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph 200 by one or more edges 206.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, an edge 206 between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node 202 toward a concept associated with a concept node 204.  As an
example and not by way of limitation, as illustrated in FIG. 2, a user may "like," "attended," "played," "listened," "cooked," "worked at," or "watched" a concept, each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype.  A concept-profile page
corresponding to a concept node 204 may include, for example, a selectable "check in" icon (such as, for example, a clickable "check in" icon) or a selectable "add to favorites" icon.  Similarly, after a user clicks these icons, social-networking system
160 may create a "favorite" edge or a "check in" edge in response to a user's action corresponding to a respective action.  As another example and not by way of limitation, a user (user "C") may listen to a particular song ("Ramble On") using a
particular application (SPOTIFY, which is an online music application).  In this case, social-networking system 160 may create a "listened" edge 206 and a "used" edge (as illustrated in FIG. 2) between user nodes 202 corresponding to the user and concept
nodes 204 corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application.  Moreover, social-networking system 160 may create a "played" edge 206 (as illustrated in FIG. 2) between concept nodes 204
corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application.  In this case, "played" edge 206 corresponds to an action performed by an external application (SPOTIFY) on an external audio
file (the song "Imagine").  Although this disclosure describes particular edges 206 with particular attributes connecting user nodes 202 and concept nodes 204, this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges 206 with any suitable attributes connecting
user nodes 202 and concept nodes 204.  Moreover, although this disclosure describes edges between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 representing a single relationship, this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node 202 and a concept node 204
representing one or more relationships.  As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge 206 may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept.  Alternatively, another edge 206 may represent each type of relationship (or
multiples of a single relationship) between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 (as illustrated in FIG. 2 between user node 202 for user "E" and concept node 204 for "SPOTIFY").
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may create an edge 206 between a user node 202 and a concept node 204 in social graph 200.  As an example and not by way of limitation, a user viewing a concept-profile page (such as, for
example, by using a web browser or a special-purpose application hosted by the user's client system 130) may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node 204 by clicking or selecting a "Like" icon, which may cause the user's
client system 130 to send to social-networking system 160 a message indicating the user's liking of the concept associated with the concept-profile page.  In response to the message, social-networking system 160 may create an edge 206 between user node
202 associated with the user and concept node 204, as illustrated by "like" edge 206 between the user and concept node 204.  In particular embodiments, social-networking system 160 may store an edge 206 in one or more data stores.  In particular
embodiments, an edge 206 may be automatically formed by social-networking system 160 in response to a particular user action.  As an example and not by way of limitation, if a first user uploads a picture, watches a movie, or listens to a song, an edge
206 may be formed between user node 202 corresponding to the first user and concept nodes 204 corresponding to those concepts.  Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges 206 in particular manners, this disclosure contemplates forming
any suitable edges 206 in any suitable manner.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3A illustrates an example message session with a typed emoticon, and FIG. 3B illustrates an example message session where the typed emoticon is replaced with a user photo.  In particular embodiments, users of social-networking system 160
may communicate with one another via, for example, a messaging service.  The messaging service may be hosted by a server 162 of social-networking system 160 and may include a messaging interface that allows users of the social-networking system to send
each other messages including text and attachments (e.g. URLs, images, videos, or other files) in a message session.  A message session may encompass multiple messages (e.g. multiple lines of text, including attachments) between users.  A message session
may encompass communication between two users or a plurality of users.  A message session may encompass a single communication from a user who posts a message for other interested users of social-networking system 160 to view, such as a status update. 
In particular embodiments, the messaging interface may also include operability for users of the social-networking system to send each other messages including text and in-line images.  An example message in a messaging interface with operability
including in-line images is illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B.  These images may be taken from a variety of sources, including, for example, images available to the users within social-networking system 160, images on third party system 170 available over
communication network 110, or images available to client system 130.  Images available to client system 130 may also include images from an image capture device, such as a camera, accessible by client system 130.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a user of a messaging interface in social-networking system 160 may insert an emoticon into a line of text in a message by specifying a sequence of characters intended to emulate a facial expression.  Popular examples
are ":)" to represent a smile or ";)" to represent a wink.  Emoticons are not limited to facial expressions or a certain number of characters.  A more elaborate example is "@&gt;---&gt;---" representing a rose.
<br/><br/> In particular embodiments, a computing device such as message server 162 may detect an emoticon in the text of a message by analyzing the text of the received input.  Analyzing the text of the received input may include matching a portion of the
received text with text of known emoticons stored in data store 164.  Data store 164 of known emoticons may be populated by an administrator.  In other embodiments, the computing device may populate the known emoticons stored in data store 164 with a
user-defined list of emoticons or the computing device may automatically learn emoticons based on prior input of the same or other users.  For example, message server 162 may recognize ":)" as an emoticon because the user previously defined that
particular string as an emoticon or because the user previously replaced that particular string with an image.  Any suitable format for the emoticon may be used to indicate that the text string comprises an emoticon.  FIG. 3A illustrates an example in
which a single message session includes a user typed emoticon ":)".
<br/><br/> Within a line of text in a message, a user may type an emoticon, and a computing device such as message server 162 may replace the emoticon with an in-line image associated with the emoticon.  The image may be displayed within the line of text
to the user and also to a recipient of the message.  The image may be an image of the user with an expression similar to that of the typed emoticon, an image of any person with a similar expression, an image of a pet or other animal with a similar
expression, or any image the user or an administrator wants to associate with the emoticon.  The image may be a webpage hosted by a third-party system 170 on a server external to social-networking system 160.  The image may be an image associated with a
concept node 204, a user node 202, or any other object, including, by way of example and without limitation, a profile picture associated with a user, a photo in an album associated with a place or a user, or a specific image chosen by a user (or node
administrator) for use as a replacement for an emoticon.  The association of emoticons to images may be performed by message server 162 in real time.  For example, message server 162 may identify an image by analyzing all images associated with a user
node 202 for images with expressions that correspond to the expression of the typed emoticon.  Message server 162 may automatically replace the typed emoticon with an identified image, or it may present a selection of images to the user for
identification.  Message server 162 may store previous user identifications to make automatic future identifications or to present a selection of previously used images to a user for identification.  In another example, the user may store a predefined
mapping of emoticons to images in data store 164.  Message server 162 may identify an image received from an image capture device accessible by client system 130.  For example, the user may supply a contemporaneous photo with an expression matching that
of the emoticon for message server 162 to identify.  FIG. 3B illustrates an example of a single message session in which an image of a man smiling replaces the typed emoticon ":)" from FIG. 3A.
<br/><br/> The emoticon typed by the user identifies the image, such that an image associated with the emoticon may be fetched and displayed in-line based on the emoticon.  In particular embodiments, an API of the social-networking system may handle the
fetching or displaying of images in messages.  As an example, a message server 162 of social-networking system 160 may recognize that the sender of a message in a message session has typed an emoticon in the messaging interface.  In particular
embodiments, message server 162 of social-networking system 160 performs a check to identify an image corresponding to the emoticon.  If, for example, no image is associated with the emoticon, message server 162 may display the text string typed by the
user instead of displaying an image.  In another example, message server 162 may choose to display a default image identified by a system administrator.  In particular embodiments, the image displayed in the message may be fixed in size, and in other
embodiments, the image may be scaled based upon the text size of the message text.
<br/><br/> When the browser or other display interface of the recipient of the message containing an emoticon receives the message, the browser may construct (e.g. in JavaScript) an API query or method call for an image (with arguments based on the
emoticon in the message) to a server 162 of social-networking system 160.  The server may verify whether the method is valid, whether the recipient user browser has the permission to call the method, and whether the arguments are well-formed and
legitimate.  Based on this, the server 162 may construct a URL for the image and deliver the URL or image to the browser of the recipient of the message.  As described above, the recipient may see a text string or a default image if the emoticon does not
have an associated image.  Furthermore, the recipient user must have the adequate permissions as stored in social-networking system 160 to see the image.  For example, if a sender attempts to send a message with a user profile image that the recipient
does not have permission to see, the recipient may see a blank image, or any other suitable image, within the text due to lack of permission.
<br/><br/> Furthermore, although particular embodiments involving a messaging service have been discussed, replacing typed emoticons with user photos may be employed throughout social-networking system 160, wherever text is used to communicate.  As an
example, if a user comments on a post by another user (an example of an edge 206) of social-networking system 160, the comment may include emoticons.  Similarly, a post (such as a link or status update) may include emoticons.  Additionally, other types
of communication services, including email or chat services, may also include operability for replacing typed emoticons with user photos.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 illustrates an example method 400 for replacing a typed emoticon with an image.  The method may begin at step 410, where a computing device such as message server 162 of social-networking system 160 receives input from a user
participating in a message session.  The message session may comprise one or more messages including text.  The text may include an emoticon.  At step 420, the computing device detects the emoticon in the received input.  At step 430, the computing
device identifies an image corresponding to the emoticon.  The computing device accesses the image corresponding to the emoticon at step 440 and replaces the emoticon with the image in the message session at step 450.  Particular embodiments may repeat
one or more steps of the method of FIG. 4, where appropriate.  Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of FIG. 4 as occurring in a particular order, this disclosure contemplates any suitable steps of the method
of FIG. 4 occurring in any suitable order.  Moreover, although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components, devices, or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of FIG. 4, this disclosure contemplates any suitable
combination of any suitable components, devices, or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of FIG. 4.
