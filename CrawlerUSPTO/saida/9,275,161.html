       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> An enterprise activity pattern analysis system retrieves log data from a
     social networking system. The log data includes information
     characterizing user interactions with a team group space hosted by, or
     document uploaded to, the social networking system. The system analyzes
     the log data to detect patterns in the user interactions. The system
     embeds widgets into the group space and into the documents uploaded to
     the social networking system that provide visual representations of the
     pattern analysis.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 shows an example of an enterprise activity pattern analysis architecture 100 ("architecture 100") for facilitating enhanced collaboration using a social network platform.  The architecture 100 includes an enterprise activity pattern
analysis system 102, a social network system 104, and user portals 106, each of which is configured to communicate over any number or variety of communications network(s) 108.  The user portals 106 may correspond to members of a project team or
collaboration group using client applications, or other computer software applications, to perform a project or other activity.  The client applications executed by the user portals 106 may be augmented via software plugins and widgets that provide
activity pattern analysis and social collaboration functionality for the software applications.  As examples, the client applications may include an enterprise social group space built on the social networking system 104.  The client applications may
also be an office suite application, e.g., Microsoft Office.RTM., WordPerfect Office.RTM., etc., or any other computer software applications.  Alternatively or additionally, the user portals 106 may execute software natively written to provide the social
collaboration functionality.
<br/><br/> The user portals 106 may take many different forms.  As examples, the user portals 106 may be smart phones, laptop computers, personal data assistants, pocket computers, tablet computers, portable email devices, or processes executed in memory
by a processor.  The user portals 106 may be found in virtually any context, including the home, business, public spaces, or automobile.
<br/><br/> The activity pattern analysis system 102 analyzes and detects patterns in log data received from the social networking system 104 or from the client application itself.  The log data may include activity data and/or structural/relationship data. Table 1 provides examples of the information that may be included in the activity data.  Table 2 provides examples of the information that may be included in the structural/relationship data.

<br/><br/> The activity pattern analysis system 102 enhances the client applications visualizing the patterns detected in the log data and embedding those visualizations into the client applications as, for example, customized widgets.  The activity
pattern analysis system 102 may include communication interfaces 110 that connect the activity pattern analysis system 102 to the networks 108, system logic 112, and a user interface 114.  The user interface 114 may display a graphical user interface
116.  The user interface 114 facilitates setup, configuration, and monitoring of the activity pattern analysis system 102.
<br/><br/> The system logic 112 implements in hardware, software, or both, any of the processing, user interfaces, reports, and other aspects of the system shown or described below or in the Figures.  As one example, the system logic 112 may include one or
more processors 118 and program and data memories 120.  The program and data memories 120 hold, for example, collaboration instructions 122.  The data and program memories 120 may also hold collaboration configuration parameters 124 that guide the
operation of the collaboration system 112.  The system logic 112 may also include one or more connectors, implemented in hardware and/or software that pull log data from the social networking system 104.  The connectors may retrieve a dynamic stream of
log data from the social networking system 104, or may access a data warehouse maintained by the social networking system that stores log data.  The log data pulled from the dynamic feed may include more recent activity data, e.g., the past month, week,
etc., while the data pulled from the data warehouse may extend farther back in time.  The system may instruct the connectors to pull data from either source based on the type of widget being used.  For example, some widgets discussed below provide
analysis of data beginning with the creation of the analyzed content.  For these widgets, the system may instruct the connectors to pull log data from the data warehouse.  In other instances, only more recent log data may be relevant.
<br/><br/> The processors 118 execute the collaboration instructions 122, and the configuration parameters 124 may inform the processors 118 as to how to handle the specific aspects of the collaboration processing described below and shown in the drawings. As a result, the processors 118 and collaboration instructions 122 implement the collaboration techniques described below and shown in the Figures.  The activity pattern analysis system 102 may accept input from the user interface 114 to change, view,
add, or delete any of the configuration parameters 124 at any time.
<br/><br/> The social networking system 104 may be Jive.RTM., Tibbr.RTM., Moxie.RTM., Chatter.RTM., Yammer.RTM., Newsgator.RTM.  or other social network/micro-blogging systems.  The social networking system 104 may host the client applications, as well as
documents related to an enterprise social group space built on the social networking system 104.  As users, via the user portals 106, interact with the enterprise social group space or documents uploaded to the group space, the social networking system
104 generates and provides the log data discussed above used by the system 102 for pattern analysis.
<br/><br/> The social networking system 104 also generates updates based on the received event information and pushes the updates back to the activity pattern analysis system 102, or populates activity feeds embedded into the group space built on the
social networking system.  When the activity pattern analysis system 102 receives updates, it populates collaboration interfaces 126.  While the collaboration interfaces 126 may appear on the GUI 116, the activity pattern analysis system 102 may also
push the collaboration interfaces 126 (or updates thereto) to the user portals 106 over the networks 108.
<br/><br/> The activity pattern analysis system 102 may populate multiple collaboration interfaces, each corresponding to a different user or user portal 106.  For example, if a user completes a task or edits a document, the activity pattern analysis
system 102 may send updates to the collaboration interfaces of other users that are part of the user's project team or collaboration group.
<br/><br/> The activity pattern analysis system 102 may communicate with social networking system 104 through a communications network 108.  The communications network 110 may be any private or public communications network or combination of networks.  The
communications network 108 connects devices, such as the user portals 106, servers, systems, databases, or other network enabled devices, to other such devices, and thereby supports data communication between the connected devices.  The communications
network 108 may generally be enabled to employ any form of computer-readable media for communicating information from one computing device to another.  The communications network 108 may include one or more of a wireless network, a wired network, a local
area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a direct connection such as through a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port, and the like, and may include the set of interconnected networks that make up the Internet.  The communications network 108 may execute
any communication method by which information may travel between computing devices.
<br/><br/> The user portals 106 may access the activity pattern analysis system 102 via the communications network 110, for example, using a browser application.  A browser based implementation allows system features to be accessible regardless of the
underlying platform of the user portals 106.  For example, the user portals 106 may each be a desktop, laptop, handheld computer, cell phone, mobile messaging device, network enabled television, digital video recorder, automobile, or other network
enabled user portal, which may use a variety of hardware and/or software packages.  The user portals 106 may also connect to the activity pattern analysis system 102 and social network system 104 using a stand-alone application which may be
platform-dependent or platform-independent.
<br/><br/> The activity pattern analysis system 102 may be implemented in many different ways.  For example, although some features may be shown or described as stored in computer-readable memories (e.g., as logic implemented as computer-executable
instructions or as data structures in memory), all or part of the activity pattern analysis system 102 and its logic and data structures may be stored on, distributed across, or read from other machine-readable media.  The media may include hard disks,
floppy disks, CD-ROMs, a signal, such as a signal received from a network or received over multiple packets communicated across the network.
<br/><br/> The activity pattern analysis system 102 may be implemented with additional, different, or fewer components.  As one example, a processor may be implemented as a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a DSP, an application specific integrated
circuit (ASIC), discrete logic, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic.  As another example, memories may be DRAM, SRAM, Flash or any other type of memory.  The processing capability of the activity pattern analysis system 102 may be
distributed among multiple components, such as among multiple processors and memories, optionally including multiple distributed processing systems.  Parameters, databases, and other data structures may be separately stored and managed, may be
incorporated into a single memory or database, may be logically and physically organized in many different ways, and may implemented with different types of data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, or implicit storage mechanisms.  Logic, such
as programs or circuitry, may be combined or split among multiple programs, distributed across several memories and processors, and may be implemented in a library, such as a shared library (e.g., a dynamic link library (DLL)).  The DLL, for example, may
store code that performs the collaboration processing described in this document and shown in the Figures.
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 shows an example of an enterprise social group space 200 built on a social collaboration system enhanced with a custom widget 202.  For the sake of explanation, the application discusses a group space built on Jive.RTM., but it will be
understood that other social networking platforms, such as those mentioned previously, may be used.  An activity pattern analysis system, such as the system 102, determines, based on an analysis of log data received from the Jive.RTM.  platform, recent
users and their contributions, as well as their most frequently contributed Jive.RTM.  content from the deployed container in a web page.  The system publishes the determined information to the widget 202 embedded into the group space 200.  The widget
202 may be configurable by admin to adjust the widget 202 height and labels.  The widget may also include a configurable filter to restrict/allow the contents from the sub containers.  The log data received from Jive.RTM., e.g., from a Jive.RTM. 
activity manager service, includes a list of recent activities in a container, which provides a list of recent contents.  If the administrator configures the widget 202 to select the recent activities from sub-containers like subspaces and projects, the
system may use an activity manager service to retrieve the recent contents in the sub containers.  The system, using the widget 202, finds the unique users in the filtered content list along with their recent content and most frequently worked content,
thus providing a list of users and content details shown in the widget 202.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 shows a process 300 by which the system may analyze log data from the social networking system to generate the information presented in the widget 202.  The system iterates a content list received with the log data to fetch each content
object (302).  For the current content object, the system determines whether the content type is a document, blogs, or discussions type (304).  If the current content type is of the document, blogs or discussion content type, the system fetches the
content activity users and their activity date using the respective Jive.RTM.  services (306).  Activity users are users who have contributed in jive content in the form of create, edit or provide comments.  The system maintains a user list for each
content object.  The system retrieves the user list corresponding to the current content object (308).  The system iterates the recent activity users to retrieve each recent user associated with the current content object (310).  For each user, the
system verifies whether the user already exists in the user list (312).
<br/><br/> If the current user already exists in the user list, the system verifies whether the current content is already mapped to the user (314).  If the current content is already mapped to the current user, the system increments a contribution count
associated with the content by one (316).  The system also verifies the content modification date of the current content with existing entries (318).  If the modification date for the current content more recent than an existing entry, the system updates
the modification date for the current content to be the current content's modification date.  If the modification date for the current content is not more recent than an existing entry, the system maintains the modification date of the existing entry as
the modification date for this content.
<br/><br/> If the current content is not mapped to the current user, the system maintains the modification date and the contribution count in the user list (320).  If the current user is not present in the user list, the system adds the current user and
the contribution date of the current user to the user list associated with the current content object (322), The system also sets a contribution count for the current user to one (324).
<br/><br/> If the system has iterated through the user list, the system moves to the next content object in the content list.  Once the iteration of the content list is complete, the system sorts the content list of each user based on contribution count
(326).  In the event of a tie, i.e., equal contribution count, the system sorts the content list based on modification date.  In other words, if two entries in the list have the same contribution count, the entry with the more recent modification date
will be listed on top as between the two.  The system presents the sorted list in the widget 202 to display the user and the frequently contributed content, with the most frequently contributed-to content being listed first.  The system sorts the content
list of each user based on modification date (328).  In the event of a tie, i.e., content with the same modification date, the system may look at the time of modification, if available, or may resolve such a tie based on contribution count.  The system
presents this sorted list in the widget 202 to display the user and the recently contributed content, with the most recently modified content being listed first.
<br/><br/> As shown in FIG. 2, the widget includes radio buttons that allow the user to select between the two lists.  When the user first opens the group page 200, the widget 202 may be configured to default to one list or the other.  The system may also
be configured to automatically update the widget with updated lists as the system processes new log data from the social networking system.  In other words, the widget 202 may be configured to update or refresh with new information even while the user is
using the group space page 200.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 shows another example of an enterprise social group space 400 built on a social collaboration system enhanced with a custom widget 402.  Through the widget 402 the system allows a user of the group space 400 to retrieve and display recent
Jive.RTM.  contents 404, 406, 408 and the respective participated users 410, 412, 414, 416 within the deployed container.  The contents 404, 406, 408 are displayed based on the descending order of user contribution count for the Jive content.  The widget
402 identifies which users have contributed to which contents.  Where there is more than one user that has contributed to a content, e.g., users 410 and 416 are both associated with content 406, the widget lists those users in descending order of number
of participations.  If there is a tie, the widget may show the user with the most recent participation.  Where there are more users that have contributed to content than can fit in the widget display area, the widget 402 may show the users that have the
most recent contributions.  For example, if five users have contributed to certain content, but there is only room to display three, the system may show the three users with the most recent contribution.  The widget 402 may be configurable by an
administrator to adjust the widget height, labels and the background color.  An administrator also has the provision to include the filter to restrict/allow the contents from the sub containers.
<br/><br/> The log data received from Jive.RTM., e.g., from a Jive.RTM.  activity manager service, includes a list of recent activities in a container, which provides a list of recent contents.  This service may be used to retrieve the list of recent
contents.  If the administrator configures the widget 402 to select the recent activities from sub-containers like subspaces and projects, the system may use an activity manager service to retrieve the recent contents in the sub containers.  The widget
402 finds all the recent Jive.RTM.  contents and the user participation list for each of the jive content based on the contribution count and the most recent participation date.
<br/><br/> FIG. 5 shows a process 500 by which the system may analyze log data from the social networking system to generate the information presented in the widget 402.  The system iterates a content list received with the log data to fetch each content
object (502).  For the current content object, the system determines whether the content type is a document, blogs, or discussions type (504).  If the current content type is of the document, blogs or discussion content type, the system fetches recent
activity users and their contribution date to the content using the respective Jive.RTM.  services (506).  Activity users may be users who have contributed the current content in the form of, for example, creating, editing or providing comments.  The
system maintains a user list for each content object.  The system retrieves the user list corresponding to the current content object (508).  The system iterates the recent activity users to retrieve each recent user associated with the current content
object (510).  For each user, the system verifies whether the user already exists in the user list (512).
<br/><br/> If the current user already exists in the user list, the system increments a contribution count associated with that user, for that content, by one (514).  The system also verifies the contribution date of the current user with a previous
contribution date of that user for the current content (516).  If the contribution date of the current content by the current user is more recent than a previous contribution date of the content by the current user, the system updates the contribution
date for the user in the user list to be the current modification date.
<br/><br/> If the current user is not present in the user list, the system adds the current user and the contribution date of the current user to the user list associated with the current content object (518).  The system also sets a contribution count for
the current user to one (520).
<br/><br/> If the system has iterated through the recent activity users, the system moves to the next content object in the content list.  Once the iteration of the content list is complete, the system sorts the content list of each user based on total
contribution count (522).  In the event of a tie, i.e., equal contribution count, the system sorts the content list based on modification date.  In other words, if two entries in the list have the same contribution count, the entry with the more recent
modification date will be listed on top as between the two.  The system presents the sorted list in the widget 402 to display the user and the frequently contributed content, with the most frequently contributed-to content being listed first.  The system
sorts the content list in decreasing order of contribution count (524).  The system presents the sorted content in the widget 402 to display the user and the unique contents and contributing users.  The widget 402 identifies the users in the form of
avatars, but it will be understood that the users may be identified by name or by other mechanisms.
<br/><br/> FIG. 6 shows an example of content 600 of a social networking system enhanced with a custom widget 602.  The widget 602 displays the unique contributors to the Jive.RTM.  content, e.g., to a document, blog, or discussion, in the form of user
avatars 604, 606, 608 on the Jive.RTM.  content side panel 610.  This list will include users that have created/edited/commented on this content 600 since the content was created.  For the sake of explanation, the content in FIG. 6 is a document, but it
will be understood the content can be of other types, such as blogs or discussions.  The order in which the users are displayed may be according to the type of contribution made to the document 600.  For example, the initial creator may be listed first,
followed by users that made edits to the document, and then by users that added comments to the document.  If the total number of users to be shown is more the number of slots that can fit in the widget 602, the system causes the widget to show the first
X-1 individuals, where X is the number of slots that can fit in the window.  The final slot may be represented by a blank box and on hover the box, a window pops up with all contributing users, or with all of the remaining contributing users.  For
example, if the widget has four slots, and there are five contributing users, the widget displays the first three contributing users and leaves the fourth slot blank.  On hover the box, a window pops up with all five contributed users or with the
remaining two contributing users.
<br/><br/> Where the content is a document, the system receives the document author and a list of activity authors, as well as a list of users who have commented on the document, from the log data provided by the social networking system.  Where the
content is a discussion, the system receives from the log data an identification of a main discussion creator and an identification of the users that have replied to the main thread.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 shows a process 700 by which the system may analyze log data from the social networking system to generate the information presented in the widget 602 where the content is a document.  The system obtains an identification of a document
author form the log data (702).  The system adds the user to a document contributor list associated with the document (704).  The system may maintain a document contributor list for each document.  The system obtains an identification of document
activity authors to fetch the users who have edited the document (706).  Document activity authors may be authors that have edited the document.
<br/><br/> The system iterates through the list of activity authors to fetch the corresponding user data (708).  For each activity author, the system determines whether the corresponding user already exists in the document contributor list (710).  If the
user does not exist in the document contributor list, the system adds the user to the document contributor list (712).  If the user already exists in the document contributor lists, the system advances to the next activity author until the system has
iterated through all activity authors.
<br/><br/> The system obtains a list of commenting users from the log data (714).  The system iterates through the list of activity authors to fetch the corresponding user data (716).  For each commenting user, the system determines whether the commenting
user already exists in the document contributor list (718).  If the user does not exist in the document contributor list, the system adds the user to the contributor list (720).  If the user already exists in the document contributor list, the system
advances to the next commenting user until the system has iterated through all commenting users.  The system may maintain a flag or other key associated with each user in the document contributor list to identify which users in the list is the document
creator, an editing user, or a commenting user.  The system publishes the data in the document contributor list as the widget 602.  The order in which the contributor are presented may be based on the type of user the contributor is, i.e., author,
editor, commenter.  The system retrieves avatars associated with each of the contributing users and displays the avatars in the order determined by the above analysis (722).
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 shows a process 800 by which the system may analyze log data from the social networking system to generate the information presented in the widget 602 where the content is a discussion.  The system obtains an identification of the
discussion author, or creator, from the log data (802).  The system adds the discussion author, or creator, to a discussion contributor list (804).  The system may maintain a discussion contributor list for each discussion.
<br/><br/> The system obtains a list of users that have replied to the discussion from the log data (806).  The system iterates through the list of replying users to fetch the corresponding user data (808).  For each replying user, the system determines
whether the user already exists in the discussion contributor list (810).  If the user does not exist in the discussion contributor list, the system adds the user to the list (812).  If the user already exists in the discussion contributor list, the
system advances to the next replying user until the system has iterated through all replying users.  The system publishes the data in the discussion contributor list as the widget 602 onto the corresponding discussion page of the social networking system
(814).  The system retrieves avatars associated with each of the users.  The discussion creator may be listed first, followed by replying users.  The replying users may be presented in ascending or descending order based on the date of their most recent
reply.
<br/><br/> FIG. 9 shows another example of content 900 of a social networking system enhanced with a custom widget 902 on the Jive.RTM.  document side panel 904.  Similar to the widget 602, the widget 902 may be embedded into social networking content,
such as into a document or discussion.  The content shown in FIG. 9 is a document.
<br/><br/> The widget 902 provides a graph with a real-time interactive visualization.  In particular, the widget 902 provides a time vs.  contribution score graph for each user.  The x-axis corresponds to time, with the starting point of the x-axis being
the creation of the document and the ending point being the date the document is being viewed.  The y-axis corresponds to a contribution score.  The contribution score is calculated per day, per user; it is the sum of points assigned to each contributing
user, per day, based on whether the user is the document creator or has edited or commented on the document.  The following is an example of the point scheme that may be employed: If a user is the initial creator, the user gets 4 points assigned on the
creation date; if a user edits that document, the user gets 3 points for each edit assigned on the edit date; and if a person comments on the document, the user gets 2 point for each comment assigned on the comment date.  Where the content is a
discussion, the point scheme may assign points for creation of the discussion and points for replying to the discussion.
<br/><br/> The log data, provided by the Jive.RTM.  document manager and comment manager, includes user details and activity data.  The widget 902 processes the data to get the X co-ordinate and the respective contribution score for each user.  The widget
902 may passes the processed data to high chart jquery script to display the graph.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 10-11 show a process 1000 by which the system may analyze log data from the social networking system to generate the information presented in the widget 902 where the content is a document.  For the sake of explanation, the process 1000 is
described as having a contribution score point scheme of four points for document creation, three points for editing, and two points for commenting, but it will be understood that other point schemes may be used.
<br/><br/> The system obtains log data from the social networking system (1002), and extracts document creation data from the log data (1004).  The document creation data may include the document creator, the document creation date, and a last modification
date.  The system adds the document creator to a user list associated with the document (1006) and assigns a contribution score of four to the user on the document creation date (1008).
<br/><br/> The system obtains a list of activity users and activity dates corresponding to the document (1010).  An activity user is a user that has edited the document.  The system iterates through the list of activity users to retrieve each user and
activity date (1012).  For each user, the system determines whether the user already exists in the user list (1014).  If user exists, the system identifies the activity dates corresponding to the user, i.e., each date on which the user edited the
document, and determines how many edits the activity user made on each activity date corresponding to the user (1016).  If the user has made multiple edits on a given activity date, the system assigns a contribution score for that user on that date equal
to three times the number of edits made that given date (1018).  For activity dates on which the activity user made one edit, the system assigns a contribution score of three for that user on that date (1020).  If the user does not exist in the user
list, the system adds the user to the user list (1022) and then performs steps 1016-1020.
<br/><br/> The system obtains a list of comment users and comment dates corresponding to the document from the log data (1024).  A comment user is a user that has commented on the document.  The system iterates through the list of comment users to retrieve
each user and comment date (1026).  For each comment user, the system determines whether the comment user already exists in the user list (1028).  If comment user exists in the user list, the system identifies the comment dates corresponding to the
comment user, i.e., each date on which the user commented on the document, and determines how many commenting contributions the comment user made on each activity date (1030).  If the comment user has made multiple commenting contributions on a given
activity date, the system increases a contribution score for that user on that date by two times the number of comment contributions made that given date (1032).  For comment dates on which the comment user made one contribution, the system increases a
contribution score for that user on that comment date by two (1034).  If the comment user does not exist in the user list, the system adds the comment user to the user list (1036) and then performs steps 1030-1034.  According to the above, if a user
edited and commented on the document on the same date, the user would have a contribution score of five for that date.
<br/><br/> The system determines the ticks to be displayed on the x-axis of the graph in the widget 902 (1038).  The system determines the number of users in the user list (1040).  If there are more than five users in the user data list, the system sort
the list based on contribution score in the descending order and retrieves contribution scores for the first four users (1042).  The system designates the remaining users as "Others" and sums the contribution score for "Others" for each activity date
(1044).  The system passes the processed data (collaboration scores per date for the first four users and the cumulative scores per date for the "Others") to the jquery highchart JavaScript file and displays the resulting graph to the widget 902 (1046).
<br/><br/> FIG. 12 shows parallel team activity streams 1202, 1204, 1206, embedded into a page 1200 of a group space built on a social networking system.  The system obtains location and activity data from the log data and separates the data by location
such that each activity stream corresponds to a different location.  Each activity stream also categorizes the type of activity being populated to the feed.  FIG. 12 shows three types of activity: meeting notes 1208, proposal 1210, and workshop related
1212.  Each type of activity is characterized by a color shading, and each feed item related to a particular activity type is overlaid with a box or other shape of the appropriate color.  The activity type may be determined manually user that is the
subject of the feed entry, or may parse the text of feed entry to determine what type of activity is involved.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 shows two instances 1300 and 1302 of an intra-team collaborative topology visualizer widget.  The widget illustrates collaboration patterns within a project team over a different time period.  The widget includes avatars 1304, 1306,
1308, 1310, 1312, 1314 corresponding to each team member.  The lines between team members illustrate which team members have been collaborating on the same work product, and illustrates the group structure and how projects being worked on.  The system
determines where to draw the lines based on a pattern analysis of the log data received from one or more social networking platforms.  The system determines the collaboration relationship over multiple time periods.  In FIG. 13, a user can select a
collaboration relationship from two months prior, one month prior or the current collaboration relationship.  The instance 1300 of the widget shows a collaboration relationship from two months prior, while the instance 1302 of the widget shows a
collaboration relationship from one month prior.
<br/><br/> FIG. 14 shows recommendations widget 1402 that may be embedded into a group space 1400 built on a social networking platform.  The widget 1402 provides a prioritized feed of recommended content 1404 to the user.  The feed is sorted in order of
relevance to the user, with the most relevant content, as determined by the system's pattern analysis, being listed as the first entry in the feed.  The feed may be tailored to the user.  In other words, the prioritized feed may be different based on
which user is logged into and viewing the group space.  The system analyzes collaboration patterns based on the log data to determine which content, and which authors, is relevant to which users, and prioritizes the feed based on that analysis.  For
example, the system determines that two users frequently work on the same work product.  Accordingly, the top of each user's prioritized feed may include recommendations to review the other user's work product.  The prioritized feed may also be based on
