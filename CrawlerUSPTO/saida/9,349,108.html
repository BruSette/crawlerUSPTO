reserved ticket purchase transaction relating to a purchase of at least one reserved ticket for the first upcoming event.
<br/><br/> 2.  The computer implemented method of claim 1 further comprising causing the at least one processor to execute additional instructions for: causing at least one component of the computer network to enable the first end user to reserve, via use
of the Ticketing GUI, a first set of reserved tickets for the first upcoming event;  and wherein the at least one purchased ticket corresponds to at least one reserved ticket from the first set of reserved tickets.
<br/><br/> 3.  The computer implemented method of claim 1 wherein the funding of the at least one reserved ticket purchase transaction includes causing at least one component of the computer network to automatically fund, using a funding source provided by
the first end user, a first reserved ticket purchase transaction relating to a purchase of a first reserved ticket for the first end user for the first upcoming event.
<br/><br/> 4.  The computer implemented method of claim 1 further comprising causing the at least one processor to execute additional instructions for: causing at least one component of the computer network to enable the first end user to reserve, via use
of the Ticketing GUI, a first set of reserved tickets for the first upcoming event;  wherein the funding of the at least one reserved ticket purchase transaction includes causing at least one component of the computer network to automatically fund, using
a funding source provided by the first end user, a first reserved ticket purchase transaction relating to a purchase of a first reserved ticket of the first set of reserved tickets for the first end user;  and causing the at least one processor to
execute additional instructions for causing at least one component of the computer network to automatically fund, using a funding source provided by a first invitee, a second reserved ticket purchase transaction relating to a purchase of a second
reserved ticket of the first set of reserved tickets for the first invitee.
<br/><br/> 5.  The computer implemented method of claim 1 wherein the funding of the at least one reserved ticket purchase transaction includes: causing at least one component of the computer network to automatically fund a first reserved ticket purchase
transaction relating to a purchase of a first reserved ticket for the first end user;  and causing at least one component of the computer network to automatically fund a second reserved ticket purchase transaction relating to a purchase of a second
reserved ticket for the at least one identified invitee.
<br/><br/> 6.  The computer implemented method of claim 1 wherein the funding of the at least one reserved ticket purchase transaction includes causing at least one component of the computer network to automatically fund a plurality of ticket purchase
transactions for the first upcoming event relating to purchase of tickets for the first end user and for the at least one identified invitee.
<br/><br/> 7.  The computer implemented method of claim 1 further comprising causing the at least one processor to execute additional instructions for: causing the at least one reserved ticket associated with the ticket reservation invitation transaction
to automatically expire in response to determining that a first amount of time has elapsed without detecting confirmation of the at least one identified invitee's acceptance of the at least one reserved ticket.
<br/><br/> 8.  The computer implemented method of claim 1 further comprising causing the at least one processor to execute additional instructions for: causing at least one component of the computer network to receive a first set of user input
instructions, the first set of user input instructions being generated from the end user's device in response to user interaction with the Ticketing GUI, the first set of user input instructions including a request to access ticketing information
relating to the first upcoming event;  and causing at least one component of the computer network to generate, in response to the first set of user input instructions, a third set of instructions for causing a Ticketing graphical user interface
("Ticketing GUI") to be displayed at an end user's device, wherein the third set of instructions include instructions for configuring the Ticketing GUI to enable an end user to: initiate a ticket reservation transaction relating to a reservation of a
first set of reserved tickets for the first upcoming event;  initiate a ticket purchase transaction relating to a purchase of a second set of reserved tickets for the first upcoming event;  initiate a ticket reservation invitation transaction for
inviting at least one identified invitee to accept at least one reserved ticket for the first upcoming event;  access updated ticket reservation status information relating to one or more of the end user's ticket reservations;  and access updated ticket
reservation invitation status information relating to one or more of the end user's ticket reservation invitations.
<br/><br/> 9.  The computer implemented method of claim 1 further comprising causing the at least one processor to execute additional instructions for: causing at least one component of the computer network to receive a first set of user input
instructions, the first set of user input instructions being generated from the end user's device in response to a first user's interaction with the Ticketing GUI, the first set of user input instructions including instructions to initiate a ticket
reservation transaction relating to a reservation of a first set of reserved tickets for the first upcoming event;  causing at least one component of the computer network to initiate, in response to the first set of user input instructions, a first
reserved ticket reservation transaction relating to a reservation of a first reserved ticket for the first upcoming event;  causing at least one component of the computer network to associate the reserved first reserved ticket with a first identifier
representing the first user;  causing at least one component of the computer network to initiate, in response to the first set of user input instructions, a second reserved ticket reservation transaction relating to a reservation of a second reserved
ticket for the first upcoming event;  causing at least one component of the computer network to determine, using input provided by the first user, a second identifier for identifying a specific person who is to be associated with the reserved second
reserved ticket;  and causing at least one component of the computer network to associate the reserved second reserved ticket with the second identifier.
<br/><br/> 10.  The computer implemented method of claim 1 further comprising causing the at least one processor to execute additional instructions for: causing at least one component of the computer network to automatically track ticket reservation
invitation responses from the at least one identified invitee;  and causing at least one component of the computer network to generate a third set of instructions for causing a Ticketing graphical user interface ("Ticketing GUI") to be displayed at an
end user's device, wherein the third set of instructions include instructions for configuring the Ticketing GUI to enable an end user to access updated ticket reservation status information relating to one or more of the end user's ticket reservations,
and to access updated ticket reservation invitation status information relating to one or more of the end user's ticket reservation invitations, wherein the ticket reservation invitation status information includes information identifying which ticket
reservation invitations have been accepted, which ticket reservation invitations have not yet been accepted, and/or which ticket reservation invitations have been declined.
<br/><br/> 11.  A computer implemented method for facilitating automated conditional purchasing of event tickets via a computer network, the method comprising causing at least one processor to execute a plurality of instructions for: causing at least one
component of the computer network to identify a first upcoming event which is scheduled to occur at a first venue;  causing at least one component of the computer network to generate a first set of instructions for causing a Ticketing graphical user
interface ("Ticketing GUI") to be displayed at an end user's device, wherein the first set of instructions include instructions for configuring the Ticketing GUI to enable a first end user to initiate a ticket reservation invitation transaction for

Bands/Artists; Venue/Festival related events; Online streaming radio stations; Online streaming video stations; Etc.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, the MMMS System may include functionality for enabling users to selectively filter search results and/or presented content according to a variety of different filtering criteria such as, for example, one or more of
the following (or combinations thereof): geographic location; geographic proximity; time/date criteria; venue/festival name(s); music genre(s); video genre(s); artist/band name(s) user ID; geographic location of artist/band origin (e.g., home town);
geographic location of upcoming shows and/or events; geographic proximity of upcoming shows and/or events; user "mood" (e.g., happy, sad, excited, etc.) "night out" qualities (e.g., dance party, romantic, dinner music, etc.) event ticket price event age
restrictions group/conditional ticketing availability etc.
<br/><br/> In at least some embodiments described herein, the terms "MAGNIFI" and "MAGNIFI System" may refer to one or more embodiments of the MMMS System (and/or portions thereof), such as, for example, those corresponding to the website system(s),
GUI(s), and music streaming service(s) associated with the website domain MAGNIFI.FM (www.magnifi.fm).  Thus, for example, as used herein, the terms "MMMS System", "MAGNIFI", and "MAGNIFI System" may be used interchangeably, unless otherwise noted. 
Additionally, in at least some embodiments described herein, the terms "Artist" or "Band" may be used interchangeably to refer to one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): music related artist(s)/band(s), songwriters, composers, performers,
etc.
<br/><br/> Various techniques are described herein for providing ticketing reservation and purchasing functionality for enabling and/or facilitating users in performing activities/operations relating to group ticket reservations and/or conditional ticket
purchases for various types of events which are scheduled to occur at one or more different venues.  Examples of some such events may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): music events, comedy events,
lecture events, sporting events, theater events, conferences, movie events, online events, and/or other types of events in which tickets may be required for attendance/admission/access to the event.
<br/><br/>Venue-Ticketing Example A
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, the MMMS System may be configured or designed to provide ticketing reservation and purchasing functionality for enabling and/or facilitating users in performing activities/operations relating to reservation and/or
purchasing of tickets to events such as live performances at one or more venues.  Live performances may include, but are not limited to, music events, comedy events, sporting events, theater events, conferences or other live events for which tickets may
be purchased
<br/><br/>Venue-Ticketing Example B
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, reservation and/or purchasing of tickets by MAGNIFI users may be facilitated by 3.sup.rd party system(s)/component(s).  Such facilitation may occur by way of reservation and/or ticket purchase functionality residing on
3.sup.rd party platforms via a Software Developers Kit (SDK), an iFrame embed or a hyperlink, such that reservation and/or ticket purchase can be initiated outside the MAGNIFI platform.  Such facilitation may also include the ability to publicly post on
3rd party internet websites such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b> and Twitter the user's interaction with a ticket reservation (such as reservation creation, reservation acceptance, and/or reservation declining) ("John just reserved 8 tickets to [EVENT] on December 12th.")
<br/><br/>Venue-Ticketing Example C
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, at some point after the Initial Ticket On-Sale event (e.g., approximately 1-5 days after), the venue hosting the event (e.g., concert/show) would set the Reservation Allotment for how many reservations it would
guarantee/allot for a specific concert.  In one embodiment, to determine the Reservation Allotment, the venue may take their "Sellable Capacity" less "Anticipated Sales", and the remaining number may be the Anticipated Unsold Tickets ("AUTs").  "Sellable
Capacity" may be determined by the ticket allotment for an event as comprised from multiple sources, including but not limited to: ticket allotment directly from the Ticketing Company, ticket allotment from the Venue, ticket allotments from 3rd party
resellers, and ticket allotment from the artist/performer/team.  A separate Event Ticket Reservation Pool would exist, comprised of the Reservation Allotment less all pending ticket reservations across all Reservation Groups for the Event.  An API would
connect the Event Ticket Allotment Pool and the Event Ticket Reservation Pool, such that event tickets may be deemed "claimed inventory" (and fulfilled as such using a variety of delivery methods) for all Reservation Slots within Reservation Groups that
had achieved the Minimum Subscriber Level.  Tickets for Reservation Groups that had not achieved the Minimum Subscriber Level may be deemed "reclaimed inventory" and would either return to the Event Ticket Allotment Pool or remain in Event Ticket
Allotment Pool until claimed, depending on the embodiment.  The Host may be allowed to invite up to a predetermined "super percentage" (e.g., 1.5.times., 2.times., 3.times., etc.) of the number of tickets reserved by the Host, to account for the
likelihood that not all Invitees would accept the Reservation Group Invitation.
<br/><br/>Example Ticketing-Customer Interaction A
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, once the Reservation Allotment is available in the TRPS, MAGNIFI users may be able to view an Event Page for a particular event.  On the Event Page, the user may be able to view (e.g., in real-time) information
relating to the total number of tickets sold for that event and the number of reservations available.
<br/><br/> Other information accessible from the Event Page may include: date of upcoming event start time of upcoming event start time of each performer/performance within the event venue name and address venue location on a map display
artist/performer/team name and description event age restrictions ticket price group/conditional ticketing availability reviews of the venue reviews of the artist/performer/team Invitees to the Reservation Group required time frame for accepting or
declining the Group Ticketing Invitation, Invitees may also play audio and/or visual media by event artists/performers.
<br/><br/>Example Ticketing-Customer Interaction B
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, MAGNIFI users may be able to "buy now" for immediate ticket purchase and/or be able to make ticket reservations (e.g., for one or more persons).  Users interacting with MAGNIFI ticketing features can choose to
purchase outright one or more tickets to an upcoming event, or they can initiate Group Ticketing by creating a Reservation Group across multiple Invitees for one or more ticket reservations to an upcoming event.
<br/><br/>Ticketing Reservation Example A
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, when making the Ticketing Reservation, the Reservation Host may be able to designate other MAGNIFI users (Reservation Recipients) to receive an "invitation to accept the Reservation." Once the Host indicates the
number of tickets they would like to reserve for the upcoming event, the Host may be prompted to indicate specific individuals the Host wished to invite to join the Reservation Group.  These individuals are "Initial Invitees".  In one embodiment, the
Reservation Group may be configured such that Initial Invitees may be permitted to themselves invite "Additional Invitees" to the Reservation Group.
<br/><br/>Ticketing Reservation Example B
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, one or more "Invitation to Accept Ticket Reservation" messages may be sent within MAGNIFI to Reservation Recipients.  This message may also automatically publicly post on 3rd party internet websites such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b>
and Twitter the user's interaction with a ticket reservation (such as reservation creation, reservation acceptance, and/or reservation declining) ("John just reserved 8 tickets to [EVENT] on December 12th.") This message may also be automatically sent
via email, SMS or other digital communication means, such that the Host would enter the phone number or email addresses of the Initial Invitees.  In one embodiment on a mobile device, the Host may be prompted to allow MAGNIFI to access the Host's mobile
device saved contacts in order to facilitate the entering of the Initial Invitees' contact information for purposes of sending the Reservation Group Invitation.
<br/><br/>Making the Reservation Example A
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, the Host and the Recipients may be provided with a window of time in which to convert their Reservations into Ticket purchases.  The reservation time window may be determined by the Venue, the Ticketing Company,
MAGNIFI or another party involved in the Event, and may be based on the number of days prior to the Event the time frame window should close, some percentage of total Event Tickets sold, achievement of reservation acceptance benchmarks in the form of a
Minimum Subscriber Level, or some other determination.  The Minimum Subscriber Level for a Reservation Group may be the minimum number of Invitees required to accept the Group Ticketing Invitation such that an automated process of ticket purchases for
all Subscribed Invitees is triggered.  The Minimum Subscriber Level may be determined by the Host, the Venue, the Ticketing Company, MAGNIFI or another party involved in the Event, depending on the embodiment.  If the Reservation Group does not achieve
the Minimum Subscriber Level within a predetermined time frame (egg, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours), the Reservation Group is cancelled, the reservations expire, and the Event Tickets become "reclaimed inventory" into the Event Ticket Allotment Pool as
described below.  Invitees are informed of the expiration, and given easy access to a link to re-instigate another reservation, when available.  If the Reservation Group does attain the Minimum Subscriber Level, the credit card (or other payment method)
of each Subscribed Invitee may be automatically charged for only the number of tickets they had claimed as Reservation Slots, such that no one Reservation Group member may bear the entire cost of all tickets for the Reservation Group, unless the
Reservation Group ticket purchases were intentionally configured in this way.  Subscribed Invitees who have accepted the Group Ticketing Invitation after the Minimum Subscriber Level is achieved may be automatically and immediately charged for the number
of tickets associated with their Reservation Slots.
<br/><br/>Making the Reservation Example B
<br/><br/> Once the Host has received confirmation from Recipients of their intent to attend the Event as a group (e.g., via MAGNIFI SMS, text message, email, social media posting, phone call, in person, etc.), the Reservation Host may automatically handle
the Ticket purchases on behalf of the Reservation Group, or TRPS may automatically handle the Ticket purchases on behalf of the Reservation Group, depending on the embodiment.  Such automated ticket purchases may be achieved by Reservation Invitees (and
the Reservation Host) entering their credit card information or other payment information at the point of Reservation acceptance, indicating the number of Reservation Slots they would like to convert to Event Tickets, indicating whether MAGNIFI should
store their payment information for future ticket purchases or reservations, and permitting their respective credit cards or other payment methods to be charged (once the Reservation Group achieved the Minimum Subscriber Level) in order to convert their
Reservation into an Event Ticket.  Confirmation of Reservation acceptance by Invitees may be automatically sent via email, SMS or other digital communication means, and/or automatically posted to 3rd party internet websites such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b> and Twitter.
<br/><br/>Example Reservation Definitions
<br/><br/> an opportunity for an individual to defer an event ticket purchase to a later time, while retaining the ability to convert such opportunity to an event ticket purchase at some point prior to the ticketed event an opportunity for an individual to
facilitate a group of people in purchasing multiple tickets to an event, such purchase being potentially conditional upon group confirmation of intent to attend the event an opportunity for an individual to receive something of value for either
converting their deferred purchase to an actual purchase, or for successfully facilitating event ticket purchases
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, one person may function (or may be assigned) as the primary (or lead) ticket reservation facilitator (e.g., "Host), facilitating the purchase of tickets by others.  In some embodiments, multiple different persons may
each be designated as a Hosts (or Co-Host).
<br/><br/> In at least some embodiments, the different members of the group reservation may each purchase their own ticket separately, or may split the cost of the group ticket reservation/purchase transaction(s).  In other embodiments, a single person
(such as, for example, the Host(s)) may pay the entire cost of the group ticket reservation/purchase transaction(s) (e.g., one person pays for all purchase tickets), and the MAGNIFI system may be configured or designed to include functionality for
assisting the purchaser in collecting reimbursement from members of the group.
<br/><br/> Group Ticketing &amp; Reservation Functionality:
<br/><br/> The MAGNIFI event discovery platform (web, mobile web and mobile application) allows users to access ticketing information for upcoming events, initiate ticket purchases for individuals and create Ticket Reservations for groups of individuals.
<br/><br/> The various ticketing and reservation techniques disclosed herein may provide functionality for facilitating, enabling, initiating, and/or performing automated, conditional event ticketing and reservation transactions (e.g., including
invitations, tracking, fulfillment, refunds, etc.) via a computer network.
<br/><br/> The MAGNIFI platform provides users with ticketing access and purchase/reservation initiation actions from multiple areas of the platform, including but not limited to one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): Location-based event
listings (e.g., a scrollable list of multiple events in a specific location or region).  Artist/performer/team-based event listings (e.g., a scrollable list of multiple events across multiple locations or regions relating to a single
artist/performer/team).  Venue-based event listings (e.g., a scrollable list of multiple events of multiple artists/performers/teams at a single venue).  Event pages (e.g., a single page devoted to a single event).  Related event pages (e.g., a
scrollable list of events related to a single event or multiple events reflecting an aggregation of events recommended to a user based on their usage history and/or preferences).  Music player GUIs (e.g., a GUI launched when a user initiates a streaming
playlist of music pulled from any of the above relating to music performances).  Search engine results.  Travel reservation services.  Dining reservation services.  Music sites and apps.  Etc.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, MAGNIFI Group Reservation functionality may be incorporated (or embedded) into in <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Google, Open Table, etc. (e.g., everywhere online that event attendance and/or ticketing decisions are made, not just the MAGNIFI
platform).  This concept describes group ticket/event reservations and "cost-splitting" made easy.  For example, in some embodiments, one or more ticketing reservation/purchasing aspects/features described herein may be viewed within the MAGNIFI platform
or outside the platform, such as, for example, in an email sent to a MAGNIFI user.
<br/><br/> Users interacting with MAGNIFI ticketing features may choose to purchase outright one or more tickets to an upcoming event, or they may initiate Group Ticketing by creating a Reservation Group across multiple Invitees for one or more ticket
reservations to an upcoming event.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the user initiating Group Ticketing via a Reservation Group may be referred to as the "Host".  Upon initiating Group Ticketing for an upcoming event, the Host may be prompted to indicate the number of tickets they may like
to reserve for the upcoming event.
<br/><br/> The number of tickets the Host may be allowed to reserve may be determined by multiple factors, including but not limited to the Event Ticket Inventory Pool and the Event Ticket Reservation Pool as described below.
<br/><br/> Once the Host indicates the number of tickets they may like to reserve for the upcoming event, the Host may be prompted to determine how many of the reserved tickets should be allocated for the Host themselves.  In one embodiment, the minimum
number of reserved tickets allocable to the Host is "1" and the maximum number is "Reserved Tickets minus 1".
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the Host may also be prompted to determine if they wish to purchase their own reserved ticket(s), prior to or immediately after inviting Invitees and/or regardless of Invitee reservation acceptance status.
<br/><br/> The Host may be prompted to indicate specific individuals the Host wishes to invite to join the Reservation Group.  These individuals are "Initial Invitees".
<br/><br/> The Host may then enter the phone number or email addresses of the Initial Invitees.  In one embodiment on a mobile device or computer, the Host may be prompted to allow MAGNIFI to access the Host's mobile device/computer saved contacts in order
to facilitate the entering of the Initial Invitees' contact information for purposes of sending the Reservation Group Invitation.  In one embodiment, if the Host enters an email address, phone number or other contact method which is not associated in the
Host's mobile device or computer with a contact name, the Host may be prompted to associate a contact name with the email address or phone number and save this information in the MAGNIFI ticketing platform for future reference.
<br/><br/> The Host may be allowed to invite up to a predetermined "super percentage" (e.g., 1.5.times., 2.times., 3.times., etc.) of the number of tickets reserved, to account for the likelihood that some or all Invitees may not accept the Reservation
Group Invitation.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the Host may be able to set Reservation Parameters for the Reservation Group, such as, for example, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): The number of tickets to be reserved for the Host; Whether the Host
wishes to "gift" (e.g., pay for) a ticket for one or more Invitees; The number of tickets available to be reserved by each Initial Invitee; Whether each Initial Invitee may add additional invitees ("Additional Invitees"; "Initial Invitees" plus
"Additional Invitees"="Invitees") to the Reservation Group; The number of Additional Invitees available to be added by each Initial Invitee to the Reservation Group; Whether the reservation is publicly visible (e.g., Publish on FB, Twitter, alerts,
elsewhere: "So and so just reserved 8 tickets to see Thee Oh Sees on December 12.") The maximum number of individuals (Host+Total Invitees) permitted in the group.  Whether the Host approves the Reservation Group size to be automatically increased if
Invitees wish to invite Additional Invitees; Whether the Host approves the number of Reservation Slots to be automatically increased if Invitees wish to claim more Reservation Slots than are available in the Reservation Group as created by the Host;
Whether Invitees can view a list of all Invitees in the Reservation Group; Whether Invitees can communicate with other Invitees in the Reservation Group within the platform; Saving the Reservation Group, including the list of Invitees and the parameters
set, and naming the Reservation Group, so that the Reservation Group may be easily accessed for creating future Reservation Groups to other events; Etc.
<br/><br/> In at least some embodiments, once the Host indicates the total number of ticket reservations available in the Reservation Group, determines the Initial Invitees to the Reservation Group, and sets parameters for the Reservation Group, a Group
Ticketing Event Page may be created within the platform, and Group Ticketing Invitations may be sent to the Initial Invitees via email, SMS, MAGNIFI notification or other means--directing the Initial Invitees to access the Group Ticketing Event Page
within the MAGNIFI platform.
<br/><br/> In alternate embodiments, the initial message received by an Invitee may read something like one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): "Howie just reserved 5 tickets to Cool Ghouls at the Fillmore on Nov.  23, 2015.  Are you in?"
(with a link to the Group Ticketing Event Page) "Howie just reserved 5 tickets for himself and 4 others to Cool Ghouls at the Fillmore on Nov.  23, 2015.  Are you in?" (with a link to the Group Ticketing Event Page) "Howie just reserved 5 tickets for the
San Francisco Giants game on Nov.  23, 2015 for himself, Toby, you and possibly 2 others.  Wanna go?" (with a link to the Group Ticketing Event Page) (mobile SMS) "Howie just reserved 5 tickets to see "The Hobbit" at Grand Lake Movie Theater tomorrow
night (Nov.  23, 2015).  Are you in? Text "yes", "no" or "maybe" (Group Ticketing Event Page is automatically updated with the Invitee's response)
<br/><br/> Per the Reservation Parameters, if any Initial Invitees invite Additional Invitees to join the Reservation Group, Additional Invitees may receive a Group Ticketing Invitation and access to the Group Ticketing Event Page for the Reservation
Group.  Initial Invitees and Additional Invitees may also receive an update as to the status of the reservation's invitee group.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the Host and the Invitees may be required to have or create MAGNIFI user profiles in order to create a Reservation Group and/or access the Group Ticketing Event Page.
<br/><br/> Upon accessing the Group Ticketing Event Page, at least one Invitee may see information regarding the upcoming event and the Reservation Group, including but not limited to one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): The name of the
Reservation Group (if any); Date of upcoming event; Start time of upcoming event; Start time of at least one performer within the event; Venue name and address; Venue location on a map display; Artist/performer/team name and description; Reviews of the
venue; Reviews of the artist/performer/team; Host of the Reservation Group; Invitees to the Reservation Group; Required time frame for accepting or declining the Group Ticketing Invitation; Reservation Parameters set by the Host; Attendance Status of
each member of the Reservation Group (yes/no/maybe/no response); Display of a thread of comments (text or other media) posted by Invitees; Audio/visual media associated with event artists/performers/team; Number of remaining Reservation Slots for
Reservation Group; Number of total remaining Reservations available for event; Etc.
<br/><br/> Invitees may have the option of accepting or declining the Group Ticketing Invitation and writing a comment(s) about their choice.  This comment may be disseminated to the Reservation Group via email, SMS, MAGNIFI mobile app notification or
other digital communication means and may also reside within the Group Ticketing Event Page as a comment thread.  Each Invitee may also set their notification preferences for updates on the Reservation Group.
<br/><br/> Invitees may also have the option of claiming 1 or more Reservation Slots, as determined by the parameters set by the Host, MAGNIFI, the Venue, the Ticketing Company, the Artist/Performer/Team or another party involved in the Event.  At least
one "Reservation Slot" may be the equivalent of 1 Event Ticket if the reservations are converted to tickets as described below.
<br/><br/> If an Invitee accepts the Group Ticketing Invitation, they may be prompted to facilitate, enable, initiate, and/or perform one or more of the following operation(s), action(s), and/or feature(s) (or combinations thereof): Sign up for MAGNIFI, or
login if they have already joined in the past; Enter their credit card information; Indicate the number of Reservation Slots they wish to claim; Query the Reservation Host and/or the TRPS regarding additional Reservation Slots, if the Invitee wishes to
claim more Reservation Slots than are currently available in the Reservation Group, Indicate whether MAGNIFI may store their credit card information for future ticket purchases or reservations; Permit their credit card to be charged (once the Reservation
Group achieved the Minimum Subscriber Level) in order to convert their Reservation Slot(s) to Event Tickets; Permit their credit card to be charged only if some other specific Invitee(s) accept the Reservation Invitation ("I'll go if Wayne is going");
"Gift" a ticket to another Invitee (e.g., pay for another's ticket); Calendar the event; Share their Group Ticketing Invitation acceptance on social media sites, alerting others of the upcoming event and the Invitees intent to attend; Enter notification
preferences and other settings, such as: Alerts for comments (on/off) Alerts for RSVPs (on/off) Alerts for event reminders (on/off) Alerts for special event deals/experiences offered by the Venue, Artist/Performer/Team, nearby vendors such as restaurants
and bars (on/off) Mute this Reservation (on/off) Follow Artist/Performer/Team on MAGNIFI (on/off) Follow Venue on MAGNIFI (on/off) Follow all other Invitees in the Reservation on MAGNIFI (on/off) Etc.
<br/><br/> The Host may also be prompted to complete these steps upon sending out the Invitation to the Initial Invitees.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, if an Invitee declines the Reservation Invitation or the Reservation Group fills up before they accept or decline, or the Reservation Group fills up after they respond "maybe going"--such Invitee may receive notification
prompts to create their own Reservation Group for the same Event or another Event.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a Minimum Subscriber Level for a Reservation Group may be set according to the minimum number of Invitees required to accept the Group Ticketing Invitation such that an automated process of ticket purchases for some or all
Subscribed Invitees is triggered.  In one embodiment, the Minimum Subscriber Level may be one subscriber, such that as soon as one Invitee accepts the Group Ticketing Invitation and claims Reservation Slot(s)--event tickets for the Host and the Invitee
are automatically purchased using the payment information already provided by each.  In this instance, the Reservation Group would remain open, and as soon as other Invitees accept--they too are automatically charged for the number of event tickets they
claimed as Reservation Slots.
<br/><br/> In at least some embodiments, "Subscribed Invitees" may refer to Invitees who accept the Group Ticketing Invitation.
<br/><br/> According to different embodiments, the Minimum Subscriber Level may be determined by the Host, the Venue, the Ticketing Company, MAGNIFI or another party involved in the Event, depending on the embodiment.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, if the Reservation Group does not achieve the Minimum Subscriber Level within a predetermined time frame (egg, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours), the Reservation Group is cancelled, the reservations expire, and the Event
Tickets become "reclaimed inventory" into the Event Ticket Inventory Pool as described below.  Invitees are informed of the expiration, and given easy access to a link to re-instigate another reservation, when available.
<br/><br/> According to different embodiments, the reservation time window may be determined by the Venue, the Ticketing Company, MAGNIFI and/or another party involved in the Event, and may be based on the number of days prior to the Event the time frame
window may close, or some percentage of total Event Tickets sold, or some other determination.
<br/><br/> If the Reservation Group does attain the Minimum Subscriber Level, the credit card of at least one Subscribed Invitee may be automatically charged for only the number of tickets they had claimed as Reservation Slots, such that no one Reservation
Group member may be required to bear the entire cost of some or all tickets for the Reservation Group, unless the Reservation Group ticket purchases are specifically configured in this way.
<br/><br/> Subscribed Invitees who have accepted the Group Ticketing Invitation after the Minimum Subscriber Level is achieved may be automatically and immediately charged for the number of tickets associated with their Reservation Slots.
<br/><br/> At this point, in some embodiments, Subscribed Invitees become Group Attendees.
<br/><br/> Invitees may receive regular updates regarding the time frame of the Group Ticketing Invitation (e.g., 24 hours remaining to accept, etc.).
<br/><br/> On the day of the Event, Group Attendees may be prompted to "check in" at the Event using the MAGNIFI platform, using Near Field Technology or similar geo-locating technology, indicating their physical presence at the venue/event.
<br/><br/> Before, during and after the event, Group Attendees may be prompted to post photos, videos, comments, and/or other media regarding their pre-Event and Event experience.
<br/><br/> After the Event, Group Attendees may be prompted to rate and review their experience of the Performing Artist(s), and the venue itself.  Attendees may also be prompted to make a new Reservation Group.
<br/><br/> Backend Technology Description:
<br/><br/> According to different embodiments, the ticket inventory for an event may be accepted from multiple sources, including but not limited to: ticket allotment directly from the Ticketing Company, ticket allotment from the Venue/Festival, ticket
allotments from 3rd party resellers, ticket allotment from MAGNIFI and ticket allotment from the artist/performer/team.
<br/><br/> This combined ticket inventory may comprise the Event Ticket Inventory Pool and may represent (on an ongoing, real time basis) the number of tickets available for purchase via Reservation Groups.
<br/><br/> Ticket allotment may be determined from the ticketing sources by taking their "Sellable Capacity" less "Anticipated Sales", and the remaining tickets may be the Anticipated Unsold Tickets.  The ticket source may determine to multiply the
Anticipated Unsold Tickets by a "super percent" multiplier (egg 100+%), thus creating a reservation allotment for the event.
<br/><br/> A separate Event Ticket Reservation Pool may exist, comprised of some or all pending ticket reservations across some or all Reservation Groups for the Event.
<br/><br/> An API may connect the Event Ticket Inventory Pool and the Event Ticket Reservation Pool, such that event tickets may be deemed "claimed inventory" (and fulfilled as such using a variety of delivery methods) for some or all Reservation Slots
within Reservation Groups that had achieved the Minimum Subscriber Level.  Tickets for Reservation Groups that had not achieved the Minimum Subscriber Level may be deemed "reclaimed inventory" and may either return to the Event Ticket Inventory Pool or
remain in Event Ticket Inventory Pool until claimed, depending on the embodiment.
<br/><br/> In an alternate embodiment, MAGNIFI Group Ticketing also resides inside 3.sup.rd party platforms via a Software Developers Kit (SDK), such that Reservation Groups for Events may be initiated outside the MAGNIFI platform.
<br/><br/> Venue/Ticket Promoter/Ticket Company/Artist Dashboard Description:
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, the entity offering tickets to an Event (e.g., Venue, Promoter, Ticket Company, Artist or some other person/entity) is provided access to a Dashboard GUI (herein "Dashboard") from which they can offer the tickets for
sale, offer Group Ticketing functionality, set ticket and reservation transaction parameters and monitor data regarding ticketing and reservations for one or more Events.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, such Dashboard may provide for varying permission levels of persons with access to the Dashboard, such as "Dashboard administrator" and "Dashboard user".
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the Dashboard may provide access to event ticketing/reservation data associated with multiple venues under common ownership/administration.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the Dashboard contains "profile information" on the Venue, such as: Venue name Venue address and contact information Venue website and other online properties Venue followers on MAGNIFI Venue details (parent company, capacity,
date established, etc.) Venue photos
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the Dashboard contains information regarding Ticket Reservations for each Event at the Venue, such as: Tickets currently allocated Tickets currently sold Tickets currently available Reservations currently confirmed Number of
Tickets associated with confirmed Reservations Outstanding Reservations Number of Tickets associated with outstanding Reservations Monetary value of Tickets and confirmed Reservations An option to pause new Reservations An option to recall Tickets
available for Reservations An option to resume making Tickets available for Reservations An option to increase the number of Tickets allocated for Reservations
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, the Dashboard may provide access to information regarding fan email addresses collected and an exportable file of the email addresses.  In one embodiment, the Dashboard may provide access to information regarding Venue account
users, including the user names, permission levels and contact information for each.
<br/><br/> Ticket Fulfillment Description:
<br/><br/> Once ticket reservations in a Reservation Group have been converted to tickets for Group Attendees, the tickets may be delivered to at least one Group Attendee digitally or available for pickup at the Venue under the name of at least one Group
Attendee.
<br/><br/> Group Ticketing Incentives:
<br/><br/> MAGNIFI, Artists/Performers/Teams, Venues and/or Ticketing Companies participating in Group Ticketing may offer incentives/discounts/rewards for Reservation Groups that become Group Attendees.  Such incentives may be offered to the Host or
Invitees or both.  Such incentives may take the form of one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): Bulk Ticket Discount: discount prices for purchasing tickets in bulk (5 tickets for the price of 4, with the discount spread across the price
of one or more tickets, thus benefiting the Reservation Group, or applied to the tickets of specific group members (thus benefiting individuals within the Reservation Group).  Promotional Offers: venue tickets, drink tickets, drink discounts, venue swag,
VIP privileges, custom artist/performer/team merchandise, priority seating, discount coupons Vendor Affiliate Discounts: discounts at vendors/merchants affiliated with and/or proximal to the Venue, such as nearby restaurants Venue "Points": redeemable by
the Host and/or Invitees at the Venue at some later date for any of the above Group Ticketing Monetization:
<br/><br/> According to different embodiments, Group Ticketing monetization may be implemented via one or more of the following forms: Per ticket fee Per order fee Per event fee Platform subscription fee Third party sponsorship fee Third party advertiser
fee Etc. Group Ticketing Sponsor Involvement:
<br/><br/> Brand sponsor involvement may be implemented via one or more of the following forms: Local/national sponsor underwrites one or more fees and is perceived as paying one or more convenience fees related to tickets purchased through Reservation
Groups, in exchange for brand goodwill and/or user data provided by MAGNIFI; Local/national sponsor pays a flat fee per show to buy a relationship with a specific demographic and receives demographic specific user data from MAGNIFI; Local/national
sponsor pays a flat fee per show and offers product giveaways and/or raffle entries for a contest; Etc.
<br/><br/>Example "Reservation" Definitions
<br/><br/> A socially broadcast interest in attending a particular event (e.g., a "like" for an event that others may see), and then helping that general interest culminate in a tipping point where everyone wants to convert their Reservations into Tickets
to be guaranteed admission.  An option to purchase an Event Ticket.  An option to defer purchase of an Event Ticket to a later time, while retaining the ability to convert such opportunity to an Event Ticket purchase at some time prior to the ticketed
Event.  An opportunity for an individual to facilitate a group of people in purchasing multiple Event Tickets, such purchase being potentially conditioned upon group confirmation of intent to attend the Event.  An opportunity for an individual to receive
something of value for converting their deferred Event Ticket purchase to an actual Event Ticket purchase.  An opportunity for an individual to receive something of value for successfully facilitating multiple Event Ticket purchases.  A discrete unit of
the allocation of Anticipated Unsold Tickets multiplied by a super-percentage.  Ticket Reservation/Purchasing System Interaction(s)
<br/><br/> FIG. 16 shows a specific example embodiment of an interaction diagram 1600 between various systems/devices, which may be utilized for implementing various ticket reservation/purchasing aspects described herein.  In at least one embodiment, the
interaction diagram of FIG. 16 illustrates one example embodiment of how a user/client/purchaser may utilize the hardware/software components disclosed herein to initiate and/or perform a variety of different types of operations and/or activities such as
those described herein.
<br/><br/> As shown at 02--User A initiates request to TRPS for ticketing information relating to identified event.
<br/><br/> As shown at 04--TRPS 1610 accesses ticketing information from one or more local and/or remote database(s).
<br/><br/> As shown at 06--Ticketing information relating to identified event provided to User A. In at least one embodiment, when the Ticketing Information Relating to Identified Event is sent to User A, such Ticketing Information may include Ticketing
Reservation parameters as defined by one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): Web Interface/GUI providing ticket reservation/purchasing functionality (e.g., MAGNIFI GUI), TRPS, the event venue, the ticket seller, the performer and/or
another person/entity involved in the event ("Reservation Parameter Constituents"), etc. Such parameters may include limitations on the number of Reservation Invitees per Group Reservation.
<br/><br/> As shown at 08--User A initiates Ticket Reservation Request for identified event.
<br/><br/> As shown at 10--TRPS processes Ticket Reservation Request; Initiates additional procedures for acquiring from user additional information relating to Ticket Reservation Request.  Examples of Additional Procedure(s) may include, but are not
limited to, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): Determining Identity of User.  Acquiring/Validating User Payment/Funding Information (e.g., credit card info which may be used for funding ticket reservation(s) and/or ticket
purchase(s)) Identifying User's Social Network (1608) friends and/or user's "contacts list(s) (e.g., for sending ticket reservation invitations).  Facilitating user in sending one or more ticket reservation invitations to one or more selected
friends/users.  Tracking responses to ticket reservation invitations.  Facilitating user in setting up one or more rules for automated ticket purchasing and/or ticket reservation invitations.  Assigning reserved tickets to specific friends/users (e.g.,
according to user's instructions).  Etc.
<br/><br/> As shown at 12--User A provides Payment/Funding information (e.g., which may be used for funding ticket reservation(s) and/or ticket purchase(s)).
<br/><br/> As shown at 14--User A initiates request for sending Event Ticket Reservation Invitation(s) to one or more recipients.  In the present example, it is assumed that User B and User C are identified recipients.
<br/><br/> In an alternate embodiment, Steps 8, 10, 12 and/or 14 may be combined, such that User A may facilitate, enable, initiate, and/or perform one or more of the following operation(s), action(s), and/or feature(s) (or combinations thereof) via the
same GUI: Initiate Ticket Reservation Request for identified event provided to TRPS.  Request additional information relating to Reservation Request provided to TRPS.  Provide Payment/Funding Information provided to TRPS.  Initiate request for sending
Reservation Invitations to one or more recipients.  Etc.
<br/><br/> As shown at 16--TRPS processes Event Ticket Reservation Invitation Request; Identifies invitation recipients.  In this example, it is assumed (for purposes of illustration) that identified recipients include User B and User C.
<br/><br/> As shown at 18a--Event Ticket Reservation Invitation B sent to User B.
<br/><br/> As shown at 18b--Event Ticket Reservation Invitation C sent to User C.
<br/><br/> As shown at 20--TRPS automatically and periodically monitors response(s) from Event Ticket Reservation Invitation recipient(s).
<br/><br/> As shown at 22--In this example, it is assumed that User B initiates sending of additional Event Ticket Reservation Invitations to additional people.  In at least one embodiment, additional Event Ticket Reservation Invitations may be
automatically generated by TRPS 1610 and sent out to identified recipients.  In at least one embodiment, if permitted by Reservation Rules (e.g., established/defined by User A and/or Reservation Parameter Constituents) and/or default reservation rules
(e.g., defined by TRPS), User B may initiate sending of Additional Event Ticket Reservation Invitations to additional people.  In some embodiments, such additional Event Ticket Reservation Invitations may be prevented from being sent out until after
first tier of invited recipients have had a chance to accept or decline their invitation(s).
<br/><br/> As shown at 24--Assume that User B accepts Event Ticket Reservation Invitation B.
<br/><br/> As shown at 26--TRPS detects User B's acceptance of Event Ticket Reservation Invitation B, and in response, automatically initiates purchase of a first reserved Event Ticket (for identified event) using User A's Funding/Payment information. 
Steps 26, 28a and 28b assume either an embodiment without a Minimum Subscriber Level or an embodiment with a Minimum Subscriber Level which level has been achieved by User B's acceptance of Event Ticket Reservation Invitation B.
<br/><br/> As shown at 28a (optional/alternate embodiment)--TRPS detects User B's acceptance of Event Ticket Reservation Invitation B, and in response, automatically initiates purchase of a second reserved Event Ticket (for identified event) using User A's
Funding/Payment information.
<br/><br/> As shown at 28b (optional/alternate embodiment)--TRPS detects User B's acceptance of Event Ticket Reservation Invitation B, and in response, automatically initiates purchase of a second reserved Event Ticket (for identified event) using User B's
Funding/Payment information.
<br/><br/> As shown at 30--Assume that User C declines Event Ticket Reservation Invitation C.
<br/><br/> As shown at 32--TRPS detects User C's declining of Event Ticket Reservation Invitation C, and in response, automatically cancels Event Ticket Reservation associated with User C.
<br/><br/> As shown at 34 (optional/alternate embodiment)--TRPS detects User C's declining of Event Ticket Reservation Invitation C, and in response, automatically generates and sends new Event Ticket Reservation Invitation to one or more next identified
recipient(s) on User-Event Invitation Wait List.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, the user (e.g., User A) may identify a first group (e.g., first tier) of preferred recipients to receive the initial Event Ticket Reservation Invitations, and may identify additional (e.g., second tier) of recipients
to receive Event Ticket Reservation Invitations upon detecting the expiration or declining of Event Ticket Reservation Invitations from any of the first tier recipients.  This second tier of recipients may be used to populate the User-Event Invitation
Wait List.
<br/><br/>Example Case Scenario Embodiments
<br/><br/>Example of Rules for Automated Ticket Purchasing Include Whether User a Will Fund
<br/><br/> Only their own ticket purchase;
<br/><br/> Ticket purchases of the entire Reservation Group; or
<br/><br/> Ticket purchases of selected members of the Reservation Group
<br/><br/> In at least some embodiments, at least a portion of these rules may be also be set by Reservation Group Invitees for existing Reservation Group Members or Additional Invitees.  In some embodiments, at least a portion of these rules may also be
set by the Reservation Host, TRPS or Reservation Parameter Constituents.  Example Use Case A: User A creates Reservation Group of 3--enters User A credit card info--invites User B and User C--User A indicates they will pay for their own ticket once the
group is fully subscribed, but no other tickets User B accepts the invitation--enters User B credit card info--indicates they will pay for their own ticket+User C's ticket User C accepts the invitation Reservation Group is fully subscribed User A charged
for 1 ticket User B charged for 2 tickets Example Use Case B: User A creates Reservation Group of 3--enters User A credit card info--invites User B and User C--User A indicates they will pay for all group tickets (e.g., 3 tickets) once the group is fully
subscribed User B and User C accept Reservation Group is fully subscribed--User A is charged for all 3 tickets Example Use Case C: User A creates Reservation Group of 6--enters User A credit card info--invites User B and User C--User A indicates they
will pay for their own ticket once the group is fully subscribed, but no other tickets User B accepts the invitation--enters User B credit card info--invites User B-2 to join the group--User B indicates they will pay for their own ticket but no one
else's User C accepts the invitation--enters User C credit card info--invites User C-2 and User C-3--indicates they will pay for their own ticket and User C-2's ticket but not User C-3's ticket Users B, B-2, C, C-2 and C-3 all accept User A's
invitation-- group is fully subscribed--6 tickets purchased as follows: User A=1 ticket (credit card charged) User B=1 ticket (credit card charged) User B-2=1 ticket (credit card charged) User C=2 tickets (credit card charged) User C-3=1 ticket (credit
card charged)
<br/><br/>Examples of Rules for Ticket Reservation Invitations Include Whether or not
<br/><br/> A. Reservation Group Invitees may add additional invitees to the Reservation Group Example A1: NO--Additional Invitees Not Allowed User A creates Reservation Group sets Minimum Subscriber Level=2 (including User A) sets Maximum Invitees=2
Invitees can invite additional invitees?=NO User A invites User B and User C User B and User C may not invite Additional Invitees User B accepts; User C declines Reservation becomes fully subscribed because User A+User B=Minimum Subscriber Level (2

Size=6 Invitees can invite additional invitees?=YES User A invites User B and User C User B and User C may invite Additional Invitees User B accepts invitation User B invites User B-2 User C declines invitation User B-2 accepts invitation
Reservation=fully subscribed @ 3 subscribers (User A, User B, User B-2) Ticket purchases funded for User A, User B, User B-2 (SEE ABOVE RULES FOR TICKET PURCHASES) B. Reservation Group Invitees may create a new, separate Reservation Group to which to
extend additional invitees Example B1: User A creates Reservation Group User A invites User B, C, D, E, F User B declines User A invitation because: User B's family is visiting and User A's group is too small.  User B wants to start their own reservation
group User B creates "cloned" Reservation Group for same event--User B is now the Host and invites family members accordingly C. Reservation Group Invitees may create a Reservation Subgroup to which to extend additional invitees Example C1: User A
creates Reservation Group User A invites Users B, C, D User B accepts User A invitation--but User B creates their own Reservation Subgroup with its own ticket purchase &amp; invitation parameters If User A's Reservation Group is fully subscribed--User B will
be charged for that ticket; but they will still be a Sub-host of their own Sub-group--overseeing invitation &amp; purchase parameters for their Sub-group.  D. The number of additional reservation group/subgroup invitees which may be added by Reservation
Group Invitees after the Initial Invitees have been invited Example D1: User A creates Reservation Group User A sets the Maximum Group Size to 8 User A sets the Maximum Invitees to 16 User A sets the Minimum Subscriber Level to 4 User A allows Additional
Invitees User A invites Users B &amp; C (Available Invites now=14) User B accepts &amp; invites B-2, B-3, B-4, B-5 (Available Invites now=10, Subscribers now=2: User A and User B) User B-3 invites B-3a, B-3b, B-3c (Available Invites now=7) User C accepts &amp;
attempts to invite C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8 User C prevented from inviting because they've exceeded the Maximum Invitees User C prompted to remove up to 1 invitee User C accepts &amp; invites C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7 (Available Invites
now=0, Subscribers now=3: User A, User B, User C) Reservation Group now has Maximum Invitees of 16 User B-3 accepts invitation (Minimum Subscriber Level achieved.fwdarw.User A, B, C and B-3 are charged for tickets) (Group Size=4) User B-3b accepts
invitation.fwdarw.automatically charged for ticket (Group Size=5) User C-1, C-3, C-4 accept invitation.fwdarw.automatically charged for tickets (Maximum Group Size=8 achieved) User A gets notified.fwdarw.Reservation Group has hit Maximum Size, close
Reservation Group or increase group size? User A closes Reservation Group notifications go out to all remaining Invitees--group is closed--would you like to create your own Reservation Group? E. The process/flow by which the Host creates a "tiered wait
list" Example E1: User A creates Reservation Group User A identifies Users B &amp; C as being 1st Tier Invitees User A identifies User D as being a 2nd Tier Invitee User A identifies Users E &amp; F as being 3rd Tier Invitees User B and C both decline the
invite.fwdarw.2 spots available Embodiment E1: 2 open spots are made available on first come-first served basis to all remaining Invitees, regardless of Tier Embodiment E1(a): 2 open spots are both offered to 2nd Tier Invitee User D, allowing User D to
invite Additional Invitees--potentially creating their own tiered invitation list.  If User D declines--2 open spots go to Tier 3 Invitees on first come-first served basis Embodiment E1(b): 2 open spots go to Tier 3 Invitees in ranked order (egg, spots
offered to User E first and if declined, offered to User F) Embodiment E1(c): 1 open spot offered to Tier 2 Invitee User D+1 open spot offered to Tier 3 Invitees on a first-come-first-served basis.  Embodiment E1(d): 1 open spot offered to Tier 2 Invitee
user D+1 open spot offered to Tier 3 Invitees in ranked order (egg, first offered to User E) F. The process/flow by which Additional Invitees are allowed into the Reservation Group, which may include a "wait list" and/or "tiered wait list" Example F1:
Wait List for Initial Invitees User A creates Reservation Group User A sets the Maximum Group Size to 6 User A invites Users B, C, D, E, F, G, H (7 invitees) Users B, C, D, E, F accept (Group Size=6) Users G &amp; H attempt to accept--but Group is already at
maximum--they are put on the "wait list" for this Group Users C and E subsequently decline--2 spots open up Users G &amp; H receive notifications that they may now join the Group Example F2: Tiered Wait List for Initial Invitees+Additional Invitees User A
creates Reservation Group User A sets Maximum Group Size to 6 User A invites Users B, C, D, E, F, G, H User B invites Users B-2 User C invites Users C-2 User C-2 invites User C-2a Users B, C, D, E, F accept (Group Size=6) Users G, H, B-2, C-2, C-2a
attempt to accept--but Group is already at maximum--they are put on the "wait list" for this Group Users C and E subsequently decline--2 spots open up Embodiment F2(a): spots are offered on first come-first served basis to Users G, H, B-2, C-2, C-2a
Embodiment F2(b): spots are first offered to Initial Invitees Users G and H. If one or both decline--remaining spot(s) go to all remaining Additional Invitees on first come-first served basis Embodiment F2(c): spots are first offered to Initial Invitees
Users G and H. If one or both decline--remaining spot(s) are second offered to 1st tier Additional Invitee B-2.  If B-2 declines--remaining spot(s) offered to 2nd Tier Additional Invitee B-2a

<br/><br/> "Shows Near" Geographic Location Stations Functionality
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, MMMS System (also referred to herein as "MAGNIFI") users may create geographic location specific (e.g., "city specific") streaming radio stations playing artists with upcoming live performances within the geographic
location (e.g., San Francisco) specified by the user.  Additionally, users may specify other filtering criteria (either separately or in different combinations) such as, for example, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): Geographic
proximity or "radius" filtering criteria (e.g. "within 15 miles of Paris" or "within 50 miles of Chicago"); Time/Date filtering criteria (e.g. "tonight," "this week," "next 2 weeks," "all dates" or "custom dates" wherein a user specifies a specific date
range such as between July 15.sup.th and August 3.sup.rd); "Genre" and/or "Tag" filtering criteria (e.g. folk, folk+rock, folk+rock but not experimental) Venue specific filtering criteria (e.g., limit search results to events at The Fillmore (San
Francisco) or The Great American Music Hall (San Francisco) or Yoshi's Jazz Club (Oakland)).  Artist/band specific filtering criteria (e.g., "The Cribs"; "STS9 or Mojomama"; etc.) In at least one embodiment, when a user enters their filter criteria for a
"Shows Near" Geographic Location search, MAGNIFI searches its database (and/or remote database(s)) and automatically and dynamically generates (e.g., in real-time) at least one streaming radio station which will play only songs from artists who match the
criteria.  For example, "Folk Rock but not Experimental Artists with upcoming live performances in the next 2 weeks within 50 miles of Chicago."
<br/><br/> Venue(s) Stations Functionality
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, MAGNIFI users may create "venue specific" streaming radio stations playing artists with upcoming live performances at one or more venues selected by the user.  Users may also set "timeframe" filter criteria (e.g.
"tonight," "this week," "next 2 weeks," "all dates" or "custom dates" wherein a user specifies a specific date range such as between July 15.sup.th and August 3.sup.rd).  Users may also set "genre" filter criteria (e.g. "folk," or "folk+rock," or
"folk+rock but not experimental").  When a user enters their filter criteria for a Venue(s) Station, MAGNIFI searches its database (and/or remote database(s)) and automatically and dynamically generates (e.g., in real-time) at least one streaming radio
station playing only songs from artists who match the specified filter criteria.  For example, using one or more MAGNIFI GUIs, a user may initiate a filtered search for "Folk Rock but not Experimental Artists with upcoming live performances at The
Fillmore, Great American Music Hall and Cafe Du Nord between July 15.sup.th and August 3.sup.rd." In response, MAGNIFI may search its database (and/or remote database(s)) and automatically and dynamically identify and display (e.g., in real-time)
information relating to artists/bands and/or upcoming live performances which match the user specified filter criteria.  Additionally, MAGNIFI may identify songs of artists/bands which match the user specified filter criteria, and dynamically generate a
streaming radio station which includes only songs from the identified artists who match the user specified filter criteria.
<br/><br/> Hometown/Neighborhood Stations Functionality
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, MAGNIFI users may create "artist hometown/neighborhood" streaming radio stations which includes only those artists whose hometown or "home-hood" matches a city or neighborhood specified by the user.  Users may also
specify geographic proximity (e.g., "radius") filter criteria (e.g. "within 15 miles of Paris" or "within 50 miles of Chicago"); and/or may also specify "genre" filter criteria (e.g. "folk," or "folk+rock," or "folk+rock but not experimental").  When a
user enters their filter criteria for a Hometown/Home-hood Station.  MAGNIFI searches its database (and/or remote database(s)) and automatically and dynamically generates (e.g., in real-time) at least one streaming radio station for playing only songs by
artists who match the criteria.  For example, "Folk Rock but not Experimental Artists from within 5 miles of Moscow" or "Indie Singer-Songwriter but not Country Artists from the Lower East Side of New York City."
<br/><br/> Artist/Show Recommendation Stations Functionality
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, MAGNIFI users may enter the name of one or more artist(s)/band(s) (herein the "Target Artist(s)") to create "recommendation" stations, where the "recommendation criteria" for the station is based primarily on live
performance and tour information, such as, for example, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): (1) other artists who have performed with the Target Artist(s) in the past; (2) other artists who are scheduled to perform with the Target
Artist(s) in the future; (3) other artists who have performed at the same venue(s) and/or festival(s) that the Target Artist(s) has performed at in the past; and/or (4) other artists who are scheduled to perform in the future at the same venue(s) and/or
festival(s) that the Target Artist(s) has performed at. Additional "recommendation criteria" may include other filter criteria such as, for example, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): other artists who have been "starred" by MAGNIFI
users who have also starred the Target Artist(s); genre and tag cross-matching filter criteria (e.g., specified by the user); play count and popularity within the MAGNIFI System; geolocation based criteria (such as prioritizing other artists in the
station based on upcoming concerts that are proximal to the listener); "similar artist" results which, for example, may be acquired from API calls to external databases (e.g. EchoNest, Last.FM); user created stations that include one or more of the
Target Artist(s); etc.
<br/><br/> Ticket Reservation Service Functionality Venue Implementation: In at least one embodiment, the MMMS System may be configured or designed to provide ticketing reservation and purchasing functionality for enabling and/or facilitating users in
performing activities/operations relating to reservation and/or purchasing of tickets to events such as live performances at one or more venues.  For example, in at least one embodiment, the MMMS System may include a Ticketing Reservation/Purchase System
("TRPS") which may be configured or designed to automatically and/or dynamically identify event ticketing reservation/purchasing opportunities in advance of tickets going on sale to the public.  In one embodiment, reservation and/or purchasing of tickets
by MAGNIFI users may be facilitated by 3.sup.rd party system(s)/component(s).  In at least one embodiment, at some point after the Initial Ticket On-Sale event (e.g., approximately 1-5 days after), the venue hosting the event (e.g., concert/show) would
set the Reservation Allotment for how many reservations it would guarantee/allot for a specific concert.  In one embodiment, to determine the Reservation Allotment, the venue may take their "Sellable Capacity" less "Anticipated Sales", and the remaining
number may be the Anticipated Unsold Tickets ("AUTs").  For example, a venue with a Sellable Capacity of 500 and Anticipated Sales of 300 may be provided with 200 AUTs remaining.  The TRPS would multiply the venue's AUT by a "super percent" multiplier
(e.g., 100+%), thus creating the Reservation Allotment for the event.  One reason for the super percentage multiplier is that not all reservations may be converted to a ticket purchase.  Customer Interaction: In at least one embodiment, once the
Reservation Allotment is available in the TRPS, MAGNIFI users may be able to view a Concert Page for a particular event.  On the Concert Page, the user may view (e.g., in real-time) information relating to the total number of tickets sold for that event
and the number of reservations available.  MAGNIFI users may be able to "buy now" for immediate ticket purchase and/or be able to make ticket reservations (e.g., for one or more persons).  In one embodiment where MAGNIFI users may "star" particular
venues, MAGNIFI users may receive an update when an event is scheduled at one of their starred venues, and by clicking on the update, they may be directed to the Concert Page for that event, where they may purchase tickets and/or make Reservations. 
Making the Reservation: In at least one embodiment, when making the Reservation, the Reservation Host may be able to designate other MAGNIFI users (Reservation Recipients) to receive an "invitation to accept the Reservation." This message may be sent
within MAGNIFI to Reservation Recipients.  The Host and the Recipients may be provided with a window of time in which to convert their Reservations into Ticket purchases.  Once the Host has received confirmation from Recipients of their intent to attend
the show as a group (e.g., via MAGNIFI SMS, text message, phone call, in person, etc.), the Reservation Host may automatically handle the Ticket purchases on behalf of the Reservation Group.  Picking up Tickets purchased through TRPS: In at least one
embodiment, the venue keeps track of tickets purchased through at least one Reservation Group in the TRPS.  The Host of at least one Reservation Group is now "hosting" a "guest list" of attendees at the event.  At least one member of the Reservation
Group arrives at the venue, informs Will Call that they're on the Reservation Host's Guest List, presents ID, and receives their Ticket.  Reservation Incentives: In at least one embodiment, venues participating in the TRPS may be able to access their
Venue Dashboard, select a particular event, and set any incentives/discounts it wants to offer for that event.  The Reservation Host would then be eligible for deals as an incentive for buying AUTs in bulk, for example.  In at least one embodiment,
MAGNIFI users who reserve or purchase their tickets via the MAGNIFI System may receive other types of promotional offers or benefits such as, for example: Bulk Ticket Discount: By way of example, 5 tickets for the price of 4, with the discount spread
across the price of one or more tickets, thus benefiting the Reservation Group.  The venue is only getting income from 4 ticket sales, but the event will be attended by 5 persons who may generate other income for the venue while attending the show. 
Promotional Offers: drink tickets, venue swag, VIP privileges, priority seat reservations, discount coupons, etc. Future Show Discounts: Discounts on Ticket purchases for future shows at that venue, or at shows among various venues in a Venue Group. 
Vendor Affiliate Discounts: Discounts at vendors/merchants in the same neighborhood as the venue.  Venue "Points": Redeemable by the Host at the venue at some later date for any of the above.  TRPS Monetization: Monetization of the TRPS may take one or
more of the following forms (or combinations thereof): Per Ticket Fee; Per Order Fee; and/or Per Show Fee.  Example Models for Sponsorship Sales: (1) local/national sponsor underwrites one or more fees and is perceived as paying one or more convenience
fees related to Tickets purchased through the TRPS for that event, in exchange for brand goodwill and/or user data provided by MAGNIFI; (2) local/national sponsor pays a flat fee per show to buy a relationship with a specific demographic and receives
demographic specific user data from MAGNIFI; (3) local/national sponsor pays a flat fee per show and offers product giveaways and/or raffle entries for a contest.  Example "Reservation" Definitions: (1) a socially broadcast interest in attending a
particular event (e.g., a "like" for an event that others may see), and then helping that general interest culminate in a tipping point where everyone wants to convert their Reservation into Ticket Buys to be guaranteed admission; (2) an option to
purchase a Ticket; (3) an opportunity for an individual to get a group of people to buy multiple tickets, and by doing so, the organizer (host) receives something of value from the venue; (4) a discrete unit of the allocation of Anticipated Unsold
Tickets multiplied by a super-percentage (100+%) According to different embodiments, a reservation window may close the sooner of (1) x days before the event or (2) X % of Tickets sold.  Alternatively, X days after the Reservation is made, but no later
than X days before the event.  Example Benefits/Advantages of MMMS System TRPS: Various benefits/advantages of the MMMS System TRPS may include, for example: the limited quantity of Reservations; the limited time window in which to convert Reservations
into Ticket Buys; and/or the social broadcast nature of the Reservation (allowing one or more MAGNIFI users to see the status of one or more Reservations for a given show at any time.
<br/><br/> Functionality for Display of Relevant Gigs on a Per-User Geo-Location Basis
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, when a MAGNIFI station is created, information relating to the station may be displayed or presented to the user via a Pop-Out Player GUI which may include one or more of the following types of content and/or features
(or combinations thereof): Venue Station: if the station created is venue-specific, then the first concert date displayed for at least one artist in that station matches the concert scheduled to occur at the venue(s) selected in the user's search
criteria.  Geographic proximity: if the station created is not venue-specific, and an artist in the station has an upcoming concert within a predetermined radius (e.g., 200 miles) of user's location (as determined by geo-locating the user's IP address or
user's mobile device, for example), then that concert within 200 miles of the user is the first displayed concert.  Chronologically: if the station created is not venue-specific, and an artist in the station does not have an upcoming concert within the
predetermined radius (e.g., 200 miles) of user's location (e.g., as determined by geo-located the user's IP Address or user's mobile device), then the concert that is occurring next chronologically is the first displayed concert.
<br/><br/> Stations Map Overlay Functionality
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, information relating to any given station created on MAGNIFI may be selectively displayed according to the user's viewing preferences, such as, for example: "List View" (e.g., FIG. 11), "Tile View" (e.g., FIG. 12) or
"Map View" (e.g., FIG. 13).  In one embodiment, when a genre and/or hometown station is viewed in map view, at least one artist's hometown is plotted on a map (e.g., using "guitar pick" icons to indicate the location(s) on the displayed map), and a
number inside the guitar pick indicating how many artists matching the search reside in that location (see, e.g., FIG. 13).  When a MAGNIFI Station for "shows near" city/neighborhood or one or more venues is created, the guitar pick icons indicate venue
locations where a concert that matches the search criteria may take place, and the number inside the guitar pick indicate how many artists matching the search may perform at that venue.  In either instance (hometown/genre stations or "shows near"
city/venue stations), clicking on a displayed icon may open a small window listing the artists matching the overall search criteria who are located (or who have upcoming concerts located) in or near the location indicated by the corresponding selected
icon.  In at least one embodiment, each of the List View, Tile View, and Map View GUIs may also include a "Play Station" button which enables a user to create a new station which is automatically configured to play only songs from the artists displayed
in the current window/GUI (and, in some embodiments, related artists as well).
<br/><br/> For example, creating a MAGNIFI Station of rock bands (without indicating a specific location) may include all rock bands on MAGNIFI.  The map view may initially only display rock bands within a certain radius of the user's IP Address or user's
mobile device.  The user may then zoom out to see one or more MAGNIFI rock bands across the world, as indicated by guitar picks for at least one location.  Clicking on a guitar pick over London, England, may reload the map view to focus only on London. 
Clicking on the guitar pick over London may open a window listing one or more the London rock bands.  The user may then click the play button to hear only rock bands from London.  This same example may be used for a "hometown" only station (e.g.,
indicating a search for one or more bands from a specific city or town) or a hybrid hometown/genre station (e.g., indicating a search for one or more bands of a specific genre (or genres) from a specific city or town).
<br/><br/> For example, creating a MAGNIFI Station of rock bands with upcoming shows within 100 miles of Amsterdam, Netherlands, when viewed in map view, may display one or more MAGNIFI rock bands with upcoming shows in this radius around Amsterdam.  In
one embodiment, at least a portion of the displayed icons on the map may represent or indicate venues where one or more of the show(s) (matching the filtered search criteria) are to take place.  In at least one embodiment, one or more displayed icons may
each display a numerical value indicating the number of upcoming shows at that particular venue for which ticket reservations/purchases are currently available.  In one embodiment, clicking on an icon may cause a Venue Info GUI to be displayed which
includes information about one or more bands matching the search criteria at that particular venue.  In one embodiment, a user may click a "Play" button displayed in the Venue Info GUI to dynamically generate a MAGNIFI Station playing only those bands at
that venue.
<br/><br/> Gig Sharing (User-to-User) Functionality
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, a user may select a particular concert/event from an artist's upcoming calendar, and share the event information (e.g., date, artists performing, location, ticket price, ticket purchase information, etc.) as well as
content associated with the performing artists (e.g., audio recordings, photos, biographical information, website links, <b><i>Facebook</i></b> URLs, Twitter URLs, etc.) directly with other MAGNIFI users (e.g., via MAGNIFI's Mobile Applications and web applications),
and associate a personal message from the sharer with the information shared.  This would present an opportunity for the "sharer" and the "sharee(s)" to express their interest in attending the show together, whether by making plans offline or purchasing
tickets online, including via the MAGNIFI Ticket Reservation Service.
<br/><br/> Social Blogging Functionality
<br/><br/> By embedding the MAGNIFI BloggerTool javascript in the &lt;head&gt; of their HTML pages, website operators may use MAGNIFI to provide playable links next to the textual mention of any Artist Name that currently has music available for public
streaming on MAGNIFI.  Clicking on a play link may launch the MAGNIFI Pop-Out Player that may either play the single artist that was clicked on, or a MAGNIFI Station comprising one or more artists (including the selected artist) with MAGNIFI music on
that web page.  A single web page may include multiple instances of the MAGNIFI BloggerTool.
<br/><br/> Play Traction Heat Map Functionality
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, artists may view an interactive world map overlaid with "heat zones" indicating where and to what degree listeners have been streaming that artist's music.  Artists may interact with a Play Traction Heat Map GUI to
change views and/or filter criteria to view mobile plays, website plays, or both combined.  In at least one embodiment, the Play Traction Heat Map Functionality may also be operable to enable the artist to further hone this map to a specific album or
track.
<br/><br/> Artist/Band Tweet @ Functionality
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, if an artist has provided their Twitter handle in their MAGNIFI artist profile, then, when a MAGNIFI listener is streaming an artist's recording on the MAGNIFI Mobile Application, with 1-click the user may send a
Twitter message ("tweet") directly at the artist's Twitter handle, with an automatically generated (or personalized) comment and a link to the artist's MAGNIFI station.  Any Twitter user who "follows" the MAGNIFI user sending the tweet, who follows the
artist on Twitter or who follows MAGNIFI on Twitter may see the tweet in their "feed." Any Twitter user who clicks on the link for the artist's station may view the artist's upcoming concert dates.  In one embodiment, the first date displayed may be
presented per the algorithm described in the "Display of Relevant Gigs on a Per User Geo-Location Basis" section.
<br/><br/> Auto-Magic Blog Functionality
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, any MAGNIFI City/Neighborhood/Venue "Shows Near" or "Bands From" station may include a more comprehensive display of related content via that station's own unique, automatically updating website (or GUI or webpage). 
The station's own unique, automated content updating website may be referred to as the "AutoMagic Blog." In one embodiment of the AutoMagic Blog, the MAGNIFI user responsible for owning or managing the station/blog would receive their own unique Twitter
handle for that station/blog (e.g. @drfm_oakland).  Information and/or other content which may be displayed at the AutoMagic Blog may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): A map showing the specified
radius for the station; The station's venue and/or artist search results overlaid on that map, with associated playable links; The station's search results of artists and concerts presented in list form; Artist profiles of at least one artist in the
search results; A MAGNIFI embedded player which plays the search results for that station; A customized "outgoing" twitter feed of one or more tweets from the blog's owner; A customized "incoming" twitter feed representing a real time search of one or
more tweets by twitter users who include in their tweet a hashtag for the blog (e.g. #drfm_oakland).  In at least one embodiment, the Blog's owner may "re-tweet" (e.g., from the owner's official Blog handle) any tweets containing the hashtag, thus
creating a method for Twitter users to tweet comments and a method for the Blog owner to officially recognize those comments by retweeting them; A "PLAY" button for the outgoing Twitter feed that uses technology to "scrape" any MAGNIFI station links,
allowing at least one tweet to be played as a MAGNIFI Station, or one or more tweets in the feed to be played as a separate station; A "PLAY" button for the incoming Twitter feed that uses technology to scrape any MAGNIFI station links, allowing at least
one tweet to be played as a MAGNIFI Station, or one or more tweets in the feed to be played as a separate station; Editorial content related to the artists and venues currently displayed, either linked in from outside websites or created within the Blog
itself by the Blog owner; Etc.
<br/><br/> Track-Level Control Slider Functionality
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, when an artist uploads audio recordings to MAGNIFI, the "Track-Level Control Slider" gives them fine-grain control over how their recordings are made available and promoted across the internet, based on a "promotional
sliding scale" that increases by degree of public availability.  In at least one embodiment, the Track-Level Control Slider GUI may be configured or designed to enable a user to assign one or more separately definable access and/or usage attributes to
each of the Artist's recordings (e.g., which have been uploaded to the MAGNIFI System).  Examples of such access and/or usage control attributes may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): For Sale Only:
Tracks marked as "for sale only" are not streamable anywhere on MAGNIFI, but downloads may be purchased on the artist's MAGNIFI profile page by listeners.  Profile Only: Tracks marked as "profile only" are streamable only on the artist's MAGNIFI profile
page via the Pop-Out Player (which may also be embedded elsewhere on the internet), but these tracks may not be included in the pool of tracks available for stations created by MAGNIFI users and stations automatically generated by MAGNIFI.  Radio
Enabled: Tracks marked as "radio enabled" may be streamable on the artist's MAGNIFI profile page via the Pop-Out Player, and may also be included in the pool of tracks available for stations created by MAGNIFI users and automatically generated by
MAGNIFI.  Radio Preferred: Same as Radio Enabled, but "Radio Preferred" tracks may be played first when this artist appears in a MAGNIFI station.  Free Download: This checkbox may be applied to any track, and may allow the free, promotional download of
the marked track.  Free downloads are only available on the artist's MAGNIFI profile page.
<br/><br/> Functionality for Targeted Promotion of Stations on the MAGNIFI Website, Based on User Location
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, the MAGNIFI homepage may be comprised in part of a "mosaic" of image "tiles", wherein each tile may depict a MAGNIFI station selected for promotion on the homepage, including but not limited to one or more of the
following (or combinations thereof): festival stations, venue stations, record label stations, artist stations, etc. These promotional mosaic tiles may be "tagged" in the MAGNIFI System as being associated with a specific geographic region or regions. 
For example, a festival taking place in New York may be tagged as being associated with the eastern coast of the United States.  When a user arrives at the MAGNIFI homepage, the user may be geo-located based on their IP Address or user's mobile device,
and the MAGNIFI homepage promotional mosaic tiles may be automatically and dynamically selected (e.g., in real-time) based on that user's location, such that the promotional mosaic tiles the user sees on the homepage may be directly geo-targeted to each
individual user.  For example, the MAGNIFI System may determine a first user's geolocation as being Paris, France, and in response, the MAGNIFI System may display to the user only promotional mosaic tiles associated with the geographic region(s) in and
around Paris.  In contrast, the MAGNIFI System may determine a second user's geolocation as being San Francisco, Calif., and may display to the second user only promotional mosaic tiles associated with the geographic region(s) in and around San
Francisco, Calif.
<br/><br/> Share a Gig Functionality
<br/><br/> Compatible with the conventional ways to share content between users and among existing social networks (e.g., <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, etc.), a MAGNIFI user may select a particular show or event from an artist's upcoming tour calendar, and share that
show/event via the MAGNIFI mobile and web apps.  This would mark a user's interest in that particular show, which may be visible to other users of the MAGNIFI System, and may present an opportunity to other MAGNIFI users to express their interest in the
identified show/event.
<br/><br/> Venue Check-in Functionality
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, mobile device users may use the MAGNIFI Mobile Application to "Check-In" at a show or event.  For example, in one embodiment, by accessing one or more databases relating to events, shows, and/or tour dates (e.g.,
including, for example, MAGNIFI tour date archive database), and using the geolocation services/functionality at the user's mobile device (at least a portion of which may be provided by the MAGNIFI Mobile Application), the venue check-in process may be
streamlined considerably as compared to more traditional methods of check-in. In at least one embodiment, the MAGNIFI Mobile Application may be configured or designed to include functionality for facilitating user "Check-In" activities at a given venue &amp;
event.  After completing a check-in activity at a given location, the user may be granted (e.g., via the MAGNIFI Mobile Application and/or MAGNIFI website) access to additional functionality, promotional opportunities, and/or rewards, such as, for
example, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): Join the venue email list Vote for upcoming shows (e.g., at that venue); Access current band's info, twitter, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> merchandise and email list signups; Incentives for discounted drinks
and/or merchandise; receive information or notification about friends or other MAGNIFI users who will be attending one or more show(s) at the venue and/or who have already check-in at the venue for the current show; Send photos to band and/or MAGNIFI
Band/Artist webpage or blog; Integrate with additional "check-in" services; Earn points for social activity which may be later redeemed by the user for promotional rewards, incentives, etc.
<br/><br/> Embedded Players and Extended Functionality
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, the MAGNIFI System technology disclosed herein provides capability for any MAGNIFI Station, Album, or Artist to be embedded in any webpage on the World Wide Web, using an &lt;iframe&gt; tag and HTML5 code, for
example.  The user may customize the appearance of the embedded player prior to receiving the code.  The user may customize: color scheme &amp; width of the player, along with choosing the visibility of tour dates, photos, &amp; station title.  In one
embodiment, when an embedded player is first loaded, it will cycle through the artists in the station in a random order, displaying one highlighted gig according to certain criteria.  This first displayed tour date is chosen with regards to the `closest
upcoming show` in geographic proximity, based on the geolocation of the user (e.g., via user's IP address or via geolocation of users mobile device).  If a MAGNIFI Station has been created based on specific `Venue Criteria`, the highlighted date(s) will
be the upcoming date(s) that occurs at one of the specified venue(s).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the Embedded Players and Extended Functionality may include the ability for a venue to embed a complete concert calendar which may include listings for bands that aren't currently members of MAGNIFI and/or which may include
bands which are not currently in the MAGNIFI database.  Concert calendars may be accompanied by additional GUI features/buttons in the embedded window for enabling features such as, for example, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof):
genre and date range selectors, multiple stages or associated venues, social sharing tools, etc.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, Track and Album embeds may be accompanied by corresponding track list(s), with additional GUI features/buttons in the embedded window for enabling features such as, for example, one or more of the following (or
combinations thereof): downloading the tracks, social sharing tools, favoriting/liking/following controls, purchase options, links to external sites for purchase/download, etc.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, a user may choose to customize and embed a button (e.g., via a &lt;script&gt; tag) that creates a button on an external web page that immediately triggers a pop-up window containing just the MAGNIFI player for that Station,
Artist or Track.  The Embedded Players and Extended Functionality may include is functionality for the embedded player to cycle through the photos of bands in the embedded station, even if the visitor to the website where the player is embedded has not
tapped or clicked on the "PLAY" button.  In at least one embodiment, this may result in the display of an automatically and/or dynamically generated "slideshow" of images of the artist(s) associated with that particular station.
<br/><br/>Examples
<br/><br/> The following examples are intended to help illustrate some of the various types of functions, operations, actions, and/or other features which may be provided by the MMMS System.  By way of example, described below are some examples of
"Stations" that may be created, named, saved, shared and listened to in real-time via the MMMS System, by adjusting the intuitive filters that appear in the various GUIs presented by the MMMS System.  (1) A MAGNIFI Station comprised of songs by indie
rock bands (or any other genre) that are playing shows within 10 miles San Francisco this Saturday night.  While the collection of songs is being streamed to the user's computer or mobile device, a photo slide-show of the current Artist is simultaneously
streamed and rotated on the listeners browser or mobile device.  Date and location of upcoming show nearby is displayed next to current Artist and track information.  In many urban areas, fans have the opportunity to see dozens of shows on any given
night.  By creating this station, they may be able to hear a selection of songs relating only to those Artists who have been identified as playing upcoming shows within 10 miles San Francisco within the specified time period.  Stations may be shared with
friends on <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> twitter or any other social media sites, instantly.  (2) A MAGNIFI Station comprised of bands from a high school, college, hometown, or any other geographical grouping.  In at least one embodiment, the MMMS System may include
functionality for enabling the user to post a link to a selected MAGNIFI Station on <b><i>Facebook</i></b> or social networks.  From there, one or more the user's friends may view the post/link, and may instantly listen to the MAGNIFI Station by clicking on the link
(for example).  In at least one embodiment, the user's social networking friends and/or other MAGNIFI users may be able to chat with the user (or with others) via a chat GUI which may be incorporated into the associated MAGNIFI Station web page. 
According to different embodiments, MAGNIFI Station chat functionality may be selectively enabled and/or disabled by the creator/owner of that MAGNIFI Station.  (3) A MAGNIFI Station comprised of choir music from choirs based in and around Oakland,
Calif.  Very many choir groups exist nationwide, and most of them make recordings which are difficult to promote and share publically.  A MAGNIFI `Oakland Choir Radio` Station may be dynamically created by the MMMS System and may be made to be publically
accessible a variety of different groups such as, for example, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): users/members of the MMMS System; social network friends and family; anyone who is able to obtain the URL to the MAGNIFI Oakland Choir
Radio Station (e.g., by doing a Google search, for example).  (4) A MAGNIFI Station comprised of California high school bands that rank in the top 100 "most popular", "most listened to", etc. Rankings may be generated and/or updated manually,
automatically, and/or programmatically via data gathered from statistics and analytics relating to artist and user actions, such as `track play count`, `page views`, `MMMS player spins`, most starred, `band preferred`, upcoming tour dates, etc. (5) A
MAGNIFI Station of US serviceman rock bands (stationed anywhere in the world.) May be active members only, or active and retired.  May be genre agnostic; for instance, it may be rap-specific, reggae, etc. Example MAGNIFI Station: One or more `Southern
Rock` groups, currently stationed in Iraq.  (6) A MAGNIFI Station comprised of bands made up of workers at Safeway supermarkets Once a MAGNIFI Safeway Station was created, bands that want to be included in this station may send requests to the station
owner asking to be added.  Stations may be earmarked as "closed" or "open" to non-owner manipulation of content.  Corporations may find this a healthy morale building enterprise, and may even promote it actively as such.  (7) A MAGNIFI Station comprised
of bands playing upcoming shows at a SPECIFIC VENUE.  A lot of music fans have a favorite venue(s).  The songs and artists associated with the Station may be automatically, dynamically and/or periodically updated so that it may be kept current with the
upcoming events, shows, artists, song popularity, etc. Venues may post links to their MAGNIFI Station on their web sites, and send links to their MAGNIFI Station out to recipients on the venue mailing list.  In at least one embodiment, the content
streamed by the MAGNIFI Venue Station may automatically and periodically be updated (e.g., "Always Be Current").  In one embodiment, the Station owner (e.g., which may be the venue's agent) may manually update MAGNIFI's database of upcoming shows and
events that particular venue.  In other embodiments, the MMMS System may automatically and periodically access updated venue-specific event/date/artist information from one or more remote databases and APIs such as, for example, those provided by,
Songkick, Last FM, etc. One significant advantage/benefit of the customized MAGNIFI Venue Station is that it facilitates and provides the ability for end users and customers to easily access, learn about, explore, and listen to music from bands/artists
who will be performing (and/or who have performed) at a given venue.  Venues may advantageously leverage the features and advantages by embedding their customized, venue-specific MAGNIFI Station in the home page (or other web pages) of the venue's
website.  Another significant advantage/benefit customized MAGNIFI Venue Station is that it allows the venue to offload the tasks of managing, uploading, and updating the venue's website with new music relating to the artists of upcoming shows.  For
example, in one embodiment, when the venue books an upcoming show with a given artist, the venue may simply instruct the artist to upload one or more of the artist's song(s) and/or album(s) to the MAGNIFI System.  In at least one embodiment, the MAGNIFI
System may include functionality for automatically monitoring newly uploaded content, and cross checking the identified content with other resources in order to automatically link selected portions of the newly uploaded content with selected MAGNIFI
Stations.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, the MMMS System may be configured or designed to automatically identify various types of criteria (e.g., song, artist, album, video, venue, user location, artist location, etc.) relating to content being displayed to
a user as the user accesses the MAGNIFI website and/or MAGNIFI Mobile Application.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, one or more GUIs may be displayed to the user to facilitate operation and/or initiation of the various features and functions disclosed herein.  According to different embodiments, the GUIs may be implemented via use

<br/><br/> As illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 2, the MMMS System may include one or more databases (e.g. 240, FIG. 2), which, for example, may be populated with information and/or content relating to music, videos, venues, events, merchants,
merchandise, artists, user profile information, user activity information, radio station information, etc.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, one or more of the databases may be queried via the use of various types of programming languages and/or protocols such as, for example, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): HTML, XML, MySQL, Perl,
Ajax, JavaScript, Etc.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, a user may initiate a MMMS session via the Internet (e.g., via 240, FIG. 2) to cause the MMMS System to perform and/or initiate various functions and operations (such as those described and/or referenced herein),
according to user-specified criteria.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, the MMMS System may be operable to populate and/or access information at Database(s) 214, and utilize such information in order to identify and/or determine artist information and/or music content according to
user-specified criteria.  Examples of such database information may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): artist profile criteria, including, but not limited to artist rating, artist feedback, etc.;

computations, network diagnostics, security functions, etc.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, some interfaces may be configured or designed to allow the server system 580 to communicate with other network devices associated with various local area network (LANs) and/or wide area networks (WANs).  Other
interfaces may be configured or designed to allow network device 560 to communicate with one or more direct attached storage device(s) 570.
<br/><br/> Although the system shown in FIG. 5 illustrates one specific network device described herein, it is by no means the only network device architecture on which one or more embodiments may be implemented.  For example, an architecture having a
single processor that handles communications as well as routing computations, etc. may be used.  Further, other types of interfaces and media may also be used with the network device.
<br/><br/> Regardless of network device's configuration, it may employ one or more memories or memory modules (such as, for example, memory block 565, which, for example, may include random access memory (RAM)) configured to store data, program
instructions for the general-purpose network operations and/or other information relating to the functionality of the various MMMS techniques described herein.  The program instructions may control the operation of an operating system and/or one or more
applications, for example.  The memory or memories may also be configured to store data structures, and/or other specific non-program information described herein.
<br/><br/> Because such information and program instructions may be employed to implement the systems/methods described herein, one or more embodiments relates to machine readable media that include program instructions, state information, etc. for
performing various operations described herein.  Examples of machine-readable storage media include, but are not limited to, magnetic media such as hard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical media such as CD-ROM disks; magneto-optical media
such as floptical disks; and hardware devices that may be specially configured to store and perform program instructions, such as read-only memory devices (ROM) and random access memory (RAM).  Some embodiments may also be embodied in transmission media
such as, for example, a carrier wave travelling over an appropriate medium such as airwaves, optical lines, electric lines, etc. Examples of program instructions include both machine code, such as produced by a compiler, and files containing higher level
code that may be executed by the computer using an interpreter.

<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, the MMMS System may be configured or designed to provide ticketing reservation and purchasing functionality for enabling and/or facilitating users in performing activities/operations relating to reservation and/or
purchasing of tickets to events such as live performances at one or more venues.  For example, in at least one embodiment, the MAGNIFI System may include a Ticketing Reservation/Purchase System ("TRPS") which, for example, may be configured or designed
to automatically and/or dynamically identify event ticketing reservation/purchasing opportunities in advance of tickets going on sale to the public.  According to different embodiments, various aspects of the MMMS System's ticketing reservation and
purchasing functionality may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): Venue Implementation: In at least one embodiment, the MMMS System may be configured or designed to provide ticketing reservation and
purchasing functionality for enabling and/or facilitating users in performing activities/operations relating to reservation and/or purchasing of tickets to events such as live performances at one or more venues.  For example, in at least one embodiment,
the MMMS System may include a Ticketing Reservation/Purchase System ("TRPS") which may be configured or designed to automatically and/or dynamically identify event ticketing reservation/purchasing opportunities in advance of tickets going on sale to the
public.  In one embodiment, reservation and/or purchasing of tickets by MAGNIFI users may be facilitated by 3rd party system(s)/component(s).  In at least one embodiment, at some point after the Initial Ticket On-Sale event (e.g., approximately 1-5 days
after), the venue hosting the event (e.g., concert/show) would set the Reservation Allotment for how many reservations it would guarantee/allot for a specific concert.  In one embodiment, to determine the Reservation Allotment, the venue may take their
"Sellable Capacity" less "Anticipated Sales", and the remaining number may be the Anticipated Unsold Tickets ("AUTs").  For example, a venue with a Sellable Capacity of 500 and Anticipated Sales of 300 may be provided with 200 AUTs remaining.  The TRPS
would multiply the venue's AUT by a "super percent" multiplier (e.g., 100+%), thus creating the Reservation Allotment for the event.  One reason for the super percentage multiplier is that not all reservations may be converted to a ticket purchase. 
Customer Interaction: In at least one embodiment, once the Reservation Allotment is available in the TRPS, MAGNIFI users may be able to view a Concert Page for a particular event.  On the Concert Page, the user may view (e.g., in real-time) information
relating to the total number of tickets sold for that event and the number of reservations available.  MAGNIFI users may be able to "buy now" for immediate ticket purchase and/or be able to make ticket reservations (e.g., for one or more persons).  In
one embodiment where MAGNIFI users may "star" particular venues, MAGNIFI users may receive an update when an event is scheduled at one of their starred venues, and by clicking on the update, they may be directed to the Concert Page for that event, where
they may purchase tickets and/or make Reservations.  Making the Reservation: In at least one embodiment, when making the Reservation, the Reservation Host may be able to designate other MAGNIFI users (Reservation Recipients) to receive an "invitation to
accept the Reservation." This message may be sent within MAGNIFI to Reservation Recipients.  The Host and the Recipients may be provided with a window of time in which to convert their Reservations into Ticket purchases.  Once the Host has received
confirmation from Recipients of their intent to attend the show as a group (e.g., via MAGNIFI SMS, text message, phone call, in person, etc.), the Reservation Host may automatically handle the Ticket purchases on behalf of the Reservation Group.  Picking
up Tickets purchased through TRPS: In at least one embodiment, the venue keeps track of tickets purchased through at least one Reservation Group in the TRPS.  The Host of at least one Reservation Group is now "hosting" a "guest list" of attendees at the
event.  At least one member of the Reservation Group arrives at the venue, informs Will Call that they're on the Reservation Host's Guest List, presents ID, and receives their Ticket.  Reservation Incentives: In at least one embodiment, venues
participating in the TRPS may be able to access their Venue Dashboard, select a particular event, and set any incentives/discounts it wants to offer for that event.  The Reservation Host would then be eligible for deals as an incentive for buying AUTs in
bulk, for example.  In at least one embodiment, MAGNIFI users who reserve or purchase their tickets via the MAGNIFI System may receive other types of promotional offers or benefits such as, for example: Bulk Ticket Discount: By way of example, 5 tickets
for the price of 4, with the discount spread across the price of one or more tickets, thus benefiting the Reservation Group.  The venue is only getting income from 4 ticket sales, but the event will be attended by 5 persons who may generate other income
for the venue while attending the show.  Promotional Offers: drink tickets, venue swag, VIP privileges, priority seat reservations, discount coupons, etc. Future Show Discounts: Discounts on Ticket purchases for future shows at that venue, or at shows
among various venues in a Venue Group.  Vendor Affiliate Discounts: Discounts at vendors/merchants in the same neighborhood as the venue.  Venue "Points": Redeemable by the Host at the venue at some later date for any of the above.  TRPS Monetization:
Monetization of the TRPS may take one or more of the following forms (or combinations thereof): Per Ticket Fee; Per Order Fee; and/or Per Show Fee.  Example Models for Sponsorship Sales: (1) local/national sponsor underwrites one or more fees and is
perceived as paying one or more convenience fees related to Tickets purchased through the TRPS for that event, in exchange for brand goodwill and/or user data provided by MAGNIFI; (2) local/national sponsor pays a flat fee per show to buy a relationship
with a specific demographic and receives demographic specific user data from MAGNIFI; (3) local/national sponsor pays a flat fee per show and offers product giveaways and/or raffle entries for a contest.  Example "Reservation" Definitions: (1) a socially
broadcast interest in attending a particular event (e.g., a "like" for an event that others may see), and then helping that general interest culminate in a tipping point where everyone wants to convert their Reservation into Ticket Buys to be guaranteed
admission; (2) an option to purchase a Ticket; (3) an opportunity for an individual to get a group of people to buy multiple tickets, and by doing so, the organizer (host) receives something of value from the venue; (4) a discrete unit of the allocation
of Anticipated Unsold Tickets multiplied by a super-percentage (100+%) According to different embodiments, a reservation window may close the sooner of (1) x days before the event or (2) X % of Tickets sold.  Alternatively, X days after the Reservation
is made, but no later than X days before the event.  Example Benefits/Advantages of MMMS System TRPS: Various benefits/advantages of the MMMS System TRPS may include, for example: the limited quantity of Reservations; the limited time window in which to
convert Reservations into Ticket Buys; and/or the social broadcast nature of the Reservation (allowing one or more MAGNIFI users to see the status of one or more Reservations for a given show at any time.
<br/><br/> FIG. 7 shows example screenshots of a sequence of several Ticket Reservation GUIs which may be configured or designed to provide ticketing reservation and purchasing functionality for enabling and/or facilitating users in performing
activities/operations relating to reservation and/or purchasing of tickets to events such as live performances at one or more venues.  For example, in at least one embodiment, the MAGNIFI System may include a Ticketing Reservation/Purchase System
("TRPS") which may be configured or designed to automatically and/or dynamically identify event ticketing reservation/purchasing opportunities in advance of tickets going on sale to the public.  In one embodiment, reservation and/or purchasing of tickets
by MAGNIFI users may be facilitated by 3.sup.rd party system(s)/component(s).  In at least one embodiment, at some point after the Initial Ticket On-Sale event (e.g., approximately 1-5 days after), the venue hosting the event (e.g., concert/show) would
set the Reservation Allotment for how many reservations it would guarantee/allot for a specific concert.  In one embodiment, to determine the Reservation Allotment, the venue may take their "Sellable Capacity" less "Anticipated Sales", and the remaining
number may be the Anticipated Unsold Tickets ("AUTs").  For example, a venue with a Sellable Capacity of 500 and Anticipated Sales of 300 may be provided with 200 AUTs remaining.  The TRPS would multiply the venue's AUT by a "super percent" multiplier
(e.g., 100+%), thus creating the Reservation Allotment for the event.  One reason for the super percentage multiplier is that not all reservations may be converted to a ticket purchase.  In at least one embodiment, once the Reservation Allotment is
available in the TRPS, MAGNIFI users may be able to view a Concert Page for a particular event (e.g., 710).  On the Concert Page, the user may view (e.g., in real-time) information (e.g., 712) relating to the total number of tickets sold for that event,
and the number of reservations available.  MAGNIFI users may be able to indicate the quantity of tickets to be purchased/reserved (e.g., via GUI portion 714), and elect to purchase tickets 717 for immediate ticket purchase and/or elect to make
reservations 716 (e.g., for one or more persons).  In one embodiment where MAGNIFI users may "star" particular venues, MAGNIFI users may receive an update when an event is scheduled at one of their starred venues, and by clicking on the update, they may
be directed to the Concert Page for that event, where they may purchase tickets and/or make reservations.  As illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 7, at 720 is assumed that the user has initiated the process of reserving tickets for a selected
show at a specific venue.  In at least one embodiment, the user may be presented with options for performing additional tasks such as, for example: invite friends 724; add to event to calendar 726; post or share information relating to the user's ticket
reservation activities (e.g., in the MAGNIFI System and/or at one or more social networks); confirm ticket reservations 729; purchased the reserved tickets; make additional ticket reservations/purchases; pre-purchase items of merchandise available at the
upcoming show; elect to receive updates relating to the selected show; elect to join the mailing list of the artist/band and/or venue which will be hosting the show; etc. In at least one embodiment, when making the Reservation, the Reservation Host may
be able to designate other MAGNIFI users (Reservation Recipients) to receive an invitation to accept the Reservation (e.g., as shown at 730).  This message may be sent within MAGNIFI to Reservation Recipients.  The Host and the Recipients may be provided
with a window of time in which to convert their Reservations into Ticket purchases.  Once the Host has received confirmation from Recipients of their intent to attend the show as a group (e.g., via MAGNIFI SMS, text message, phone call, in person, etc.),
the Reservation Host may automatically handle the Ticket purchases on behalf of the Reservation Group.  In at least one embodiment, the venue keeps track of tickets purchased through at least one Reservation Group in the TRPS.  The Host of at least one
Reservation Group is now "hosting" a "guest list" of attendees at the event.  At least one member of the Reservation Group arrives at the venue, informs Will Call that they're on the Reservation Host's Guest List, presents ID, and receives their Ticket.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 8-15 illustrate example screenshots of various graphical user interfaces (GUIs) which may be used to facilitate, initiate and/or perform various operation(s) and/or action(s) relating event ticket reservations and purchasing operations
implemented via a user's mobile device.  According to specific embodiments, at least a portion of the content and functionality of ticked reservation and purchasing GUIs illustrated in FIGS. 8-15 may be implemented at the MAGNIFI System.
<br/><br/> FIG. 8 shows an example embodiment illustrating a view of the MAGNIFI Ticket Reservation icon 830a from the MAGNIFI Player GUI 801.  In at least one embodiment, a user of the mobile device may click on the Ticket Reservation icon 830a to access
additional GUIs for facilitating event-related online ticket reservations and purchasing transactions.
<br/><br/> In the present example, it is assumed that the user has tapped the Ticket Reservation icon 830a of FIG. 8, and has been directed to the artist's Event Information GUI 901 (FIG. 9), which has been configured or designed to display listings of
upcoming events associated with the identified artist (e.g., Angelo Moore).  In at least one embodiment, as illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 9, events (e.g., 912, 914) where ticket reservations are determined to be available may include
display of a respective Ticket Reservation icon (e.g., 912a, 914a) adjacent to each corresponding event.  In at least one embodiment, the MAGNIFI System may dynamically determine (e.g., in real-time) available ticket reservation opportunities (if any)
for each of the events listed in the artist's upcoming events list 910.
<br/><br/> In the present example, it is assumed that the user has tapped on event listing 912 of FIG. 9 (titled "Brooklyn Bowl").  In response, as illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 10, an Artist-Event GUI 1001 may be displayed, which may be
configured or designed to provide functionality for enabling the user to initiate, and/or perform one or more of the following operation(s), action(s), and/or feature(s) (or combinations thereof): View and/or obtain additional information (e.g., 1012,
1014) relating to the selected artist event.  Listen to one or more the artists performing at the event together in one station (e.g., by tapping on "play" button 1022 to initiate playback of a streaming radio station).  Get directions to the event
(e.g., by tapping on map portion 1010).  Share the event with friends on their social networks (e.g., 1034).  Initiate ticket reservations for the selected event (e.g., 1032).  Return to the Player GUI of the artist the user is currently listening to
(e.g., by tapping on portion 1040).
<br/><br/> In the present example, it is assumed that the user has tapped "Reserve Tickets" button 1032 of FIG. 10.  In response, as illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 11, an Event-Reservation GUI 1101 may be displayed, which may be configured
or designed to provide functionality for enabling the user to initiate, and/or perform one or more of the following operation(s), action(s), and/or feature(s) (or combinations thereof): View and/or obtain additional information (e.g., 1110) relating to
the selected event (e.g., Artists to be performing, Date, Show Time, etc.).  View and/or obtain additional information (e.g., 1120) relating to the venue (e.g., venue name, venue location, etc.).  View and/or obtain additional information (e.g., 1120)
relating to pricing for ticket reservations/purchases for the selected event.  Input the number of tickets to be reserved or purchased for the selected event (e.g., 1130).  Initiate ticket reservations for the selected event (e.g., 1138) for one or more
persons.  Return to the Player GUI of the artist the user is currently listening to (e.g., by tapping on portion 1140).
<br/><br/> In the present example, it is assumed that the user has provided input indicating that the user wishes to reserve 4 tickets (e.g., as shown at 1130) for the identified show/event.  It is further assumed that the user then taps the "Make
Reservation" button 1138.  In at least one embodiment, after the user has tapped on the "Make Reservation" button 1138, a confirmation message may be displayed on the mobile device prompting the user to confirm the reservation of the requested number of
tickets for the identified event.  In some embodiments, the confirmed ticket reservations may be held only for a specified duration of time before the reservations automatically expire.  If the user does not purchase the reserved tickets within the
specified time duration, the reservations may automatically expire.  In some embodiments, a separate reservation fee may be charged for the privilege of reserving or holding tickets to a given event.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the MAGNIFI System may be configured or designed to enable the user to reserve a desired number of tickets for a selected event.  Additionally, the MAGNIFI System may be configured or designed to facilitate the user in
identifying and inviting one or more friends (or other persons) to accept one or more of the ticket reservations made by the user.  One example of this feature is illustrated in FIG. 12.
<br/><br/> In the present example, after the user has reserved a selected number of tickets for a selected show, as described, for example, with respect to FIG. 11, the user may be presented with a Reservation Invitation GUI, such as, for example,
Reservation Invitation GUI 1201 of FIG. 12.  In at least one embodiment, the Reservation Invitation GUI may be configured or designed to facilitate and/or enable the user to identify and select one or more friends (or other persons) 1210 for the purpose
of inviting the selected friends/persons to accept one or more of the ticket reservations made by the user for the selected show.  The user may choose from their MAGNIFI Friends (as shown, for example, in FIG. 12) and/or may select from a list of
contacts outside the MAGNIFI System such as via <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, mobile device address book, etc. According to different embodiments, the invitations may be sent to the selected recipients via one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): via
a MAGNIFI System messaging service, via one or more social network messaging service(s) (e.g., <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, etc.), via email, via SMS (as indicated in the "Add Friends" tab), etc. In the specific example embodiment of FIG. 12, it is assumed that
the user has selected to invite 12 MAGNIFI Friends to accept the 4 reservations.  In at least one embodiment, when an invited recipient receives the invitation request, that recipient may perform one or more of the following types of activities (or
combinations thereof): Accept the reservation invitation.  Purchase one or more of the reserved tickets.  Decline the reservation invitation.  Forward the reservation invitation to one or more other persons.  In at least one embodiment, the MAGNIFI
System may be configured or designed to only allow the invitation recipient to forward the reservation invitation to one or more other persons who share a common friendship connection with both the user who made the original ticket reservations and the
recipient who is forwarding the reservation invitation.  Make additional ticket reservations for the selected show.  Send a personal communication back to the user who sent the reservation invitation.  Utilize features embedded in the received
reservation invitation to view details or information relating to one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): details about the upcoming show; information about the artist(s) who will be performing at the show; information about the venue
where the selected show will be performed; etc. Utilize features embedded in the received reservation invitation to access and/or listen to a customized MAGNIFI station which plays streamed music performed by one or more of the artist(s) who will be
performing at the selected show.  Utilize features embedded in the received reservation invitation to access and/or listen to a customized MAGNIFI station which plays streamed music performed by one or more of the artist(s) who will be performing at the
selected show.  Etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 13 shows an example embodiment of a User Reservation Status GUI 1301 in accordance with a specific embodiment.  In the specific example embodiment of FIG. 13, the User Reservation Status GUI has been configured to present a list view of a
user's upcoming reservations.  In at least one embodiment, the User Reservation Status GUI may be configured or designed to display information relating to each of the user's existing reservations, as well as updated status information relating to each
of the user's existing reservations.  For example, as illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 13, the updated status information relating to reservation entry 1312 (for the Angelo Moore show) indicates that 5 reservation invitations have been
confirmed or accepted out of a total of 8 reservations made by the user.  Additionally, the updated status information relating to reservation entry 1316 (for the Sister Sparrow show) indicates that 2 reservation invitations have been confirmed or
accepted out of a total of 4 reservations made by the user, and also indicates that the reservations (and/or reservation invitations) are due to expire if the reservations are not ticketed within 24 hours.  As illustrated in FIG. 13, colors may be used
to indicate a current state or current status of each respective reservation.
<br/><br/> In the present example, it is assumed that the user taps or clicks on reservation entry 1312 of the User Reservation Status GUI.  In response, the user may be presented with a Reservation Details GUI as illustrated by 1401 of FIG. 14.  As
illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 14, the Reservation Details GUI 1401 may present the user with a variety of information and/or other types of functionality relating to the selected reservation such as, for example, one or more of the
following (or combinations thereof): Details about the upcoming show associated with the selected reservation (e.g., 1412).  Information about the artist(s) who will be performing at the show (e.g., 1412).  Information about the venue where the selected
show will be performed (e.g., 1412).  Information relating to confirmations from friends who have accepted the user's invitation for a reserved ticket 1414 (e.g., 1414).  Information relating to the user's remaining available reserved tickets associated
with the selected reservation (e.g., 1412, 1414).  Functionality for sending out additional reservation invitations to additional persons (e.g., 1422).  Functionality for sending communications to one or more of the reservation invitation recipients
(e.g., 1424).  Functionality for viewing additional information relating to currently outstanding and/or declined reservation invitations for the selected show (e.g., 1426).  Functionality for accepting or confirming a ticket reservation for the selected
show (e.g., 1428).  Functionality for to access and/or listen to a customized MAGNIFI station which plays streamed music performed by one or more of the artist(s) who will be performing at the selected show (e.g., 1440).
<br/><br/> Thus, for example, in at least one embodiment, the user may choose to invite more friends; send a message via email or SMS to confirmed invitees; view the status of current outstanding and declined invitations; confirm the ticket reservations
with the MAGNIFI System; etc.
<br/><br/> In one embodiment, if the user taps or clicks on the "View Current Invitations" button 1426, the user may then be presented with an Invitation Status GUI such as that illustrated by 1501 of FIG. 15.  As illustrated in the example embodiment of
FIG. 15, the Invitation Status GUI may be configured or designed to enable the user to view additional information relating to currently outstanding and/or declined reservation invitations for the selected show.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, when a user elects to confirm a ticket reservation via one of the MAGNIFI System GUIs, a notification message may be automatically generated by the Ticket Reservation/Purchasing System (e.g., MAGNIFI System) and sent
out to one or more persons which, for example, may include one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): the user who made the reservation (if different from the confirming user), one or more of the reservation invitation recipients (e.g.,
1414), one or more of the confirming user's friends who have also purchased the reserved a ticket for the same show, etc.
<br/><br/> Additionally, in some embodiments, when a user elects to confirm a ticket reservation via one of the Ticket Reservation/Purchasing System (e.g., MAGNIFI System) GUIs, the user may be presented with a Ticket Purchasing GUI which may be configured
or designed to facilitate the user in purchasing a ticket corresponding to the confirmed ticket reservation.
<br/><br/> FIG. 17 depicts an overview of one embodiment of various actions or operations which may occur during an Event Ticket Reservation Group process conducted for a specific Reservation Group Host.  This embodiment outlines the process as follows:
The Host indicates (1710) that they would like to reserve tickets for an upcoming event.  The Host selects (1712) a number of tickets they would like to reserve (e.g., 5).  The Host selects/identifies (1714) Invitees to invite to join the Reservation
Group.  The Host enters (1716) their payment information for the number of tickets they reserved for themselves.  In some embodiments, the Host's payment info may also be used to fund payment of ticket reservations and/or purchases for tickets reserved
by other Invitees.  The Host sends out (1718) invitations to the selected Invitees to join the Reservation Group and claim reserved tickets to the upcoming event.
<br/><br/> FIG. 18 illustrates one embodiment of a Ticket Reservation Event Page GUI 1801 for an upcoming event.  As illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 18, the Ticket Reservation Event Page GUI may be configured or designed to include
functionality for accessing or displaying one or more of the following types of content, features, functions, etc.: Event information including, for example, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): event date; event time; event day; event
venue information; artists/bands who will be performing at the event; event location; etc. Ticket reservation functionality 1818.  Ticket purchasing functionality 1812.  Event calendaring functionality 1814.  Social media sharing functionality 1816. 
Information 1820 relating to other persons in the host's social network(s) who will be (and/or will not be) attending the event.  Electronic Conversation/Messaging functionality 1830.  For example, as illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 18,
Ticket Reservation Event Page GUI includes an event comment thread (e.g., 1830).  Functionality 1840 for accessing additional information relating to the event including, for example, similar upcoming shows.
<br/><br/> Different embodiments of Ticket Reservation Event Page GUI may be configured or designed to display a "group ticketing" or "ticket reservation" link or button (e.g., 1818) that is placed on an event or ticketing website, whether within the
MAGNIFI platform, on a venue's website, on a ticketing company's website, or elsewhere.  The "ticket reservation" button/link can be separate and distinct from a "buy tickets" button/link, or the ticket reservation functionality could be accessed by a
user once the user clicks a "buy tickets" button/link.  When a user clicks the "ticket reservation" button/link, one or more computer-implemented "Reservation Host" protocols may be automatically initiated.
<br/><br/> FIG. 19 illustrates an example screenshot of a User Onboarding GUI 1901 which may be configured or designed to include group ticketing related functionality which, for example, may include providing an overview of the ticketing reservation
process for the group ticketing "Host" or initiator.  As illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 19, the Host is presented with event information such as, for example, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): artist name 1902, event
date 1904, event location/venue 1906, ticket price 1908 (if available), artist image or video 1910, etc.
<br/><br/> In the specific example embodiment of FIG. 18, it is assumed that the ticket reservation process includes at least 3 primary steps: Choosing 1920 the number of tickets they wish to reserve for themselves and for their friends/invitees; Sending
1930 invitations to those invitees; and Reserving 1940 the tickets for a window of time by entering their payment information.
<br/><br/> In at least one embodiment, the ticket reservation functionality is configured or designed such that the Host only pays for the number of tickets they reserve for themselves, and any Invitees pay for tickets claimed by such Invitees during the
reservation acceptance process.  Once the Host is ready, they click the "Next" button to advance to the first step in the group ticketing process.  It is notable that the display and ordering of the text and graphics on FIG. 19 may vary, as variations
may be user tested to determine optimum adoption, and as displays are reconfigured and optimized for various electronic communication devices (such as laptops, PCs, mobile phones and other handheld devices) and for mobile applications.  It should also be
noted that the number of steps (and substeps) involved in initiating and/or completing a ticket reservation group may vary depending on the embodiment.
<br/><br/> FIGS. 20-33 describe one example embodiment of the various steps and substeps which may be involved for initiating and completing a group ticket reservation transaction for an identified reservation group.
<br/><br/> FIG. 20 illustrates an example screenshot of a graphical user interface (GUI) 2001 which may be used to facilitate, initiate and/or perform various operation(s) and/or action(s) relating to a group ticketing reservation transaction such as, for
example, enabling the Host to specify the number of tickets which the Host desires to reserve for his/her friends (e.g., via GUI portion 2050).  In the specific embodiment of FIG. 20, it is assumed that the Host specifies that he wishes to reserve a
total of eight tickets for his friends and Invitees.  In some embodiments, the reserved tickets may only be purchased by Invitees who were invited (or identified) by the Host.  For example, in some embodiments, the reserved tickets may only be purchased
by persons who are direct friends with the Host.  In other embodiments, at least a portion of the reserved tickets may be purchased by persons who were invited (or identified) by one or more of the Invitees.  For example, in some embodiments, at least a
portion of the reserved tickets may be purchased by persons who are friends of friends of the Host.  In at least some embodiments, this feature may be separately and/or independently configurable by the Host for each different group ticketing reservation
transaction initiated by the Host.
<br/><br/> As illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 20, the group ticketing reservation initiation process may involve the Host selecting the total number of tickets that the Host wishes to reserve for himself and his Invitees.  The progress of the
group ticketing reservation transaction may be graphically displayed via the "progress bar" 2010, which shows that the host is currently at the "# of Tickets" step 2012.
<br/><br/> According to different embodiments, the number of tickets available to be reserved (as displayed on the interface) may vary depending on configurations, as well as ticket allotments provided by venues, ticketing companies, artists and/or
promoters.  The interface may default automatically to a selection when the page is loaded by the user.  In this image, the Host has selected to reserve 8 tickets.  When the Host is satisfied with their selection, they may click the "Next" button to
advance to the next step in the process.
<br/><br/> FIG. 21 illustrates an example screenshot of a graphical user interface (GUI) 2101 which may be configured or designed to enable the Host to input or specify how many tickets from the reservation should be reserved for the Host to claim.  In at
least one embodiment, the number of reserved tickets available to be claimed by the Host would be the total number of tickets in the reservation minus one ticket.  In the specific example embodiment of FIG. 21, it is assumed that the host elects to claim
for himself, two tickets from the reserved group of eight tickets.
<br/><br/> Additionally, as illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 21 GUI 2101 may also include functionality for enabling the Host to dynamically select whether: (i) the two reserved tickets to be claimed by the Host should be purchased
conditionally (e.g., 2114) (e.g., conditioned upon reservation acceptance and ticket purchase by one or more Invitees); or (ii) whether the two reserved tickets to be claimed by the Host should be purchased unconditionally (e.g., 2112) (e.g. without
regard to any Invitee behavior) either immediately or automatically at the end of the reservation window.
<br/><br/> In at least some embodiments, the Ticket Reservation/Purchasing System may be configured or designed to enable the Host to configure or define one or more conditional purchase parameters (e.g., to be satisfied for triggering automatic
conditional purchasing of the Host's reserved tickets), such as, for example one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): Specifying a minimum number of Invitees which to complete their reservation acceptance and ticket purchase(s) before
conditional purchasing of the Host's reserved tickets is triggered.  For example: number of friends who must accept reserved ticket(s), number of friends who must purchase reserved ticket(s).  Identifying one or more specific Invitees who need to
complete their respective reservation acceptance and ticket purchase(s) before conditional purchasing of the Host's reserved tickets is triggered.  For example: specific friends who must accept reserved ticket(s), specific friends who must purchase
reserved ticket(s).  Specifying a time window by which one or more Invitees need to complete their reservation acceptance and ticket purchase(s) before conditional purchasing of the Host's reserved tickets is triggered.  For example: time frame for
accepting reserved ticket(s), time frame for purchasing reserved ticket(s).  Specifying a tiered pricing structure for purchasing one or more reserved tickets.  For example: tiered reserved ticket pricing based on time (e.g., price of purchasing reserved
ticket is $5 if purchased w/in 24 hours, price of purchasing reserved ticket is $7 if purchased after 24 hours, price of purchasing reserved ticket is $10 if purchased on day of event, price of purchasing reserved ticket is $3 if purchased 5 minutes
after start of event).  tiered reserved ticket pricing based on availability (e.g., two reserved tickets available for purchase for $5 each, three reserved tickets available for purchase for $7 each).  Etc.
<br/><br/> Based on the Host's selection of 8 total tickets to be held in the reservation in FIG. 20, the Host is providing additional input in FIG. 21 that 2 of these 8 tickets should be reserved for the Host and that these 2 tickets should be purchased
unconditionally (2112).  When the Host is satisfied with their selection, they click the "Next" button to advance to the next screen.
<br/><br/> FIG. 22 illustrates an example screenshot of a graphical user interface (GUI) 2201 which may be configured or designed to enable the Host to create (or log into) a MAGNIFI account (or other ticket reservation account, as appropriate) to continue
the ticket reservation transaction.  In some embodiments, the Host may be required to create (or log into) a ticket reservation account for a variety of reasons, including, for example, verifying that the Host is an actual person and not a ticket scalper
bot.  In some embodiments, the Host's reservation information may be stored in account dedicated to the Host.  Such account registration may be accomplished via social network verification, including but not limited to <b><i>Facebook</i></b> account login, or by
directly creating a MAGNIFI account with the sign up prompts such as first name, last name, email address, username, password.  The Host may also have the ability to return to and edit their previous selections (depicted in FIGS. 20 and 21).  Once the
Host has created or log into a suitable ticket reservation account, the Host may advance to the next screen by clicking the button labeled "Next".
<br/><br/> FIG. 23 illustrates an example screenshot of a graphical user interface (GUI) 2301 which may be configured or designed to enable the Host to input or otherwise provide access to contact information (e.g., 2310) for the identified Invitees that
the Host wishes to invite to join the Reservation Group.  The Host may manually type in Invitee email addresses, select specific contacts within the MAGNIFI platform, import contacts from other online sources (2312), etc. The Host may also have the
ability to return to and edit their previous selections.  The Host may also share a link (2332) to the ticket reservation group invitation online via social channels such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b> and Twitter.  In an alternate embodiment, the Host may be able to
access previous Invitee lists from previous Reservation Groups in order to copy some/all of those Invitees into the current Reservation Group.  Additionally, as illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 22, GUI
<br/><br/> FIG. 24 illustrates an example screenshot of a graphical user interface (GUI) 2401 which may be configured or designed to enable the Host to dynamically select/configure various aspects of the group ticket reservation such as, for example: the
number of tickets reserved for the themselves 2412, the number of tickets reserved for Invitees 2414, enable/disable sharing 2420 of the Reservation Group invitation through social channels such as <b><i>Facebook</i></b> 2422, Twitter 2424 and Instagram 2426;
enable/disable ability for Invitees to add Additional Invitees to the Reservation Group 2430.
<br/><br/> FIG. 25 illustrates an example screenshot of a graphical user interface (GUI) 2501 which may be configured or designed to enable the Host to view, edit and/or modify the Group Reservation Invitee list (e.g., 2514).  According to different
embodiments, editing/modifying the Group Reservation Invitee list may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): Adding Invitees to the Reservation Group; Deleting Invitees from the Reservation Group; Import
other contacts 2512 from other sources, such as, for example, <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Gmail, MAGNIFI, etc.; Etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 26 illustrates an example screenshot of a graphical user interface (GUI) 2601 which may be configured or designed to enable the Host to associate a name with a specific Invitee email address or phone number (e.g., as shown at 2602, 2604),
so that this information may be saved in the Host's MAGNIFI account (and/or other network account) for future Reservation Groups.  In at least some mobile device environments, the Host may invite Invitees by entering the phone numbers of the Invitees to
cause one or more text/SMS invitation message(s) to be sent to the identified Invitee(s).
<br/><br/> FIG. 27 illustrates an example screenshot of a graphical user interface (GUI) 2701 which may be configured or designed to enable the Host to add additional Invitees to the Group Reservation.  In at least some embodiments, the MAGNIFI System may
restrict the number of Invitees of a given Group Reservation, which may be based at least partially on the number of tickets being reserved.  For example, as illustrated in the example embodiment of FIG. 27, the Ticket Reservation/Purchasing System
(e.g., MAGNIFI) System may allow the Host to invite up to twice the number of reserved tickets.  In at least some mobile device environments, the Host may invite Invitees by entering the phone numbers of the Invitees to cause one or more text/SMS
invitation message(s) to be sent to the identified Invitee(s) (e.g., as shown at 2720).
<br/><br/> FIG. 28 illustrates an example screenshot of a graphical user interface (GUI) 2801 which may be configured or designed to enable the Host to review, update, and/or modify the Group Reservation Invitee list.  As illustrated in the example
embodiment of FIG. 28, it is assumed that the Host has entered contact information for five Invitees 2810.  One of the Invitees will receive a Reservation Group invitation via email, and four of the Invitees will receive a Reservation Group invitation
via SMS.
<br/><br/> FIG. 29 illustrates an example screenshot of a graphical user interface (GUI) 2901 which may be configured or designed to enable the Host to view ticket purchase pricing information (2930) for one or more tickets reserved by the Host.  In the
specific example embodiment of FIG. 29, it is assumed that the Host has reserved a total of 8 tickets (2910), 2 of which the Host has reserved for himself (2920), and 6 of which the Host has reserved for Invitees.  GUI 2901 also indicates (2910) that the
purchasing of the Host's 2 reserved tickets is non-conditional.  In at least some embodiments, the Host may have another opportunity to edit or modify their selection of total tickets reserved, tickets reserved for the Host, and/or whether Host-reserved
tickets should be purchased conditionally or unconditionally.  If the Host makes a change to the number of Host-reserved tickets, the ticket purchase information may be automatically and dynamically adjusted to implement/reflect the new
selection(s)/modification(s).
<br/><br/> FIG. 30 illustrates an example screenshot of a graphical user interface (GUI) 3001 which may be configured or designed to enable the Host to enter their payment information (e.g., via GUI portion 3010) in order to reserve and/or purchase their
Host-reserved tickets.  The Host may have the Ticket Reservation/Purchasing System (e.g., MAGNIFI System) store the Host's payment information for future Reservation Group initiations.  In the specific example embodiment of FIG. 30 (e.g., as shown at
3020), it is assumed that the Host has previously indicated that they wish to purchase their Host-reserved tickets conditionally (e.g., when a minimum specified number of Invitees join the Reservation Group and purchase Invitee tickets).  The Host may
"follow" the venue and/or the artist performing at the Reservation Group event (e.g., as shown at 3010), in order to receive notifications about future events involving the venue and/or the performing artist.  The window of time (e.g., as shown at 3020)
in which the Reservation must be converted into a ticket purchase may be displayed, such that the Host understands the time constraint.  According to different embodiments, this window of time may vary event by event depending on configurations and
requirements of artists, venues, ticketing companies, promoters, Ticket Reservation/Purchasing System, etc.
<br/><br/> FIG. 31 illustrates an example screenshot of a graphical user interface (GUI) 3101 which may be configured or designed to enable the Host to view a summary page providing the details of the Reservation Group they are about to initiate.  Such
confirmation page may indicate, for example, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): The total number of tickets reserved, the window of time in which the reservations must be converted into ticket purchases; How many of the total
reserved tickets are Host-reserved tickets; How many of the total reserved tickets are Invitee-reserved tickets; Whether the Host-reserved tickets should be purchased conditionally upon the reservation acceptance and ticket purchase of one or more
Invitees, or unconditionally regardless of whether an Invitee purchases tickets or not.  Whether Invitees may add Additional Invitees to the Reservation Group and whether a Reservation Group invitation may be shared publicly online.  And/or other details
about the Host's configuration of the Reservation Group.
<br/><br/> FIG. 32 illustrates alternate embodiment of a Reservation Group Summary Page GUI 3201 in which the Host has either previously indicated that they wish to purchase their Host-reserved tickets unconditionally (e.g., regardless of whether any
Invitee accepts the Reservation and purchases one or more tickets), or conditionally (e.g., only if one or more Invitees accepts the Reservation and purchases one or more tickets).  In at least some embodiments, one or more of the GUIs described herein
may be configured or designed to enable the Host to configure or define one or more conditional purchase parameters (e.g., to be satisfied for triggering automatic conditional purchasing of the Host's reserved tickets).
<br/><br/> FIG. 33 illustrates an embodiment of a Reservation Group Event Page GUI 3301 which may be displayed to the Host after confirming the initiation of the Reservation Group.  According to different embodiments, Reservation Group Event Page GUI 3301
may be configured or designed to indicate or provide functionality for one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): Confirmation 3303 that the Host-designated Invitees have been successfully invited to the Reservation Group.  Event details
3330 (e.g., performer/team, date, venue, location, ticket price).  Event media 3332 (e.g., performer/team image, music, video).  Name of the Reservation Group Host.  Event conversation/commenting functionality 3340.  Time remaining to convert reserved
tickets into ticket purchases 3310.  Invitee names 3310.  Invitee reservation acceptance status (attending, declined, yet to reply, maybe) 3310.  The ability for the Host to invite additional Invitees (this functionality may not be enabled for Invitees,
depending on the Host's configuration of the Reservation Group) 3310.  Shareable link 3320 for the Reservation Group event page, such that this link may be posted on social channels (e.g., <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Twitter, etc.), in emails, in SMS messages, etc. for
others to come to the event page and join the Reservation Group.  And/or other types of content/features described and/or referenced herein.
<br/><br/> FIG. 34 illustrates an example scenario (showing selected GUI portions) in which it is assumed that that Host has elected to only reserve 2 tickets for the Reservation Group.  In this example, the Ticket Reservation/Purchasing System need not
require that the Host provide input regarding how many tickets to reserve for the Host vs.  how many to reserve for Invitees, because, in this example scenario, the Host must always reserve at least one ticket for himself.  Accordingly, in some
embodiments one or more portions of the Ticket Reservation Group Invitation process may be omitted, as appropriate.  For example, in the specific example embodiment of FIG. 34, the Host may not be prompted to provide input regarding how many tickets to
reserve for the Host vs.  how many to reserve for Invitees, but may still be prompted by the Ticket Reservation/Purchasing System to provide input regarding whether the Host's reserved ticket is to be purchased conditionally or unconditionally.
<br/><br/> FIG. 35 depicts an overview of one embodiment of various actions or operations which may occur during an Event Ticket Reservation Group process conducted for one or more Reservation Group Invitee(s), which, for example, may include, but are not
limited to, one or more of the following (or combinations thereof): The Invitee receives 3502 a Reservation Group invitation via email or SMS, and clicks the associated invitation link.  The Invitee may view 3504 basic information about the event and the
