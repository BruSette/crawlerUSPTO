       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> Presently described are systems and methods for newsroom management with
     electronic-publish-point integration. One example embodiment takes the
     form of a non-transitory computer-readable medium containing instructions
     that, when executed by a processor, cause a set of steps to be carried
     out for submitting content to an electronic publish point. The set of
     steps includes providing a newsroom script to a user via a user
     interface; receiving a selected portion of an on-air text portion of the
     newsroom script from the user via the user interface; and retrieving,
     from a media database, media associated with the newsroom script. The set
     of steps further includes submitting content to the publish point,
     wherein the content includes text associated with the selected portion of
     the on-air text portion, and wherein the content further includes the
     retrieved media.

<br/><br/>TECHNICAL FIELD
<br/><br/> The present systems and methods relate to broadcasting technology and more particularly to newsroom management and to the creation and submission of content to one or more electronic publish points.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Full service broadcasting systems typically include a series of subsystems that communicate through use of a widely accepted protocol, namely the Video Disk Control Protocol ("VDCP") or the Media Object Server ("MOS") protocol.  One such
subsystem is a video-recording-and-playout server, a common example of which is the K2 server provided by Grass Valley.TM.  of San Francisco, Calif.  Another subsystem is a video-management system such as Bitcentral of Newport Beach, Calif., which
manages a plurality of video-recording-and-playout servers by organizing and moving video components back and forth between the servers and a video-component database (i.e., to store a video component once it is recorded, or to retrieve a video component
for playback).  Video-recording-and-playout servers typically communicate with video-management systems using the VDCP protocol.
<br/><br/> Another subsystem is a newsroom-management system, which joins previously recorded video components (that were, e.g., retrieved by a video-management system) with live video components, graphics, voiceovers, and/or other features or add-ins, to
produce a news program.  An example of a newsroom-management system is the Essential News Production System, a/k/a the Electronic News Program System ("ENPS"), which is leased for use by stations from the Associated Press ("AP").  Newsroom-management
systems typically communicate with video-management systems using the MOS protocol.  A news program is then ultimately selected by a scheduling-and-sequencing subsystem for commercial broadcast (on, e.g., a television channel).
<br/><br/> With the recent popularity of electronic publish points ("publish points") such as those associated with social media services (e.g., Facebook.RTM.  (hereinafter "<b><i>Facebook</i></b>") and Twitter.RTM.  (hereinafter "Twitter")), it has become common to
publicize and solicit interest in a given news program by creating content that relates to the news program, and submitting that content to an associated publish point.  For example, content from or associated with a news program may be used to create
and submit content to a <b><i>Facebook</i></b> page that is associated with that news program (which is then accessible by a user via a website, application, etc.).  That content may also be submitted to other related publish points such as a <b><i>Facebook</i></b> page associated
with a particular media personality that is affiliated with that news program, a Twitter feed for the station on which the news program is broadcast, and/or one or more other options.
<br/><br/> The specific type of content that is submitted to a given publish point typically depends on the configuration of the publish point, but in most instances includes text, hyperlinks, and/or media (such as video components (or embedded code for
video players, applications, etc.) and/or images).  Certain publish points such as those described above often also provide their users with an ability to respond to a publish-point submission, thereby encouraging and facilitating interactive
communication.
<br/><br/> Because it is often desired that content that is submitted to publish points be provided to end users in close temporal proximity to the time when associated content becomes available on other types of media (e.g., on-air broadcast, web videos,
video players and/or applications on connected devices, and the like), or at least that such submissions have a "real-time" feel, content is typically submitted to publish points around the same time that the associated content becomes available (e.g.,
is shown) on the other media.  For example, in the broadcasting industry, it is particularly important that publish-point content about broadcast-news programming appear in close temporal proximity to when the news program airs on television (i.e., to
coincide with a live television broadcast).  This is due in part to the fact that the publish-point content is used to drive interest in the news program through other media.
<br/><br/> Accordingly, a user (e.g., a producer, newsroom social-media director, an otherwise-designated user (hereinafter, collectively referred to as a "producer")) that is affiliated with the provider of that news program typically creates and manually
submits content to various publish points while the news program is being broadcast.  However, this approach presents several issues.  First, news programs are often fast-paced and loaded with content, making it difficult for the producer to keep up with
submitting timely content.  This is particularly an issue when a producer is submitting content to multiple publish points (e.g., multiple pages or feeds associated with one or more social-media services) at substantially the same time.  Further, news
programs are often modified shortly before or even during a broadcast to address timing issues, technical issues, and/or other issues.  As such, a producer's ability to create publish-point content in advance of a news program is limited, due in part to
the practical realities of the ways in which news programming is created and/or the transient time-sensitive nature of the news content itself.
<br/><br/> Another disadvantage of the above-described approach is that the process of creating publish-point content is often tedious and time-consuming.  Indeed, in addition to drafting appropriate text (i.e., text that is associated with the content
that is broadcast in the news program), the producer often needs to search for and retrieve a relevant video component and then include it in the publish-point content.  Obtaining relevant video components in this environment is particularly difficult
due to the fact that traditional broadcasting systems have a segmented design.
<br/><br/> As described above, prior-art newsroom-management systems are not optimized for tight integration with playout servers and/or video-management systems.  As such, when a producer is using such a newsroom-management system (i.e., to view content
that is currently being broadcast or scheduled for broadcast on a news program), and decides to create publish-point content that includes a related video component, the producer must leave the newsroom-management-system environment, access a separate
video-management system (that has access to a video-component database), and search for and retrieve the appropriate video component.  Thereafter, the producer must draft appropriate text, upload the retrieved video component, and submit the content to
the appropriate publish point.  This approach presents similar issues when producers seek to include other relevant media (e.g., images) in their publish-point content, as such media is similarly not available within (nor easily attainable by) that
newsroom-management system.
<br/><br/> Due to the complexity and time required in carrying out the above-described approach, it is common for publish-point content created in this environment to be submitted in an untimely fashion and/or to contain errors.  For example, the submitted
content may include substantive and/or typographical errors in its text, and may also or instead include undesired media (e.g., media that is not relevant to the applicable portion of the news program), mismatched and/or inaccurate media (e.g., media
that contains extra content that is not related to the applicable portion of the news program and/or does not contain relevant content that is intended to be emphasized by the publish-point content), and the like.
<br/><br/> Yet another problem with the above-described approach is that it may present security issues.  In order to enable one or more producers to submit publish-point content, each such person is typically provided with login credentials for a set of
predetermined publish points.  However, because the list of applicable publish points may be large and may frequently change, it can and often does become difficult to manage these login credentials.  As one example, in the event that a producer is
terminated or removed from a news program project, the login credentials for all associated publish points must, in order to prevent unauthorized access, then be changed and provided to all other producers who continue to require such access.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> Disclosed herein are systems and methods for newsroom management with electronic-publish-point integration; the disclosed systems and methods improve upon the traditional approaches to creating and submitting content to an electronic publish
point in a broadcasting environment.

<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> Turning now to FIG. 1, an example newsroom-management system 10 of the present invention is shown.  Included in the newsroom-management system 10 is a publish-point module 12 implemented as a non-transitory computer-readable medium containing
instructions that, when executed by a processor 14, cause performance of a set of steps for creating and submitting content to an electronic publish point 15.  The newsroom-management system 10 further includes an input device 16, a display device 18,
and a user interface 20 provided on the display device through which a user 22 (e.g., a producer) interacts with the publish-point module 12 and the entire newsroom-management system 10.
<br/><br/> Further included in the newsroom-management system 10 is at least one media-management system having a media database.  In at least one embodiment, one media-management system may be a video-management system 24 having one and perhaps a
plurality of recording and playout servers 26 and a video-component database 28, and another media-management system may be an image-management system 30 having an image database 32.  Finally, the newsroom-management system 10 includes a relevancy system
34, a newsroom-script database 36, and a publish-point login-credential database 38.
<br/><br/> It is contemplated that some or all of the above-described systems and databases may be combined and/or otherwise organized as desired.  Also, the organization of data within the described databases is not limited to any one particular
technique.  For example, the video-component database 28 may be organized by storing separate files for each video component.  Alternatively, it may be organized by storing a video file together with a set of markers to identify a video component
contained within the video file.
<br/><br/> Turning now to FIGS. 2A-2D, a flow chart including steps of an example of a method embodiment of the present invention is shown.  In step 200, a newsroom script is provided to a user via the user interface 20 associated with the
newsroom-management system 10.  A newsroom script includes a set of producer commands and/or on-air text, and is associated with a news program, and more particularly, is associated with a block of a news program.  In a typical newsroom-management
system, a news program is represented by a lineup (also referred to as a rundown) that includes a plurality of blocks separated by commercials.  Blocks are identified by letter (e.g., Block A and Block B).  Each block contains a plurality of newsroom
scripts, with each script often being associated with a self-contained news story.  Newsroom scripts are identified by number (e.g., Block A may have Script A-1 and Script A-2).
<br/><br/> The producer commands in each newsroom script are used to assist in the production of the news program (e.g., by specifying the lighting settings).  The on-air text in each newsroom script is typically written by a producer and contains the
actual text that is sent to a teleprompter and intended to be read aloud (e.g., by a news anchor) during a news program (i.e., to correspond to the news story associated with the newsroom script).  Newsroom scripts are stored in the newsroom-script
database 36, and contain references (e.g., pointers) to associated media (e.g., a video component stored in the video-component database 28 or an image stored in the image database 32).
<br/><br/> Next, a user selects a portion of the on-air text included in the newsroom script that is desired to be included in the publish-point content (e.g., by highlighting the text using a mouse or other input device), such that in step 202, a selected
portion (or at least an indication thereof) of the on-air text is received from the user.  In step 204, a menu is provided to the user via the user interface 20 that includes a plurality of selectable publish points 15.  The user then selects one or more
publish points 15 to which the created content will be submitted such that in step 206, one or more selected publish points 15 are received from the user.  In at least one embodiment, a check is also performed to ensure that the selected portion of the
on-air newsroom script does not exceed the maximum number of characters permitted by any selected publish point 15.  In the event that this occurs, a user may be notified and prompted to select another portion of text and/or edit the currently selected
text.  Alternatively, the text may be divided into two or more separate submissions, either automatically or upon a request from the user.  In step 208, a menu is provided to the user with a draft of the content to be submitted to the publish point 15,
including the selected portion of the on-air text.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the provided text may be case corrected (since on-air text is often written in all upper case letters, which may not be desired in content submitted to a publish point 15).  The user can then modify the selected portion of
the on-air text, such that in step 210, a modified version of the selected portion of the on-air text is received from the user.  Depending on the publish point 15, additional options, such as the inclusion of media (e.g., a video component or image) in
the publish-point content may also be provided to the user.  Retrieval of such media is described in greater detail below.
<br/><br/> Among other things, the above-described technique provides an advantage over the traditional approach of creating publish-point content (e.g., by manually typing the text portion), in that it takes advantage of previously written on-air text to
improve the accuracy of the text included in the publish-point content (e.g. the content will have improved accuracy as related to statements actually made on a news program that airs).  Such accuracy, and therefore reliability improves the effectiveness
of publish-point content in creating a connection with an end user (e.g., a consumer of social media).  Due to the intended use of the on-air text (i.e., to literally be read aloud on the air), there is a preexisting need to ensure that the information
contained therein is accurate and relevant to a given news story.  This preexisting need is thereby leveraged to provide added benefits to previously unrelated activities, namely the creation and submission of content to a publish point 15.
<br/><br/> Returning to the additional feature of retrieving media, in the event that a selected publish point 15 provides for the inclusion of video as part of, or in association with, submitted content, the user is given the opportunity to include a
relevant video component as part of the submitted content.  As such, in one embodiment, the video-component database newsroom-management system retrieved media is a video component associated with the newsroom script.  In this embodiment, the
newsroom-management system 10 includes and/or is tightly integrated with the video-management system 24, with each being specially configured to integrate with each other at an operational level such that they provide features that are not available in
traditional newsroom-management systems, and particularly those related to the described publish-point features.  Indeed, since newsroom scripts maintained in the newsroom-script database 36 include references (e.g., a MOS object reference) to video
components in the video-component database 28, an associated video component for a given newsroom script can be retrieved and automatically included in content submitted to a publish point 15.  As such, in step 212, a video component associated with the
selected newsroom script (i.e., the script containing the on-air text selected by the user) is retrieved from the video management database 28.  Moreover, since the video-management system 24 (and therefore the recording and playout server 26) is
integrated into the newsroom-management system 10, in step 214, the retrieved video component can be edited directly in the newsroom-management system 10 (e.g., upon receiving editing requests from a user).  For example, the user could request modifying
the starting and ending positions to select a subset of the full video component before including it in the content for submission to a publish point 15.
<br/><br/> Many publish points 15 also provide for the inclusion of an image as part of, or in association with, the submitted content.  For example, select publish points 15 provide for the inclusion of an image that corresponds to an included video
component (e.g., to be shown to the end user as a preview "icon" for the video component, also commonly known as a thumbnail image).  Again, through tight integration with the video-management system 24, the user is provided with the opportunity to
retrieve still images from the directly accessible video component for use as part of, and/or in association with, the content submitted to the publish point 15.  To assist the user with selecting an image, in step 216, the user is provided with a
preview of the video component and a frame marker via the user interface 20.  In step 218, a position of the frame marker is adjusted based upon a request received from the user, and in step 220, an image of the video component is defined based on a
frame associated with the frame marker.
<br/><br/> The user may be further provided with options to move forward or backward some predefined number of frames to provide greater ease and more intuitive frame navigation.  In at least one embodiment, the user has the option to move inclusively
between 1-60, between 30-120, and between 60-9,000 frames per movement, and more particularly, the user may have the option to move 1, 30, or 1,800 frames per movement (notably, for video having a 30 frames per second frame rate, 30 frames represent 1
second of video and 1,800 frames represent 1 minute of video), with incrementally displaced frames being loaded from the video-component database each time the frame marker is moved (to reduce memory-retrieval time).  However, these frame movement
settings may be adjusted as desired (e.g., proportionally scaled for different frame rates).
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, a default image for an associated video component may also be selected (e.g., based on the first frame of the associated video component).  It may also be the case that the user is allowed to select from a list of generic
images (e.g., when no video associated with the news story exists) or from another available source.  As such, in one embodiment, the newsroom-management system 10, and the retrieved media is an image associated with the newsroom script.  Similar to the
steps described above with respect to retrieval of an associated video component, in step 222, an image associated with the newsroom script is retrieved from the image database 32.
<br/><br/> It should be noted that in some embodiments, a user may retrieve a video component associated with the newsroom script simply to obtain an associated image (i.e., by using the frame selection technique described above), but may not include the
video component itself in the content submitted to the publish point.  Likewise, an image may be selected that is not associated with a particular video component, but that is otherwise desired to be included in the content submitted to the publish
point.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, a user is provided with the opportunity to obtain publish-point content (e.g., an image, video or other media) from another source such as an email, website, database, etc., and is provided with a path destination window
in which the user can select the media in the appropriate location.
<br/><br/> Publish-point content may also be retrieved through use of a relevancy system.  Using this technique, in step 224, a subset of the selected portion of the associated newsroom script is sent to the relevancy subsystem 34, and in step 226, media
resulting from a search based on the subset of the selected portion of the on-air text is retrieved from a media database (which may be external, but accessible to the relevancy subsystem 34).  In some embodiments, the subset of the selected portion of
the on-air text is the entire selected portion.  However, in other embodiment, filters may be applied to remove certain text (e.g., terms such as "a" and "the") from the selected portion before sending the request to the relevancy subsystem.  In
utilizing this technique, by a user's mere selection of a portion of an on-air text portion of a newsroom script, the relevancy system 34 returns a set of video components, images, or other media that can be selected by a user and included in the content
submitted to a publish point.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the publish-point content may include media associated with a newsroom script (e.g., based on a MOS object reference or on search results obtained from the relevancy system 34), but not an on-air text portion of the
newsroom script.  This allows a user to select a newsroom script generally (e.g., Script A) instead of selecting a portion of the associated on-air text, to create relevant publish-point content.  In yet another embodiment, a selection of on-air text may
be used solely to identify media sought to be submitted to a publish point.  These embodiments allow a user to skip the step of modifying a selected portion of on-air text, thereby further streamlining the process of submitting content to a publish point
15 (i.e., without a text portion).
<br/><br/> In step 228, the user's request to submit the content as configured to a publish point 15 is received, in step 230, login credentials for each of the selected publish points are retrieved from the login credential database 38, and in step 232,
the publish-point content is submitted to each selected publish point 15 using the retrieved corresponding login credentials.  Use of such login credentials is particularly beneficial when users are submitting content to multiple publish points as
individual users need not be given login credentials for each publish point.  In some embodiments, login credentials may also include particular data required by the corresponding publish point 15 to permit for automatic submissions (i.e., by reducing or
eliminating user intervention as described below).
<br/><br/> The newsroom-management system 10 may also be configured such that it requires a master login to prevent unauthorized access to the associated publish points.  Also, in submitting content to each publish point, an appropriate protocol such as an
application programming interface is retrieved (e.g., from the login credential database 38) and followed such that the content can be submitted.
<br/><br/> Typically, the protocol for a publish point 15 defines certain restrictions, such as what types of content can be submitted.  Such restrictions may be leveraged to assist the user in selecting content for submission.  For example, if one of the
selected publish points does not accept video submissions, the user may be notified of the same and is restricted from selecting video (such as by disabling the option in the user interface 20).
<br/><br/> In an alternative embodiment, a given newsroom script is associated with predefined publish-point content (e.g., defined at the time the newsroom script is created) and is tagged for auto-publishing.  This technique is used to reduce or
eliminate user intervention at or around the time the content is intended to be submitted to a publish point.  For example, as a producer is drafting an on-air text portion of a newsroom script, the producer may select associated content (e.g., a portion
of the on-air text portion or media associated with the newsroom script), designate it as appropriate content for submission to a publish point, and tag the newsroom script for auto-publishing.  Thereafter, as the news program airs, the predefined
content associated with the appropriate newsroom script is automatically submitted to the publish point.  Preferably, the time at which the on-air text of the newsroom script is sent to a teleprompter is used to trigger the automatic submission of
content to the publish point, but other timing mechanisms are also considered as triggering events (e.g., a timer alert).
<br/><br/> It should further be noted that each of the content selection and login credential features discussed throughout this application are still applicable to this alternative embodiment.  As such, the producer may predefine video, images, or other
content (or rely on media obtained from the relevancy system 34) for automatic submission to one or more publish points using appropriate protocols and login credentials.  Using this technique, select user intervention can be further reduced or
eliminated, thereby providing an even greater ability to efficiently and accurately create and submit publish-point content that is relevant to an associated news program.
<br/><br/> Notably, the present system and method may also be used in connection with a news program that is aired on the radio.  In such embodiments, the newsroom script contains on-air text that is intended to be read aloud by a radio broadcaster during
a news program and therefore the above-described techniques can be similarly applied.  Notably, while a newsroom script that is used for radio does not contain a link or reference to a particular video component (since video is not supported by a radio
broadcast), video components may still be obtained such as via use of the relevancy system 34 as described above.
<br/><br/> It is noted that the described steps throughout this application need not be performed in the disclosed order.  Further, the steps need not be performed sequentially, but can also be performed in parallel as desired.  Further, not all steps need
to be performed to achieve the desired goals of the present invention, and therefore not all steps are required.
<br/><br/> Throughout this application, in some instances, steps may be defined by activity of the user.  In these instances, such described steps should also be interpreted as describing the computer-readable medium and/or system hardware components as
containing instructions that, when executed, take appropriate steps or provide appropriate output requesting the user to perform such steps and/or instructions for receiving the user's input and proceeding accordingly.
<br/><br/> Although the present invention has been described in terms of certain embodiments and generally associated methods, alterations, combinations, and permutations of these embodiments and methods will be apparent to those skilled in the art. 
Accordingly, the above description of example embodiments does not define or constrain the present invention.
<br/><br/> Other changes, substitutions, and alterations are also possible without departing from the invention in its broader aspects as set forth in the following claims.
