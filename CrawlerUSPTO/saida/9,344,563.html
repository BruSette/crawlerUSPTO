       <br/><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
       <p> Systems and methods for recycling contact numbers are presented. A
     service provider receives a disconnect request for a device associated
     with a contact number. The system retrieves and stores the device's
     contact list and/or communication history. One or more messages are
     created and stored. The contact number is placed in a pool of recycled
     numbers and mapped to the stored information, and may later be assigned
     to a second device. Subsequently, when a call is made over the service
     provider's network, the called number is compared with numbers in the
     pool. If a match is found, the system retrieves the stored contact list
     and/or communication history, and compares the calling number to numbers
     in the contact list and/or communication history. If a match is found,
     the system retrieves and plays the message to inform the calling party
     that the number they are trying to reach has been re-assigned.

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>BACKGROUND INFORMATION
<br/><br/> When a customer of a service provider of telephony services disconnects from that service, the telephone number or numbers associated with that customer's account (such as mobile and/or landline phone numbers) may be "recycled" and reassigned to
other customers of the service provider (either new customers or existing customers that sign up for additional lines).  However, the old customer may forget to inform family, friends, businesses, or other third parties in possession of the telephone
number that he no longer uses that number.  Accordingly, the customer that has been assigned the old customer's recycled number may receive unwanted calls from individuals and entities trying to reach the old customer.  This may lead to bad user
experiences, both for the customer associated with the reassigned number, and for those who call the reassigned number, expecting to reach the old customer.
<br/><br/> These and other drawbacks exist. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<br/><br/> The present invention, together with further objects and advantages, may best be understood by reference to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in the several figures of which like reference numerals
identify like elements, and in which:
<br/><br/> FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a system according to a particular embodiment;
<br/><br/> FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of a hardware component of the system of a particular embodiment;
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a method of a particular embodiment; and
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a method of a particular embodiment.
<br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<br/><br/> A system and method may include various embodiments for recycling contact numbers that were previously associated with customers.  A customer of a service provider may want to switch carriers, switch numbers within the same carrier, and/or
disconnect his phone service.  The customer may contact the current service provider to have his service disconnected or phone number changed.  The service provider may recycle the customer's number by placing it back into a pool of available numbers. 
One or more computer processors may be configured to retrieve a communication history of all communications that have either been placed to the disconnected number or made by the disconnected number over a certain time period.  The computer processors
may map the numbers in the communication history to the disconnected number in the pool of available numbers.
<br/><br/> The one or more computer processors may be to configured allow the old customer to create a personalized message.  The personalized message may be an audio, video, and/or text message configured to inform the recipient that the number they are
trying to reach is no longer associated with the old customer.  The personalized message may be mapped to the disconnected number in the pool of available numbers.  The disconnected number may be assigned to a different customer.  Subsequently, a friend
or associate of the old customer may place a call to the number that has been assigned to the different customer--for example, if the old customer has not notified friends and associates about the number change.
<br/><br/> The call may be routed to a system that determines that the called number has been recycled.  The system may retrieve the list of numbers in the communication history that have been mapped to the recycled number and compare the numbers in the
communication history to the calling number.  If there is a match, the system may play the personalized message for the calling party.  The personalized message may contain one or more instructions for the calling party, informing them how to reach the
person they are trying to call.  The calling party may then choose whether to continue with the call and be connected to the new customer.  In this way, friends and associates of the previous customer intending to contact the previous customer may learn
that the number is currently being used by a new customer, without disturbing the new customer and thereby maintaining the brand value of the service provider.
<br/><br/> The description below describes communication modules, personalized messaging modules, routing modules, recycled numbers modules, user devices, service portals, service providers, computer systems, and networks that may include one or more
modules, some of which are explicitly shown while others are not.  As used herein, the term "module" may be understood to refer to computing software, firmware, hardware, and/or various combinations thereof.  It is noted that the modules are examples. 
The modules may be combined, integrated, separated, and/or duplicated to support various applications.  Also, a function described herein as being performed at a particular module may be performed at one or more other modules and/or by one or more other
devices instead of or in addition to the function performed at the particular module.  Further, the modules may be implemented across multiple devices and/or other components local or remote to one another.  Additionally, the modules may be moved from
one device and added to another device, and/or may be included in both devices.
<br/><br/> It is further noted that software described herein may be tangibly embodied in one or more physical media, such as, but not limited to, a compact disc ("CD"), a digital versatile disc ("DVD"), a floppy disk, a hard drive, read only memory
("ROM"), random access memory ("RAM"), as well as other physical media capable of storing software, and/or combinations thereof.  The functions described as being performed at various components may be performed at other components, and the various
components may be combined and/or separated.  Other modifications also may be made.

be coupled to or integrated with switching system 210 or service provider 200.  For example, modules 202, 204, 206, and 208 may be external devices that are wirelessly coupled and/or communicatively coupled to switching system 210 via an interface port
which may include, without limitation, USB ports, system bus ports, or Firewire ports and other interface ports.  Further, computer code may be installed on switching system 210 to control and/or operate a function of communication module 202,
personalized messaging module 204, routing module 206, and/or recycled numbers module 208.
<br/><br/> It is well known that users may want to switch service providers for various reasons, such as to obtain cheaper or better service.  Users may want to switch numbers within a service provider.  When a user changes service providers or moves to a
different geographic area, the user device's unique identifier, such as a telephone number, may be "recycled" by the user's old service provider and assigned to a different user.  However, the new user with the recycled number may still receive calls or
other communications from individuals trying to contact the old user.
<br/><br/> As depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, the user associated with user device 101, for example, may want to disconnect his service, and/or switch service providers and receive a new telephone number for user device 101.  For example, number (123) 456-7890
may be in the address space belonging to service provider 200 and may have been given out to the user associated with user device 101 by service provider 200.  The user associated with user device 101 may notify service provider 200 that he wishes to
disconnect or change his service.  The user may access one or more websites provided by service provider 200 for disconnecting or canceling his service.  When service provider 200 determines that user device 101 wishes to disconnect his service, service
provider 200 may connect user device 101 to switching system 210.
<br/><br/> Communication module 202 of switching system 210 may provide one or more graphical user interfaces for the user associated with user device 101.  Communication module 202 may interact with user device 101 via one or more websites hosted by
service provider 200 and/or switching system 210.  Communication module 202 may prompt user device 101 for the number associated with user device 101.  User device 101 may provide the number--(123) 456-7890.  Communication module 202 may transmit the
number to recycled numbers module 208.  Recycled numbers module 208 may store the number in a pool of recycled numbers, and flag it as a recycled number.  As used herein, the term "recycled number" means a contact number from a service provider that was
previously associated with a customer of the service provider, but is no longer associated with that customer.
<br/><br/> Each number in the pool of recycled numbers may be stored there for a period of time.  The period of time may depend on the number.  The user previously associated with the recycled number may designate the period of time that the recycled
number will be stored in the pool.  The service provider may designate the period of time.  The period of time may be 1 year.  After the period of time expires, the recycled number may be removed from the recycled number pool.
<br/><br/> Communication module 202 may request that user device 101 upload its contact list.  The user associated with user device 101 may have a contact list or address list of phone numbers and/or email addresses stored on user device 101, or stored on
an external device.  User device 101 may upload the address list or contact list to communication module 202.  The address list or contact list may be uploaded as one or more files.  Communication module 202 may store the address list or contact list in
data storage 120.  Recycled numbers module 208 and/or communications module 202 may map the recycled number stored in the pool to the address list or contact list stored in data storage 120.  "Mapping the recycled number" may mean storing one or more
pointers with the recycled number, wherein the pointers point to locations in data storage 120 where the corresponding contact list is stored.  In other embodiments, the user associated with user device 101 may provide a contact list from one or more
social networking sites where the user has an account or profile.  Non-limiting examples of social networking sites include <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Google+, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Flickr.
<br/><br/> In another exemplary embodiment, the user associated with user device 101 may choose not to upload his contact list to communication module 202--for example, if a user does not want to provide a contact list for privacy reasons.  Communication
module 202 may retrieve a communication history for the recycled number automatically from service provider 200.  The communication history may comprise a list of all communications that the user device 101 has made and/or received over a certain time
period.  A communication may be a phone call, a text message, SMS, MMS, or other similar form of communication.  The communication history may include the contact number associated with the source and/or recipient of each communication.  The
communication history may include the email address or IP address associated with the source and/or recipient of each communication (for example, if a call was made to user device 101 using a Voice over IP (VOIP) equipped phone or computer).  The
communication history may include a date and time associated with each communication.
<br/><br/> The user associated with user device 101 may specify the period of time that the communication history should cover.  Communication module 202 may retrieve the communication history for the recycled number spanning the specified period of time. 
Communication module 202 may be programmed to automatically retrieve user device 101's communication history for the past month, past three months, past six months, year, or other period of time.  Communication module 202 may retrieve user device 101's
communication history even if user device 101 chooses to upload a contact list.
<br/><br/> In other embodiments, communication module 202 may allow the user to specify the period of time based on the type of communication.  For example, communication module may retrieve the communication history for all text messages sent to or from
user device 101 from the past 3 months, while retrieving the communication history for all calls made to or from user device 101 for the past 6 months.
<br/><br/> Communication module 202 may store the retrieved communication history in data storage 120.  Recycled numbers module 208 and/or communications module 202 may map the recycled number (previously associated with user device 101) to the
communication history stored in data storage 120.
<br/><br/> Personalized messaging module 204 may be configured to create one or more personalized messages for the user associated with user device 101.  Communication module 202 may provide one or more graphical user interfaces for user device 101 to
customize a personalized message.  The personalized message may be an audio recording, created by the user associated with user device 101.  The personalized message may be a video recording.  The personalized message may be designed to play back on a
user device, such as user device 102, user device 116, or user device 118.  The personalized message may be a text-based message.  The personalized message may inform a calling party that the user associated with the recycled number no longer uses that
number.  The personalized message may include a description of a new telephone number for the user associated with user device 101.  The personalized message may state the name of the customer that has been assigned the recycled number.
<br/><br/> Personalized messaging module 204 may automatically create one or more default messages.  The user associated with user device 101 may be allowed to select one or more default messages using communication module 202.  One default message may be
a voice message that states "The number you are attempting to call is no longer assigned to `X`.  It is now being used by `Y`.  If you are attempting to reach Y, please stay on the line." "X" may be the name of the user associated with user device 101. 
"Y" may be the name of the user who has been assigned the recycled number previously associated with user device 101.  In other embodiments, the recycled number previously associated with user device 101 may not have been reassigned.  In this case, the
personalized message may simply state that the recycled number is no longer associated with user device 101.  In other embodiments, the new user of the recycled number may not wish to be identified, and the default message may simply state that the
number has been reassigned.
<br/><br/> Personalized messaging module 204 may include several options in the personalized message and/or default message, requesting a response from the calling party.  Personalized messaging module 204 may create a message that informs the calling
party that the user associated with user device 101 no longer uses the called number.  For example, the personalized message may then request the calling party "press 1" to continue the call and be connected to the new customer that is now using the
recycled number.  To select the desired call option, the calling party may use a key on a keypad (e.g., depress a key, scroll a wheel, etc.), may use a button on a side of the user device, may speak a selection, may use a motion (e.g., the calling user
device may include a gyroscope or other motion detector to detect when the calling party moves the calling device a certain angle, or shakes, swings, maneuvers, and/or otherwise moves the calling device, etc.), or may use other manners of selecting
between the different call options.
<br/><br/> Personalized messaging module 204 may store the one or more personalized messages or default messages in data storage 120 and map them to the recycled number in the pool at recycled numbers module 208.  Personalized messaging module 204 may
associate an expiration date and/or time with each of the personalized messages or default messages.  For example, the personalized message may only be valid for the next three months.  At the end of the expiration date and/or time, the personalized
messaging module 204 may delete the personalized message from data storage 120.  The user associated with user device 101 may set an expiration date and/or time independently for each personalized message.
<br/><br/> The user associated with user device 101 may record multiple messages or select multiple default messages and assign them to different numbers in user device 101's contact list.  For example, user device 101 may record one message to be played
for calls received from family members, and a different message to be played for calls received from co-workers.  The user associated with user device 101 may assign different messages to be played based on the number of calls received from the user's
contact list and/or communication history after the user's number is recycled.  For example, personalized messaging module 204 may store message A with a counter indicating that message A is to be played for the first 10 calls made to the number
previously associated with user device 101 (if those calls originate from a number in the communication history or contact list for user device 101).  Once 10 calls have been received, messaging module 204 may delete message A. Messaging module 204 may
store message B indicating that message B is to be played for the next 10 calls received for the number previously associated with user device 101.  In other non-limiting embodiments, message A may be played for the first 30 days after the number
associated with user agent 101 is recycled, while message B may be played for the next 30 days after message A expires.  In other embodiments, the number of calls and/or time period for each message may be dependent on the type of communication and/or
the relationship between the sender/caller and receiver/callee (e.g., friends or contacts may receive the message for shorter amount of time than business connections).
<br/><br/> Personalized message module 204 or the user associated with user device 101 may assign different personalized or default messages to be played depending on the type of communication received.  In one embodiment, one personalized message may be
designated to respond to phone calls, another may be selected to respond to text messages.
<br/><br/> Personalized messaging module 204 may store the one or more personalized messages and/or default messages in data storage 120 and map them to the recycled number in the pool associated with recycled numbers module 208.  Recycled numbers module
208 may be configured to assign the one or more recycled numbers to a new user device.  For example, the user associated with user device 116 may request a new number or new line from service provider 200.  Service provider 200 may communicate with
recycled numbers module 208 and assign a number stored in the pool of recycled numbers to user device 116.  When a recycled number is assigned to a new user device, recycled numbers module 208 may retrieve data associated with the new user from service
provider 200.  Recycled numbers module 208 may retrieve the user's name, email address, address, and other contact information associated with the new user of the recycled number.  Recycled numbers module 208 may update the one or more personalized
messages stored in data storage 120 (that were mapped to the recycled number) to include the name of the user associated with user device 116 (i.e., the user device that has been assigned the recycled number).  For example, recycled numbers module 208
may update the stored personalized messages and/or default messages to include a voice recording stating that "the number you are calling has been assigned to [the user associated with user device 116].  If you would like to continue, please press `1` or
stay on the line."
<br/><br/> Routing module 206 may receive communication information associated with a communication made to a recycled number, compare the calling party's number to the communication history and/or contact list associated with the recycled number, and play
back one or more personalized messages or default messages based on the comparison.  For example, user device 101 may have disconnected service from service provider 200.  The telephone number associated with user device 101 may have been placed in the
recycled numbers pool associated with recycled numbers module 208.  The user associated with user device 101 may have created one or more personalized messages and personalized messaging module 204 may have stored them in data storage 120 and mapped them
to the recycled number.  The user associated with user device 101 may have provided one or more contact lists to communication module 202, which may have stored them in data storage 120 and mapped them to the recycled number.  Communication module 202
may have retrieved user device 101's communication history from service provider 200, stored the communication history in data storage 120, and mapped the communication history to the recycled number in the recycled numbers pool associated with recycled
numbers module 208.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, the user associated with user device 101 may have provided personalized message module 204 with their new contact number.  In this case, the message may include the user's new contact number.
<br/><br/> The user associated with user device 116 may request service from service provider 200.  Service provider 200 may assign the recycled number (previously associated with user device 101) to user device 116.  In one example, the user associated
with user device 102 may be an acquaintance of the user associated with user device 101.  The telephone number for user device 102 may be one of the numbers in the communication history or contact list that was previously associated with user device 101.
<br/><br/> The user associated with user device 102 may dial the number previously associated with user device 101.  In this example, assume the recycled number (previously associated with user device 101) is (123) 456-7890.  This number may have been
assigned to user device 116 (unbeknownst to the user associated with user device 102).
<br/><br/> Service portal 106 may direct the call from user device 102 to network 108.  Routing module 206 may receive the communication information for the call, which may include the called number (123) 456-7890.  The communication information may
include the telephone number associated with user device 102 (the calling party).  Routing module 206 may temporarily interrupt the normal call flow and provide the communication information to recycled numbers module 208.  Recycled numbers module 208
may compare the called number to one or more numbers in the pool of recycled numbers.  Recycled numbers module 208 may determine that the called number matches one of the numbers in the pool of recycled numbers.  In other examples, if no match is found
between the called number and the pool of recycled numbers, routing module 206 may direct the call to user device 116 via network 108 and service portal 112.
<br/><br/> Recycled numbers module 208 may determine that the called number (123) 456-7890 matches a number in the pool of recycled numbers.  Recycled numbers module 208 may signal routing module 206 that the called number matches a recycled number. 
Routing module 206 may provide the called number to data storage 120.  Routing module 206 may use the called number to retrieve the information that has been mapped to the recycled number (the called number) in data storage 120.  The mapped information
may include a contact list, a communication history, and/or one or more personalized messages or default messages.  Routing module may retrieve the contact list and/or the communication history.  Routing module 206 may compare the calling number to the
numbers found in the communication history and the contact list.
<br/><br/> Continuing with the previous example, assume that user device 102 had previously called user device 101 while the (now) recycled number was still associated with user device 101 (i.e., before user device 101 had disconnected from service
provider 200).  User device 102's number may be included in the communication history for user device 101, which would have been received by communication module 202 and mapped to the recycled number when user device 101 disconnected or ended his service
with service provider 200 (as described above).  Thus, when routing module 206 compares the numbers in the communication history to the calling number of user device 102, routing module 206 may find a match.  Based on this match, routing module 206 may
retrieve one or more personalized messages or default messages stored in database 120 that have been mapped to the called number ((123) 456-7890).  Routing module 206 may play, transmit, and/or stream the one or more personalized messages or default
messages for playback to user device 102.  Routing module 206 may select the personalized message and/or default message based on the calling number of user device 102, the date and time of the call, the expiration date and time associated with the
personalized message and/or default message, the type of communication (call, text, SMS, etc.) and other factors as described above.
<br/><br/> The personalized message may be an audio recording, a video recording, a text message, or a combination of the above.  The personalized message may be provided to user device 102.  The personalized message may be streamed to user device 102 over
network 108 from messaging module 204.  The personalized message may be provided to user device 102 in the same way an audio voicemail is provided.  The personalized message may be downloaded onto user device 102, which may play the message for the user. The personalized message may inform user device 102 that user device 101 is no longer associated with the called number.  The personalized message may information user device 102 that user device 116 is now associated with the called number.  The
personalized message may provide user device 102 with user device 101's new contact number.  The personalized message may solicit a response from user device 102, such as whether user device 102 wishes to continue the call and connect with user device
116.
<br/><br/> The user associated with user device 102 may respond by pressing one or more keys on a keypad associated with user device 102.  The response may be a vocal confirmation from the user associated with user device 102 that he wishes to proceed with
the call.  The response may be a vocal indication from the user associated with user device 102 that he does not wish to proceed with the call.  Routing module 206 may receive the response from user device 102.  In other embodiments, if no response is
received after a predetermined period of time, routing module 206 may automatically route the call to user device 116.  In other embodiments, if no response is received after a predetermined time (e.g., 30 seconds), routing module may stop the call from
being routed to user device 116.
<br/><br/> Routing module 206 may route the call from user device 102 to user device 116 depending on the response from user device 102.  For example, if user device 102 responds in a way that indicates that the user associated with user device 102 wishes
to proceed with the call, routing module 206 may provide routing information to service provider 200, service portal 112, network 108, or other routing devices in order to connect user device 102's call with user device 116.  If user device 102 responds
in a way that indicates that the user associated with user device 102 does not wish to proceed with the call, routing module 206 may end the call (i.e., by not routing the call to user device 116).  In this way, calls to user device 116 may be screened
for callers who may be trying to contact user device 101.
<br/><br/> In some embodiments, if the user associated with user device 101 previously provided personalized message module 204 with their new contact number, routing module 206 may route the call to the user associated with user device 101's new contact
number.  In this case, the message may solicit a response, such as "if you would like to be connected to [user associated with user device 101]'s new number, please press 2." If user device 102 selects this option, routing module 206 may route the call
to user device 101's new number.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the user associated with user device 102 may send a text message to the number previously associated with user device 101 ((123) 456-7890).  As in the previous example, assume the recycled number (previously associated
with user device 101) has been assigned to user device 116 (unbeknownst to the user associated with user device 102).  As before, service portal 106 may direct the text message from user device 102 to network 108.  Routing module 206 may receive the
communication information, which may include the text message recipient number (123) 456-7890.  The communication information may include the telephone number associated with user device 102 (the texting party).  Routing module 206 may provide the
communication information to recycled numbers module 208.  Recycled numbers module 208 may compare the text message recipient number to the pool of recycled numbers.  Recycled numbers module 208 may determine that the texted number matches one of the
numbers in the pool of recycled numbers.  In other examples, if no match is found, routing module 206 may direct the text message to user device 116 via network 108 and service portal 112.
<br/><br/> Recycled numbers module 208 may determine that the texted number (123) 456-7890 matches a number in the pool of recycled numbers.  Recycled numbers module 208 may signal routing module 206 that the texted number matches a recycled number. 
Routing module 206 may provide the texted number to data storage 120.  Routing module 206 may use the texted number to retrieve the information that has been mapped to the recycled number (the texted number) in data storage 120--as described above. 
Routing module may retrieve the contact list and/or the communication history.  Routing module 206 may compare the number associated with user device 102 to the numbers found in the communication history and/or the contact list.
<br/><br/> Continuing with the previous example, assume that user device 102 had previously called or texted user device 101 while the (now) recycled number was still associated with user device 101 (i.e., before user device 101 had disconnected from
service provider 200).  User device 102's number may be included in the communication history for user device 101, which would have been retrieved by communication module 202 and mapped to the recycled number when user device 101 disconnected or ended
his service with service provider 200 (as described above).  Thus, when routing module 206 compares the numbers in the communication history to the number of user device 102, routing module 206 may find a match.  Based on this match, routing module 206
may retrieve one or more personalized messages or default messages stored in database 120 that have been mapped to the texted number ((123) 456-7890).
<br/><br/> Routing module 206 may play, transmit, and/or stream the one or more personalized messages or default messages for playback to user device 102.  Routing module 206 may select the personalized message and/or default message based on the number of
user device 102, the date and time of the text message, the expiration date and time associated with the personalized message and/or default message, the type of communication (call, text, SMS, etc.) and other factors as described above.
<br/><br/> The personalized message may be an audio recording, a video recording, a text message, or a combination of the above.  The personalized message may be played for user device 102.  The personalized message may be streamed to user device 102.  The
personalized message may be played on user device 102.  The personalized message may inform user device 102 that user device 101 is no longer associated with the texted number.  The personalized message may information user device 102 that user device
116 is now associated with the texted number.  The personalized message may provide user device 102 with user device 101's new contact number.  The personalized message may solicit a response from user device 102, such as whether user device 102 wishes
to continue the call and connect with user device 116.
<br/><br/> The user associated with user device 102 may respond by pressing one or more keys on a keypad associated with user device 102.  The response may be a vocal confirmation from the user associated with user device 102 that he would like the text
message to be transmitted to user device 116.  The response may be a vocal indication from the user associated with user device 102 that he does not wish for the text message to be communicated to user device 116.  Routing module 206 may receive the
response from user device 102.  In other embodiments, if no response is received after a predetermined period of time, routing module 206 may automatically transmit the text message to user device 116.  In other embodiments, if no response is received
after a predetermined time (e.g., 30 seconds), routing module may block the text message from being routed to user device 116, and inform user device 102 of this.
<br/><br/> Routing module 206 may transmit the text message from user device 102 to user device 116 depending on the response from user device 102.  For example, if user device 102 responds in a way that indicates that the user associated with user device
102 wants the text message to be transmitted, routing module 206 may provide routing information to service provider 200, service portal 112, network 108, or other routing devices in order to transmit the text message to user device 116.  If user device
102 responds in a way that indicates that the user associated with user device 102 does not want the text message to be transmitted, routing module 206 may block transmission.  In this way, calls to user device 116 may be screened for text messages that
may be intended for user device 101.
<br/><br/> In some exemplary embodiments, switching system 210 may include one or more override features.  For example, in one exemplary embodiment, the new user associated with a recycled number (such as the user associated with user device 116 from the
previous example) may provide his contact list to switching system 210 when user device 116 is assigned the recycled number (that was once assigned to user device 101).  This process may be similar to how the user associated with user device 101 uploaded
his contact list to switching system 210, as described previously.  Subsequently, when a call is placed to the recycled number (now associated with user device 1116), routing module 206 may initially compare the communication information to the entries
in user device 116's contact list (after determining that the called number is in the recycled numbers pool).  If there is a match, routing module 206 may automatically route the call to user device 116 and bypass the other steps in switching system 210
(thus not playing or transmitting a personalized or default message).  This would be helpful in situations where the user of user device 116 has one or more contacts in common with the user of user device 101, such as where the users are relatives or
acquaintances.
<br/><br/> In another embodiment, the users associated with user devices 101 and 116 may not own their respective devices (such as where the devices are company issued phones or computers).  A third party, such as an employer may own the user devices. 
When a number is recycled and re-assigned from user device 101 to user device 116, the third party may have the option of overriding the features of switching system 210, create personalized messages to be played back or transmitted as described above,
limit the contact numbers that can contact user device 116, and perform all the other functions performed by the user associated with user device 101 or user device 116.
<br/><br/> In one exemplary embodiment, routing module 206 may keep track of the number of times a certain number has been used to call or text a recycled number, and set a limit on how many times the routing module will retrieve a personalized or default
message to be played back or transmitted to the calling user device.  For example, if the same user device continues to call a number even after it has been recycled (and the calling number matches with one of the numbers in the communication history
and/or contact list mapped to the recycled number), routing module 206 may increment a counter each time it receives a communication from the calling number.  Once the counter reaches a predetermined threshold value, routing module 206 simply route the
call, without retrieving any personalized message or default message.  In other embodiments, routing module 206 may prevent the communication from being routed.  If the threshold value is 10, then the routing module 206 may not connect the eleventh call
from a user device to a recycled number.  The threshold value may be set by the routing module 206, the user associated with the recycled number, service provider 200, or some other entity.
<br/><br/> FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating the functionality of a particular embodiment.  This method is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out the methods described herein.  Method 300 shown in FIG. 3 may be executed or
otherwise performed by one or a combination of various systems.  The method 300 may be carried out through system 100 of FIG. 1 and/or the one or more modules shown in FIG. 2, by way of example, and various elements of FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 are referenced in
explaining method 300 of FIG. 3.  Each block shown in FIG. 3 represents one or more processes, methods, or subroutines carried out in method 300.  Method 300 may begin at block 302.
<br/><br/> At block 302, method 300 may receive a disconnection request.  The disconnection request may be received from a user device associated with a user subscribing to telephony services from a service provider (such as service provider 200 in FIG.
1).  Service provider 200 may provide one or interactive websites where a user may submit a disconnection request.  The disconnection request may include a request to disconnect a user device from the service provider's network, or receive a different
telephone number.  The user device (such as user device 101) may provide its current number that will be recycled.  In one example, a user named Joe Smith may submit a disconnect request to his telephone service provider.  Joe Smith may have a mobile
phone that has been assigned the number (987) 654-3210 by the service provider.  Joe Smith may submit a disconnect request that includes this number.  Method 300 may proceed to block 304.
<br/><br/> At block 304, in response to receiving a disconnection request, method 300 may create one or more personalized messages.  The personalized message may Joe Smith.  If Joe Smith decides not to create a personalized message, the personalized
message module 204 may select one or more default messages.  The personalized messages and/or default messages may be an audio message, a video message, and/or a text message for playback to a user device.  The personalized message may be recorded by a
user (such as the user associated with user device 101) and uploaded to switching system 210 from the mobile phone in response to an indication at the mobile phone that the personalized message or messages have been finished.  The personalized message or
messages may be created by the user using an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system provided by the user's service provider.  The user may create the personalized message or messages using an online interface provided by the service provider. 
Continuing with the previous example, Joe Smith may submit a disconnect request.  Joe Smith may record the following personalized message on his mobile phone: "Hi, this is Joe Smith.  I no longer use this number.  I can now be reached at .  . . " Joe
Smith may include a new contact number, email address, web address, etc. where he can be reached in the personalized message.
<br/><br/> Switching system 210 and/or Service provider 200 may include interactive information in the personalized message.  For example, personalized message module 204 may include the following information in Joe Smith's personalized message: "If you
wish to proceed with this call, please press 1.  Otherwise, please hang up." The personalized message may solicit one or more responses from a calling party (as will be described in connection with FIG. 4).  The personalized message may be stored in data
storage 120.  Personalized message module 204 may do the same for default messages.  The default message may state "The number you are trying to reach has been reassigned to another customer.  If you would like to continue with this call, please press 1
or say `Continue`".  Method 300 may proceed to block 306.
<br/><br/> At block 306, method 300 may receive the user device's contact list following the creation of the one or more personalized messages and/or default messages.  Continuing with the previous example, Joe Smith may supply the contact list stored on
his smart phone to switching system 210 and/or service provider 200.  Communication module 202 may provide one or more graphical user interfaces where Joe Smith can upload the contact list stored on smartphone, or on an external device.  The contact list
may include the names, phone numbers, email addresses, and other information associated with one or more individuals associated with Joe Smith.  The contact list may be stored in data storage 120.  Method 300 may proceed to block 308.
<br/><br/> At block 308, method 300 may retrieve the user device's communication history.  The communication history may be supplied by service provider 200.  The communication history may be supplied by a third party.  The communication history may
comprise a list of all calls that have been made to or from the user device associated with the user who submitted the disconnect request.  The communication history may comprise a list of all text messages that have been sent or received by Joe Smith's
smartphone.  The communication history may span a certain time period.  Joe Smith may select the time period.  Switching system 210 may determine the time period.  Continuing with the previous example, communication module 202 may retrieve the
communication history associated with Joe Smith's telephone number (987) 654-3210.  The communication history may include a list of each phone number that Joe Smith has called using his smart phone over the past three months.  The communication history
may further include a list of each phone number that has called Joe Smith in the last three months.  The communication history may include a list of each phone number that has sent Joe Smith's phone a text message, SMS message, MMS message, or other
text-based message.  The communication history may include a list of each phone number that Joe Smith has sent a text message to (or SMS/MMS message, etc.).  The time period may be three months.  Other time periods may be used.  The communication history
may be stored in data storage 120.  Communication module 202 may be preprogrammed to only pull numbers that are found more than once in the communication history.  Another threshold may be specified (for example, the communications module 202 may only
retrieve and store numbers from the communication history that show up a minimum of three times in the past month).
<br/><br/> Continuing with the previous example, assume Joe has made two calls to the number (678) 901-2345 in the past month (prior to submitting the disconnect request).  The number (678) 901-2345 may be included in the communication history for Joe's
smartphone.  The communication history for Joe's phone may be received from service provider 200 and saved in database 120.  Method 300 may proceed to block 310.
<br/><br/> At block 310, method 300 may then recycle the disconnected number.  Recycled numbers module 208 may place the disconnected number in a pool of recycled numbers, where it is available to be assigned to a different customer of service provider
200.  Recycled numbers module (or another module within switching system 210) may map the recycled number to the personalized message(s), communication history, and contact list stored in data storage 120.  "Mapping" the recycled number may mean
associating the recycled number with the stored communication history, contact list, and the one or more personalized messages.
<br/><br/> Continuing with the previous example, Joe Smith's number--(987) 654-3210--may be placed in a pool of recycled numbers associated with recycled numbers module 208.  One or more indicators may be stored with the recycled number that point to
locations in data storage 120 where Joe Smith's contact list, communication history, and/or personalized message(s) are stored.  This stored information will be associated with the number (987) 654-3210 in the recycled numbers pool.
<br/><br/> In one exemplary embodiment, switching system 210 may allow Joe Smith to associate specific personalized messages with specific phone numbers from his contact list or communication history.  For example, Joe Smith may have a specific message
that he wants to be played for family members that may mistakenly call his old number that is now recycled.  He may designate phone numbers associated with those family members in his contact list and/or communication history and select and/or create a
specific personalized message that will be played for calls from those numbers.  Method 300 may proceed to block 312.
<br/><br/> At block 312, method 300 may assign the recycled number to a different customer or user of the service provider.  Continuing with the previous example, a new user (Sarah Jones) may sign up for telephony services from service provider 200. 
Service provider 200 may retrieve an available number from the pool of recycled numbers and assign it to a user device used by Sarah Jones (such as an iPhone).  Service provider 200 may assign Joe Smith's old number--(978) 654-3210--to Sarah Jones'
iPhone.
<br/><br/> FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating the functionality of a particular embodiment.  This method is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out the methods described herein.  Method 400 shown in FIG. 4 may be executed or
otherwise performed by one or a combination of various systems.  The method 400 may be carried out through system 100 of FIG. 1 and/or the one or more modules shown in FIG. 2, by way of example, and various elements of FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 are referenced in
explaining method 400 of FIG. 4.  Each block shown in FIG. 4 represents one or more processes, methods, or subroutines carried out in method 400.  Method 400 may begin at block 402.
<br/><br/> At block 402, method 400 may receive communication information.  The communication information may be received from a network, such as network 108.  The communication information may be associated with a call from a user device to another user
device.  The communication information may include the number of the called party (for example, the number dialed by the calling party).  The communication information may include the number of the calling party.  In other embodiments, the communication
information may be associated with a text message/SMS/MMS message from a user device to another user device.  The communication information may include the email address of the calling or texting party, or an IP address associated with a VOW
communication.
<br/><br/> Continuing with the example from FIG. 3, the calling party may be Bob, who is associated with the number (678) 901-2345.  Bob may not be aware that Joe Smith has changed phone numbers and/or service providers.  Bob may be attempting to call Joe,
and may dial Joe's old number--(987) 654-3210.  Bob's call may be routed to network 108, and the communication information may be received by routing module 206.  Method 400 may proceed to block 404.
<br/><br/> At block 404, in response to receiving the communication information, method 400 may compare the received communication information with the recycled numbers in the recycled number pool.  Routing module 206 may compare the called (or texted)
number with the recycled numbers in the recycled numbers pool.  Continuing with the previous example, routing module 206 may compare the called number (987) 654-3210 with the pool of recycled numbers associated with recycled numbers module 208.  If the
routing module finds a match, method 400 may proceed to block 406.  If routing module 206 does not find a match, method 400 may proceed to block 416.  Continuing from the previous example, Bob may dial Joe Smith's old number that has been recycled and
assigned to Sarah Jones--(987) 654-3210.  This recycled number may have been stored in the recycled numbers pool, and routing module 206 may determine that a match exists.
<br/><br/> At block 406, if the routing module finds a match between the called (or texted) number and a number in the pool of recycled numbers, method 400 may retrieve the communication history for the recycled number.  Method 400 may additionally or
alternatively retrieve the contact list for the recycled number.  The communication history and/or contact list may be retrieved from data storage 120, based on the recycled number identified in block 404.  Continuing with the previous example, routing
module 206 may retrieve the communication history and contact list associated with the recycled number (987) 654-3210.  Method 400 may proceed to block 408.
<br/><br/> At block 408, after retrieving the communication history and/or contact list for the called number, method 400 may compare the calling number with the numbers in the retrieved communication history.  Method 400 may additionally or alternatively
compare the calling number with the numbers in the retrieved contact list.  The routing module 206 may perform the comparison.  If the routing module finds a match, method 400 may proceed to block 410.  If routing module 206 does not find a match, method
400 may proceed to block 416.  Continuing with the previous example, the routing module 206 may determine that the calling number--(678) 901-2345--matches one of the numbers in the communication history that was mapped to the recycled number.
<br/><br/> At block 410, if the calling number matches one or more numbers in the communications history or contact list, method 400 may retrieve one or more personalized messages and/or default messages.  Routing module 206 may retrieve any personalized
message(s) and/or default messages that were mapped to the recycled number in data storage 120.  If multiple personalized messages are associated with the recycled number in data storage 120, routing module may determine which one to play or transmit
based on the called number (for example, if Joe Smith had designated certain personalized messages to be played for certain callers).  Routing module 206 may determine which message to play or transmit based on the type of communication.  In other
embodiments, each personalized message may be associated with an expiration date or time.  In other embodiments, each personalized message may be associated with a time of day (for example, one personalized message may only be for calls received during
business hours).  In other embodiments, a personalized message may be associated with an area code (for example, one personalized message may only be played for calls received from the (925) area code).  In other embodiments, different personalized
messages may have been assigned to different calling numbers.
<br/><br/> Continuing with the previous example, Joe Smith's personalized message stored in data storage 120 may be retrieved.  Method 400 may proceed to block 412.
<br/><br/> At block 412, method 400 may play a retrieved message (based on the factors listed above).  The message may be an audio recording.  The message may be played for the calling party (Fred).  The message may state "You have reached a number that no
longer belongs to Joe Smith.  If you wish to continue with the call, press 1, or stay on the line." The message may be heard by Fred on his phone.  In other embodiments, the message may be a text message transmitted to Fred's user device.  In other
embodiments, the message may be an email.  In other embodiments, the message may be a video message that is transmitted or streamed to be played on Fred's user device.  Method 400 may proceed to block 414.
<br/><br/> At block 414, method 400 may determine whether to route the call.  The determination may be made based on how the calling party responds to the personalized message.  Continuing with the previous example, Fred may hear the message and then press
"1" on his mobile phone.  This response may be received by routing module 206.  Routing module 206 may then provide routing information to network 108, service provider 200, service portal 112, or other routers and/or gateways, allowing Fred's call to be
routed to Sarah Jones iPhone (the user device that is now associated with Joe Smith's old number).  Fred may hear the message and stay on the line.  Routing module 206 may be configured to automatically route the call to the called party if no response
is received after a predetermined period of time.  Fred may hear the message and hang up, thus ending the call.
<br/><br/> At block 416, the call may be routed to the called party.
