       <p> Systems, methods, and computer program products are disclosed which
     facilitate collecting information about users, including responses to
     poll prompts, and analyzing such information in order to determine
     correlations and inter-relationships of information and information
     areas. In an aspect, information from many users is collected across a
     variety of user interaction channels and computing device platforms. Such
     information is analyzed in order to generate profiles of like-minded
     individuals. Such profiles may be useful for recommending peer-to-peer
     connection between individuals, marketing products and services to
     individuals with similar attributes and traits, and examining changes in
     individual preferences over time or in response to external factors.

least one grouping when the user opinion uncertainty is less than the user opinion threshold value;  and generate peer-to-peer connections to members in the at least one grouping on the graphical user interface displayed by the respective user through
the polling infrastructure, wherein said members being associated with the polling infrastructure, wherein the at least one grouping stored in the correlation database correlates with user opinions for the topic.
<br/><br/> 9.  The system of claim 8, wherein the polling infrastructure further to: calculate a user opinion distribution mean, calculate an at least one grouping distribution, and compare the user opinion distribution mean and the at least one grouping
distribution mean;  wherein, if the comparison of the user opinion distribution mean and the at least one grouping distribution mean is statistically significant, the at least one grouping is not stored in the correlation database.
<br/><br/> 10.  The system of claim 8, wherein the user database is further configured to receive user opinions provided via a plurality of computing devices.
<br/><br/> 11.  The system of claim 10, further comprising: at least one poll server, communicatively coupled to the at least one web server, to present the plurality of users with a plurality of polls over time.
<br/><br/> 12.  The system of claim 8, further comprising: at least one presentation server, communicatively coupled to the at least one web server, to present targeted information to a group member via the plurality of computing devices;  wherein the
group member has attributes associated with the identified at least one grouping.
<br/><br/> 13.  The system of claim 12, wherein the targeted information is chosen based on the user opinions associated with the identified at least one grouping.
<br/><br/> 14.  One or more non-transitory, tangible computer storage media having stored thereon multiple instructions that facilitate identification of correlations in user data by, when executed by one or more processors of a computing device, causing
the one or more processors to: receive, by a server of a polling infrastructure communicating over a network, user opinions from a plurality of users, a user opinion of a respective user being from a user account on a third party network platform
associated with the respective user, the user opinions relating to a topic, the polling infrastructure is different from the third party network platform;  receive, by the polling infrastructure, a plurality of attribute sets, each of the plurality of
attribute sets comprising user information from a plurality of users related to one of a plurality of attribute subjects;  select, by the polling infrastructure, a subset comprising at least one of the plurality of attribute sets;  create, by the polling
infrastructure, at least one grouping, each grouping comprising user information associated with each of the at least one of the plurality of attribute sets comprising the subset;  create, by the polling infrastructure, a user opinion distribution of the
user opinions associated with the at least one grouping;  calculate, by the polling infrastructure, the user opinion uncertainty of the user opinion distribution;  determine, by the polling infrastructure, if the user opinion uncertainty is less than a

<center><b><i>Description</i></b></center> <hr/> <br/><br/>FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
<br/><br/> The present disclosure relates to individual and group behavior analysis, and more particularly to systems, methods and computer program products for correlating information about individuals across larger groups.
<br/><br/>BACKGROUND
<br/><br/> Historically, public opinion polls have been used in the United States to assess the opinions of the population on a given issue, individual, or group.  Such polls have also been widely used to determine public or group sentiment regarding
companies, products, potential future products, and the like.  A properly-formulated poll provides a snapshot of the content, intensity, and consistency of opinion for a target group.  Polls have been used to capture the opinions of large groups, such as
likely United States voters, medium-sized groups such as "U.S.  Republican voters," and small groups such as "Democratic voters living in Austin, Tex." Public opinion polling can identify individual and group desires, motivations, and opinions on issues
such as specific topics, individuals, political parties, and philosophical leanings.
<br/><br/> The results of an individual poll comprise survey responses from individuals who participated in the poll and statistical analyses of the survey responses of some or all of the participating individuals.  These statistical analyses are commonly
known as a poll's "results." Once collected, polling information is widely used by news organizations, political campaigns, and businesses for a variety of purposes including product planning, targeted advertising and, in the case of political polls,
shaping the tenor of a candidate's political platform in order to better connect with potential voters.  Poll results, in particular political poll results, may also reported to the public at large.
<br/><br/> Many methods of conducting public opinion polls are time-intensive, costly, and inefficient because the location of suitable poll respondents willing to participate and complete the poll can be problematic.  For example, telephone polling has
traditionally been used to perform political polling.  Telephone polling has a very large nonresponse bias because polling calls are missed, many individuals do not answer calls from unknown telephone numbers and, of the individuals that do answer the
initial call, many refuse to complete the survey.  Failed attempts vastly outnumber successful interviews of individuals for a given poll.  In order to gather 1,200 complete responses, it is not uncommon for 40,000 phone calls to be placed--a 3% return
rate.
<br/><br/> Polling is one approach to gathering information about individual and group behavior.  Other approaches include observation of group and individual purchasing habits, Internet browsing habits, and the like.  Information about individual and
group behavior is routinely collected by a variety of sources.
<br/><br/> Given the foregoing, what is needed are systems, methods, and computer program products which collect information from individuals and groups, and analyze the collected data in order to generate actionable results.  Additionally, systems,
methods, and computer program products are needed which collect information and construct profiles indicating preferences of an individual or group, based on the information collected.
<br/><br/> Systems, methods, and computer program products are also needed which aggregate information collected about individuals and groups and analyzes such information in order to generate profiles indicating interest in a variety of topics, products,
and services.  In particular, analysis of such information, which is updated as new information is collected, is needed.  Additionally, facilitating analysis of what factors indicate an individual or group will behave in a certain way (e.g., vote
Republican, buy a new computer) is needed.
<br/><br/>SUMMARY
<br/><br/> This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.  This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the subject matter,
nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the subject matter.
<br/><br/> This disclosure addresses the above-described needs by providing methods, computer program products, and systems for facilitating peer-to-peer connections based on collections of consumer choices and behaviors.  The present disclosure gathers
polling data more effectively than previous methods by packaging data collection tools within a social networking environment.  The user's motivation to provide data is high because the user receives a potentially long-lasting benefit: acquaintance with
other individuals who share similar values and levels of passion about selected topics.
<br/><br/> In an aspect, a user's opinions are received regarding specific topics.  User opinion may be received via user responses to one or more polls presented to the user.  A poll is comprised of a prompt and a two or more answer choices.  For example,
a poll may comprise a prompt with the following query, "Should the government support stem cell research?", with the accompanying answer choices "Yes" and "No." The user may then select an answer choice which reflects their opinion on the presented
prompt.
<br/><br/> Received opinions are analyzed and integrated into a multi-dimensional user profile.  The multi-dimensional user profile comprises information specific to the user including received opinions, information about the user received from third
parties (e.g., information about the user from their FACEBOOK.RTM.  account (available from <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Inc.  of Menlo Park, Calif.)), and information received directly from the user, such as demographic information and political party affiliation.  In
some aspects, the multi-dimensional user profile comprises information about the user's interest levels in broader topics such as economics, federal government budget issues, crime, and immigration.  In another aspect, the user is presented with a
plurality of polls which are selected to facilitate identification of user choices and behaviors including, but not limited to, prompt-specific political beliefs (e.g., if the government should support stem cell research), the user's political leanings
on a specific issue (e.g., government involvement in healthcare), and the user's overall political leaning (e.g., liberal, conservative, progressive, etc.).  User choices, opinions, and behaviors are included in the user's multi-dimensional user profile
which may be stored in a computer readable medium.
<br/><br/> In some aspects, multi-dimensional user profiles are created comprising previously-received user responses to polls and user information, including user demographic information.  Polls, customized to individuals, are presented to the user
community and poll results are collected, indicating the frequency distribution of the user community's opinion of the topic prompt presented.  Profile information of the user community from individual user's multi-dimensional profiles is analyzed and
frequency distributions of user attributes are created.  In an aspect, user attributes are divided into static attributes that include, but are not limited to, political party, responses to previous polls, location, annual income, education, and other
user demographic information, as well as dynamic attributes that include, but limited to, issue interest levels, political leanings along issues, and revealed preferences.  Frequency distributions of user attributes are compared to poll results.  This
comparison facilitates the location of influential user attributes for a give poll or topic.

FACEBOOK.RTM.  status update (available from <b><i>Facebook,</i></b> Inc.  of Menlo Park, Calif.)), images, contributions from other users 102 in the form of discussion entries, and audiovisual clips.
<br/><br/> In some aspects, one or more media recommendations 306 are related to poll topic 204 or poll 202 presented to user 102.  For example, screenshot 300 depicts a poll 202 about a poll topic 204 ("Election 2012").  Media recommendations 306
discussing presidential election issues are presented which are related to poll topic 204.  In some aspects, media recommendations 306 are selectable Internet hyperlinks.  In another aspect, media recommendations 306 are presented to user 102 based on
their interest in topics indicated by information stored (e.g., in database 122) in a multi-dimensional profile associated with user 102.  For example, media recommendations 306 related to the United States economy may be presented to user 102 if their
multi-dimensional profile indicates a strong interest in economic issues.
<br/><br/> In some aspects, a user 102 is presented with a member listing 308 of other users 102 who share similar characteristics with them.  In one aspect, characteristic similarity is determined by comparing information contained in each user's
multi-dimensional profile.  Member listing 308 may be a linear list, a grid, a collage, or another arrangement or data structure of user information related to other users 102 who share similar characteristics with a given user 102.  In some aspects,
information about users 102 is received directly from responses to polls 202 and user-entered demographic information.  Users 102 listed in member listing 308 share one or more characteristics with a given user 102, including congruency of opinion on a
poll topic 204, the same or similar answer choice 208 selection for a given poll 202, similar demographic information, and similarity of interest level for one or more poll topics 204.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIGS. 4 and 5, screenshots 400 and 500 illustrate exemplary graphical user interfaces for receiving user opinions regarding multiple polls 202, according to an aspect of the present disclosure.
<br/><br/> In the aspect depicted in FIG. 4, additional polls 202 are presented to user 102 via a pop-up frame 402.  In some aspects, only pop-up frame 402 is user selectable.  In order to access other portions of the present disclosure, an exit 404 button
must be selected by user 102.  User 102 selects an answer choice 208 via answer selector 210 and confirms selection of answer choice 208 via answer submitter 212.  In some aspects (e.g., the aspect depicted in FIG. 5), user 102 confirms selection of
answer choice 208 via answer submitter 212 and is presented with an answer confirmation 502 before another poll 202 is presented to the user.  Answer confirmation 502 is a graphical representation indicating that user's answer choice 208 selection has
been received.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIGS. 6-7, screenshots 600 and 700 which illustrate exemplary graphical user interfaces for presenting information about other users 102 which have been recommended to a given user 102, according to an aspect of the present
disclosure, are shown.
<br/><br/> Information about users 102, including received opinions, received answer choices 208, information received from third parties, and directly received user information (e.g., demographic information and political party affiliation) may be stored
in database 122.  In some aspects, a multi-dimensional profile is created using such information for a given user 102.  In some aspects, received information stored in the multi-dimensional user profile comprises information about the user's interest
levels in poll topics 204, such as economics, federal government budget issues, crime, and immigration.  The multi-dimensional profile may comprise information about the user's interest levels in non-political poll topics 204, such as arts,
entertainment, recreation, vacation preferences, and the like.
<br/><br/> In some aspects, personnel from the application service provider that make infrastructure 101 available to users 102 may create a poll 202 related to one or more poll topics 204.  Such personnel would assign one or more values to answer choices
208 which correspond to user interest and position for poll topic 204.  For example, a poll 202 comprising answer choices 208a-d may be created.  Poll 202 may be related to a poll topic 204 such as "Education." Answer choice 208a may be a selection
indicating high user interest in poll topic 208 and considered a "liberal" position.  Answer choice 208b may be a selection indicating medium user interest in poll topic 204 and considered a "liberal" position.  Answer choice 208c may be a selection
indicating low user interest in poll topic 204 and considered a "conservative" position.  Answer choice 208d may be a selection indicating high user interest in poll topic 204 and considered a "conservative" position.  In some aspects, user 102 chooses
answer choice 208a-d and the interest level and position values assigned to the answer choice 208 are stored in the user's multi-dimensional profile.  In some aspects, the multi-dimensional profile contains some or all of the values associated with
answer choices 208 selected by the user.
<br/><br/> Information contained in the multi-dimensional user profile may be analyzed and presented in a profile summary 602 (shown, for clarity, only as profile summaries 602a-c in FIG. 6), each being associated with a particular user 102.  Profile
summary 602 is a visual representation of an analysis of received user information.  Each profile summary 602 facilitates identification of other users 102 with similar characteristics to a given user under consideration.  In some aspects, profile
summary 602 is a graphical representation.  For example, profile summaries 602 contained in screenshot 600 are icons comprising varying amounts of red and blue.  The amount of red contained in a profile summary 602 indicates the number and degree of
conservative positions adopted by user 102 associated with profile summary 602, compared to the number and degree of liberal positions adopted as indicated by the amount of blue displayed.
<br/><br/> Profile summary 602a indicates a high number of liberal positions relative to conservative positions.  Other user 102 recommendations for a specific user 102 are presented in member list 308.  In some aspects, member list 308 comprises one or
more usernames 604 (shown, for clarity, only as usernames 604b-c in FIG. 6) and one or more corresponding profile summaries 602.  Profile summary 602c for username 604c "edwinhill" indicates slightly more conservative positions than the specific user 102
interacting with screenshot 600 as indicated by profile summary 602a.  Profile summary 602b contains a question mark indicating insufficient information has been received about user 102 with username 604b "leeu" to create a profile summary 602.  In other
aspects, profile summary 602 is simply a text label (e.g., "evangelical conservative," "neo conservative," "moderate," "liberal," "very liberal," etc.).
<br/><br/> In some aspects, username 604 is selectable by user 102.  Selection of username 604 presents user 102 with additional information about user 102 represented by username 604.  For example, as shown in FIG. 7, selection of username 604b presents
user 102 with a detailed information page about user 102 with username 604b "edwinhill."
<br/><br/> In one aspect, the detailed information presented about another user 102 includes username 604, profile summary 602, and position detail list 704 comprising one or more poll topic positions 706 (shown as poll topic positions 706a-c in FIG. 7)
related to one or more poll topics 204 (shown as poll topics 204a-c in FIG. 7).  Poll topic position 706 is a visual representation of information related to the corresponding poll topic 204 which is contained in the presented multi-dimensional profile.
<br/><br/> In an aspect, information contained in a multi-dimensional profile is analyzed in order to generate a visual representation of a user's position for poll topic 204.  In some aspects, poll topic position 706 is a visual representation indicating
a user's political position (i.e., how "liberal" or "conservative" is user 102) about poll topic 204.  In other aspects, poll topic position 706 is a visual representation indicating more than one value associated with poll topic 204.
<br/><br/> In addition to presenting detailed information about another user 102, aspects in accordance with screenshot 700 may also present a messaging client 702.  Messaging client 702 is an internal (system 100) messaging service configured to allow
users 102 to send messages to one another.  In some aspects, messaging client 702 is configured to allow text-based messages to be sent.  In another aspect, messaging client 702 is configured to allow inclusion of hyperlinks, images, audiovisual clips,
and other multimedia files within the message.
<br/><br/> In some aspects, information presented to user 102 includes a position detail list 704.  Position detail list 704 is a visual representation of received information about the user 102.  For example, in FIG. 7, user position list 704 corresponds
with user 102 with username 604b "edwinhill" and comprises poll topic position 706a corresponding with user 102 information related to poll topic 204a "Labor Issues." Poll topic position 706a represents a lack of information in the user's
multi-dimensional profile with respect to poll topic 204a because insufficient information has been received.  The multi-dimensional profile corresponding with username 604b contains sufficient information to present poll topic position 706b and poll
topic position 706c related to poll topic 204b "Senior Issues" and poll topic 204c "Taxes." Poll topic position 706b and poll topic position 706c are visual representations of sliding scales which indicate that this user is more "liberal" on poll topic
204b and poll topic 204c.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 8, screenshot 800 of an exemplary graphical user interface for presenting a user 102 with information contained in a multi-dimensional profile related to selected poll topics 204, according to the present disclosure, is
shown.
<br/><br/> In an aspect, poll topic positions 706 (shown, for clarity, only as poll topic positions 706a, 706i, and 706j in FIG. 8) are visual representations indicating one or more values associated with poll topic 204.  In some aspects, poll topic
position 706 is configured to visually represent user's 102 political position (i.e., how "liberal" or "conservative" is user 102) via the colors displayed in poll topic position 706 and is configured to display user interest in poll topic 204 via the
height of poll topic 204 and poll topic position 706.
<br/><br/> In the aspect depicted in FIG. 8, poll topic position 706 is configured to visually represent a user's political position (i.e., how "liberal" or "conservative" user 102 is) via the location of a slider between the left-end portion and the
right-end portion of poll topic position 706.  Here, a user's "liberal" position on a corresponding poll topic 204 is indicated via placement of the slider (depicted as a white bar in FIG. 8) closer to the left-end portion of poll topic position 706
(exemplified by poll topic position 706a).  A user's "conservative" position on a corresponding poll topic 204 is indicated via placement of the slider closer to the right-end portion of poll topic position 706 (exemplified by poll topic position 706i
and poll topic position 706j in FIG. 8).
<br/><br/> Poll topic position 706 is also configured to display user interest in poll topic 204 via the height of poll topic 204 and poll topic position 706.  For example, poll topic 204j and corresponding poll topic position 706j represent low user
interest value in poll topic 204j via a relatively small height.  Poll topic 204i and corresponding poll topic position 706i, however, indicate a medium user interest value in poll topic 204i.  Poll topic 204a and corresponding poll topic position 706a
are very large compared to other poll topics 204 and poll topic positions 706 presented in screenshot 800, indicating a high user interest value in poll topic 204a.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 9, a flowchart illustrating an exemplary process 900 for receiving user 102 answer choice 208 selections, according to an aspect of the present disclosure, is shown.  Process 900, which may execute within system 100, begins
at step 902 with control passing immediately to step 904.
<br/><br/> In step 904, user 102 is presented with a poll 202 (e.g., as shown in screenshots 200 or 400).  Poll 202 is presented to user 102 such that user 102 may select one or more answer choices 208 indicating their opinion of prompt 206.  The user's
selection is received in step 906.  In some aspects, each received user selection of answer choice 208 is stored in a multi-dimensional profile for such user 102.  In some aspects, media recommendations 306 and member listing 308 are updated upon each
iteration of step 906.
<br/><br/> Optionally, in step 908, user 102 is presented with poll result 302 corresponding to poll 202 user 102 participated in during step 906.  In some aspects, poll result 302 is presented to user 102 as shown in screenshot 300.  Upon completion of
step 908, process 900 ends as indicated by step 910.
<br/><br/> In alternate aspects, process 900 is repeatable such that user 102 is presented with a plurality of polls 202 in succession and the user's selection of answer choices 208 corresponding with each of the polls 202 are recorded in the user's
multi-dimensional profile.  In an aspect, polls 202 presented in succession to user 102 are dependent on the user's previous selections of answer choices 208.  For example, subsequent polls 202 presented to user 102 are chosen to identify their opinion
of poll topic 204 "Education" in response to an initial received user selection related to poll topic 204 "Education."
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 10, a flowchart illustrating process 1000 for presenting a specific user 102 with information about other users 102, according to an aspect of the present invention, is shown.  In such an aspect, process 1000 facilitates
the suggestion of other users 102 with whom the specific user 102 may enjoy interacting with.  Process 1000 which may execute within system 100, begins at step 1002 with control passing immediately to step 1004.
<br/><br/> In step 1004, a user's multi-dimensional profile is accessed.  That is, at least one piece of received information (or trait) contained in the multi-dimensional profile is accessed.  Accessed information may include, but is not limited to, a
received answer choice 208 selection, a political position value on a given poll topic 204, an interest level value on a given poll topic 204, and/or any demographic information.
<br/><br/> Upon accessing such information in step 1004, step 1006 is executed.  In step 1006, information accessed from the user's multi-dimensional profile is compared to information in other user 102 multi-dimensional profiles.  In one aspect, process
1000 generates an output for a specific user suggesting other users 102 with whom the specific user may enjoy interacting.  The user 102 being presented with information is denoted as "user K" and each one of the other users 102 with whom they may enjoy
interacting is denoted as "user L." Thus, comparison of "user K" and "user L" is based at least in part on evaluation of vector distance between individual profiles according to the following equation: D.sub.K-L=
/(.SIGMA..sub.I(W(I,K)*(P(I,L)-P(I,K)).sup.2));
<br/><br/> where: D.sub.K-L is the vector distance of the profile of user K from that of user L (user K's impression of how similar user L is in terms of ideology) W(I,K) is the factor that represents interest level information of user K for topic I P(I,L)
is the political position value of user K on a poll topic I; and P(I,K) is the political position value of user L on poll topic I.
<br/><br/> In such an aspect, vector distance is directional.  That is: D.sub.K-L.noteq.D.sub.L-K.
<br/><br/> Vector directionality results from the manner of calculating interest levels in this aspect.  The computation of D.sub.K-L uses interest level weights W(I,K), while the computation for D.sub.L-K uses interest level weights W(I,L).  The selection
of users 102 from a group G of users 102, paired with a user K will be based on an analytical ordering of distances D.sub.K-X|X.epsilon.G.
<br/><br/> Upon completion of step 1006, step 1008 is initiated where information about one or more users 102 with similar multi-dimensional profiles is selected.  In some aspects, users 102 are selected with only similar interest levels and opinions for a
given poll topic 204.  In other aspects, users 102 are selected where the calculated D.sub.K-L is low.  The directional computation of vector distances in some aspects of step 1006 identifies where similarities exist on political positions and where
interest values match.  Process 1000 also identifies where interest values match but political positions are very different.  In some aspects, users 102 are presented where the calculated D.sub.K-L is high, due to interest level value similarity but
political position difference.  This type of matching ensures that recommendations are directed at users 102 more likely to initiate an issue-based interaction.
<br/><br/> Upon completion of step 1008, process 1000 proceeds to step 1010.  In step 1010, information related to one or more users 102 (i.e., "users L") identified in step 1008 is presented via, for example, computing device 104.  In some aspects,
similar users 102 are presented as shown in screenshot 300.  In other aspects, similar users 102 are presented as shown in screenshot 600.  In another aspect, information about selected users 102 is simply stored and not presented to user K, creating a
grouping of users 102 who may respond consistently and positively to certain types of advertising messaging, engagement communication messaging, coupons, advocacy messaging, and the like.
<br/><br/> Upon completion of step 1010, process 1000 ends as indicated by step 1012.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 11, a flowchart illustrating an exemplary process 1100 for identifying relationships between user 102 information and received user opinions, according to the present disclosure, is shown.
<br/><br/> For the purposes of process 1100, information related to an area of interest is called an "attribute." Areas of interest may include, but are not limited to, political party affiliation, gender, age, race, answer choice 208 selection, interest
in a given poll topic 204, answer choice 208 given, and political position values.  Areas of interest may also include buying habits, brand loyalty, home location, philosophies on raising children, and the like.
<br/><br/> For the purposes of this disclosure, "attribute set" or "set of attributes" and/or the plural form of these terms are used interchangeably to refer to one or more data sets comprising information from a plurality of users 102 relating to a
common attribute subject.  For example, an attribute set may comprise the ages of all users 102 utilizing infrastructure 101.  Similarly, an attribute set may comprise soft drink purchasing habit information for users 102 utilizing infrastructure 101
between the ages of 18 and 25.
<br/><br/> Process 1100 facilitates identification of attributes which correlate with received user opinions, the frequency distribution of an answer choice 208 within a result 302, user buying habits, or other information collected about users 102,
regardless of origin (collectively, "poll results").  For example, process 1100 facilitates determining if users 102 with the attribute of being associated with the Democratic Party correlate with selection of a pro-choice abortion answer choice 208.
<br/><br/> In another aspect, process 1100 facilitates determining if users 102 with the attribute of being between the ages of 18 and 34 correlate with the selection of an answer choice 208 indicating interest in buying a new convertible automobile.
<br/><br/> In yet another aspect, process 1100 facilitates determining if users 102 with the attributes of being female, living in the Midwest, and college educated correlate with the selection of an answer choice 208 indicating interest in switching the
brand of razor they use.
<br/><br/> Process 1100 which may execute within system 100, begins at step 1102 with control passing immediately to step 1104.
<br/><br/> In step 1104, one or more attributes are identified to compare with poll results.  In an aspect, the identified attribute(s) are chosen for comparison to poll results from a given poll 202.
<br/><br/> In another aspect, the identified attribute(s) are chosen for comparison to poll results received from third parties, such as online purchasing habits.  For example, the attribute may be "owning three or more vehicles" (V) which has been chosen
to compare to how much, if any, garage organization products such users 102 purchase online.  Similarly, the attribute may be "owning three or more vehicles" (V) which has been chosen to compare to how many, if any, pets users 102 own.  Note, as shown in
the previous example, the attribute chosen may be compared poll results which initially appear to have no direct relationship with the attribute.
<br/><br/> One or more attributes may be identified such that process 1100 is executed multiple times to compare the identified attributes.  In one aspect, attributes age (A), gender (G), and environmental leaning (E) are identified.  Identification may be
done by a user 102, application service provider personnel, or another means, depending on aspect.  In other aspects, identified attributes are combinations of two or more other attributes.  For example, combinations of age and gender (AG), age and
environment (AE), environment and gender (EG), and age, gender and environment (AGE) may be considered for use in process 1100.
<br/><br/> In step 1106, the distribution of the attribute identified in step 1104 is calculated.  The calculation may be done by any method known to those skilled in the relevant art(s), including calculating the frequency distribution of the attribute. 
For example, calculation of the distribution of political party affiliation for a group of users 102 may reveal a 50% Democratic Party affiliation and a 50% Republican Party affiliation.
<br/><br/> In step 1108, the uncertainty of the attribute identified in step 1104 is calculated.  In one aspect, uncertainty is determined via a dispersion analysis.  The dispersion may be calculated via determining the Shannon Entropy (or "s-entropy"; see
Claude E. Shannon &amp; Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication, Univ.  of Illinois Press, 1949, ISBN 0-252-72548-4, incorporated herein by reference) of the distribution calculated in step 1106.  For attribute X with N users 102 distributed
among three attribute choices p, q, and r as N.sub.p, N.sub.q, and N.sub.r, the s-entropy is measured as: S.sub.X=1-(N.sub.p.sup.2+N.sub.q.sup.2+N.sub.r.sup.2)/N.sup.2
<br/><br/> In an aspect, the attribute choice is a possible response in a poll result, such as an income level, political affiliation, interest level, and the like.
<br/><br/> In other aspects, uncertainty may be determined using methods apparent to those skilled in the relevant art(s) after reading the description herein.
<br/><br/> In step 1110, uncertainty values, such as S values, calculated in step 1108 are compared to a pre-defined or pre-set threshold value.  In an aspect, attributes with an S value below a pre-defined threshold are chosen as indicative attributes for
correlation with poll results and process 1100 proceeds to step 1114.  Where an S value for an attribute is greater than a pre-defined threshold, process 1100 proceeds to step 1112, where the attribute is discarded.  After an attribute is discarded in
step 1112, process 1100 ends as indicated by step 1122.
<br/><br/> Where process 1100 proceeds to step 1114 with an attribute with S value below a pre-defined threshold, the distribution of poll results being examined is calculated.  The calculation may be done by any method known to those skilled in the
relevant art(s), including calculating the frequency distribution of poll results.
<br/><br/> In step 1116, the attribute distribution and the poll results distribution are compared.  In an aspect, the difference between the mean value of the attribute distribution and the poll results distribution is calculated.  If the mean calculated
in step 1116 is greater than a pre-determined value, determining step 1118 is negative and the attribute is discarded.  If the mean value calculated in step 1116 is not significant, determining step 1118 is positive, the attribute is indicative of the
information the attribute was compared to (e.g., users 102 who own a Prius.RTM.  vehicle (available from Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan) are more likely to self-identify as Democratic), and process 1100 proceeds to step 1120.
<br/><br/> In an alternative aspect, the attribute distribution and the poll results distribution are compared via application of genetic algorithms (see S. N. Sivanandam, et. Al., Introduction to Genetic Algorithms, Springer, 2007, ISBN 354073189X,
incorporated herein by reference).  If the difference between the attribute distribution and poll results distribution is more significant than a pre-defined value, step 1118 executes as previously described step 1112--wherein the attribute is discarded. If the difference between the attribute distribution and poll results distribution is not significant, process 1100 proceeds to step 1120.
<br/><br/> In step 1120, the attribute is selected.  Selection indicates that the attribute identified in step 1104 correlates to the behavior of poll results.  Selection of the attribute in this manner provides an attribute which may be utilized to
predict user 102, individual, or group behaviors regarding related poll results.  Upon completion of step 1120, process 1100 terminates as indicated by step 1122.
<br/><br/> In an aspect, process 1100 may be utilized to identify whether other individuals will behave in a specific manner, based on their attributes.  For example, process 1100 may indicate that individuals with the attribute of having a residence on a
body of water (e.g., a riverfront home) are likely to, according to poll results, give 12% or more of their income to charity.  Such information is useful to a charity, for example, because the charity may use it to target mass mailing campaigns.
<br/><br/> Similarly, process 1100 may indicate that individuals with the attribute of regularly purchasing automobiles from domestic manufacturers are likely to, according to poll results, vacation in Mexico.  Such information may be useful to domestic
automobile manufacturers because they can place advertisements in vacation destinations within Mexico, thereby reaching other individuals with similar preferences and tastes.
<br/><br/> Process 1100 may be repeated over time in order to determine if selected attributes continue to be associated with given poll results.  In this manner, process 1100 may be utilized to facilitate individual, group, and/or audience response to
messaging, advertising, external factors, and other changes, such as current events.
<br/><br/> Referring now to FIG. 12, a block diagram illustrating an exemplary computer system useful for implementing the present disclosure is shown.  That is FIG. 12 sets forth illustrative computing functionality 1200 that may be used to implement any
